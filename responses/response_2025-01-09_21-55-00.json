However, comments from Nvidia's CEO negatively impacted Palantir and quantum-computing stocks, causing their prices to decline.\n\n4. **Impact**: 3 \n\nThe news mentions a rebound in Nvidia's stock price, which is positive, but the magnitude of the \"claw back\" is unclear. The CEO's comments causing declines in other sectors could indirectly affect Nvidia, but the overall impact on Nvidia itself seems limited based on the provided text.  Therefore, the impact score is relatively low.\n",

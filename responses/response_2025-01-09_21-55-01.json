    "step1_result": "Primary check: The provided text mentions \"Wall Street's leading AI stock,\" which could imply Nvidia, but doesn't explicitly state it.  Therefore, this analysis proceeds with the assumption it *might* relate to Nvidia, but with strong caveats.\n\n1. **Categories:** Market Sentiment, Speculative or Rumor-based News, General Market Trends.\n\n2. **Simplified Category:** Market Sentiment.\n\n3. **Summary:** The article suggests potential negative developments (\"a perfect storm\") are looming for a leading AI stock, possibly Nvidia, in the coming year.  No specifics are given.\n\n4. **Impact**: 3\n\nThis article is highly vague. While negative sentiment could impact Nvidia's stock price, the lack of concrete information limits the potential market reaction.  If the article referred specifically to NVDA, the impact might be slightly higher (perhaps a 4), but the vagueness keeps the impact low.\n",

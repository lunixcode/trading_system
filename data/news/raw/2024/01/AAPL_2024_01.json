        "title": "Apple to report Q1 earnings as investors focus on China iPhone sales",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, as investors seek more insight into the company’s iPhone sales performance, particularly in China. Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple’s stock in early January on fears that the iPhone 15 is underperforming in China.\n\nThat, coupled with TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicting a 15% decline in iPhone shipments, has inflicted pain on Apple’s stock price, with shares falling 3.5% over the last month.\n\nA strong performance in the quarter and an upbeat outlook for iPhone sales, however, could begin to turn around the company’s stock performance.\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street is expecting Apple to report earnings per share of $2.11 on revenue of $117.9 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark an increase from last year when Apple reported EPS of $1.88 on revenue of $117.2 billion. The iPhone 15 Pro phones are shown during an announcement of new products on the Apple campus in Cupertino, Calif., Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut overall revenue in Greater China, Apple’s third-largest sales region behind North America and Europe, is expected to fall from $23.9 billion to $23.5 billion. Analysts say a resurgent Huawei, which is selling high-end smartphones that rival Apple’s, and China’s faltering economic recovery are cutting into Apple’s sales in the region.\n\nThe company’s iPhone revenue is expected to come in at $68.6 billion, which would be a step up from the same period last year when Apple reported iPhone revenue of $65.78 billion. Apple’s Mac revenue also appears set for a slight recovery, with analysts anticipating sales of $7.9 billion in the quarter versus $7.7 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nBut iPad revenue is expected to drop more than $2 billion to $7.06 billion compared to $9.4 billion last year. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will introduce refreshed iPads and Macs in March, which could help goose sales numbers for both business segments in the year ahead.\n\nWearables, home, and accessories should generate revenue of $12 billion in the quarter, down from $13.5 billion in Q1 last year. Apple has been contending with an ongoing patent battle with medical device maker Masimo, which forced the company to temporarily take the device off of store shelves.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has since removed the blood oxygen sensor component that triggered the dispute from its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches, but it’s unclear how much of an impact that has had on sales.\n\nApple’s Services segment, meanwhile, is expected to see sales of $23.4 billion, up from $20.8 billion. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nApple’s earnings come as the company prepares to launch its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. The device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, goes on sale Feb. 2 for $3,499. And while it’s certainly an impressive product, its price tag will likely limit sales among most consumers.\n\nWhile Apple doesn’t release exact device sales figures, it will be interesting to see what kind of commentary CEO Tim Cook has to offer around the initial uptake in Vision Pro preorders and how the developer community is responding. After all, if the Vision Pro is to be a success, it’ll need developers to build apps for it.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) announced its first quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on better than anticipated iPhone sales.\n\nIn the quarter, Apple saw earnings per share of $2.18 on revenue of $119.6 billion. Analysts were anticipating earnings of $2.11 on revenue of $117.9 billion.\n\nShares of Apple were down more than 1% following the report.\n\nIn the quarter, Apple reported iPhone sales of $69.7 billion versus expectations of $68.6 billion. But sales out of China, the company's third largest region after North American and Europe, were lower than anticipated, topping out at just $20.8 billion. Wall Street was looking for sales of $23.5 billion.\n\nApple is dealing with both a sluggish Chinese economy as well as a resurgent Huawei in the country, which has hurt sales in the region. But strong showings in both North American and Europe helped buoy the company.\n\n“Today Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.\n\n“We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.\n\nApple’s Mac revenue topped out at $7.8 billion in the first quarter, missing analysts' expectations of $7.9 billion. The company's iPad revenue also missed at $7 billion. Wall Street was looking for $7.1 billion. That's a steep drop from the $9.4 billion the iPad business generated last year.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will introduce refreshed iPads and Macs in March, which could help goose sales numbers for both business segments in the year ahead.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 15 best low cost stocks to buy under $75. You can skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market investment trends, and go directly to read 5 Best Low Cost Stocks To Buy Under $75.\n\nThe latest economic indicators suggest that the US economy remains resilient and is in better shape than anticipated, defying concerns of a recession. According to the Commerce Department's report on economic growth, the US economy expanded by 3.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by robust consumer spending on healthcare, dining out, and automobiles. Additionally, holiday season sales surpassed expectations, reaching $964.4 billion during November and December, according to data from the National Retail Federation.\n\nThe strength of the US economy, coupled with the possibility of future rate cuts, has emboldened market bulls to make more optimistic predictions and set higher targets for the S&P 500. For instance, Katie Stockon, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, suggested on CNBC that the S&P 500 could potentially reach 6,100 in the long term if new highs are achieved. Despite some stocks being overbought, Stockon noted signs of strength in the market, indicating the beginning of a bull market. Furthermore, Lori Calvasina from RBC Capital Markets remarked in December that while the market is expected to grow gradually in the second half of 2024, investors may need to pause to digest the significant gains witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn such an environment, potential investors looking to dip their feet in the stock market often seek out low-cost yet potentially lucrative stocks to navigate the world of finance. While these stocks may not provide the same level of security as mega-cap firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), they offer the potential for decent short-term returns due to their volatility. In this context, some of the best cheap stocks to buy include CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), along with others listed below.\n\nStory continues 15 Best low cost Stocks To Buy Under $75\n\nA trader on the floor of a bustling stock exchange, surrounded by a sea of monitors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used stock screeners to shortlist stocks that were trading at a share price of less than $75. The compilation of cheap stocks is derived from their popularity among the 910 hedge funds monitored by Insider Monkey. The roster of 15 best cheap stocks to buy under $75 is organized in ascending order based on the count of hedge funds that held each stock. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)\n\nShare Price as of January 27: $46.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\n\nThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), commonly known as Kroger, is a prominent American retail corporation operating an extensive network of supermarkets and multi-department stores across 35 states in the United States. With a presence in over 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) holds a significant position in the global food retail industry.\n\nKroger Co (NYSE:KR) disclosed its third-quarter financial results earlier in November of 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.95 for the period, surpassing expectations by $0.03. Additionally, the reported revenue stood at $33.96 billion, exceeding estimates by $60 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had investments in The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), representing a slight decline from 43 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes amounted to over $3.13 billion.\n\nOakmark Funds funds mentioned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return approximately 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”\n\nMuch like CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the best cheap stocks to buy.\n\n14. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)\n\nShare Price as of January 27: $55.44\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nMonster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is a U.S.-based company that focuses on creating, promoting, selling, and distributing energy drink beverages and concentrates. Ranking as one of the best cheap stocks to buy, it features well-known brands such as Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn.

The analysis highlighted the robustness of the company’s core business. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, 42 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.05 billion in Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), compared to 44 in the preceding quarter worth $1.19 billion.\n\n13.

Earlier this month, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) reported its domestic sales volumes for the fourth quarter, revealing record numbers in electric vehicle (EV) sales. The company sold 25,937 EVs during the period, marking a notable 24% year-over-year growth.\n\nOn November 1, Barclays upgraded the rating of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stock to Overweight and maintained a $14 price target.

Among them, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management emerged as the largest hedge fund shareholder, owning 55.6 million shares valued at $691 million.\n\n12.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”\n\n8.

        "content": "In this article, we will be going through the major smartphone manufacturers who have introduced advanced camera phones while covering the 12highest-quality camera phones in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Highest Quality Camera Phones in 2024.\n\nAn Era of Innovation\n\nMobile upgrades are becoming increasingly influenced by camera features. This has motivated smartphone companies to include high-end camera technology in portable designs. 2024 has just begun with the launch of Galaxy S24 Ultra, the latest flagship smartphone from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF). This camera phone has inculcated AI to improve image resolution. A contender to this device is the most recent iPhone 15 series, which debuted in September 2023. While S24 Ultra includes a 200-megapixel main, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto, a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto, and 12-megapixel selfie cameras, iPhone 15 Pro Max features a 48-megapixel main, 12 megapixel ultrawide, 12 megapixels 5x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie cameras. Overall, the Galaxy S24 Ultra has an additional camera and larger dimensions than the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nThe aforementioned rivalry is rather old as the firms continue to fight for global market shares. On January 18, Reuters reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) surpassed Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) by becoming the largest smartphone seller after 12 years. While the iPhone manufacturer secured a market share of 20% by the end of 2023, its rival recorded a 19.4% share. Although Android smartphones from low-end brands such as Transsion and Xiaomi gave competition to Apple, especially in emerging markets, it ended up as the top smartphone brand around the world. Samsung couldn't tap the low-end segment while it was focusing on middle-to-high-end users. The shipments from the brand also decreased during 2023. You can also take a look at iOS vs Android market shares by country to better analyze the dynamics of the competition between Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother prominent player in the smartphone race is Alphabet Inc.'s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). In this regard, the Pixel 8 Pro is the most recent camera phone that the brand has added to its Pixel product line. Notable camera features of the model include astrophotography, motion autofocus, and dual exposure controls. The three main cameras are also designed to capture more light. The Google Pixel 9 is also expected to be released later in 2024.\n\nLeading Companies in the Smartphone Industry\n\nThe smartphone industry experiences strong rivalry among incumbents. Head-on-head comparisons are made between modern-day camera phones in terms of their features. While some of these phones allow rapidly shareable images, others enable better zooms. Some of the most valuable smartphone companies in the world include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). Let's take a look at some of the most recent technological developments these firms have undertaken.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently advanced in the emerging tech trend of spatial computing. On January 8, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported that Apple Vision Pro will be available in all company stores and online in the US, starting February 2. Pre-orders for this spatial computer began on January 19. Apple Vision Pro has a new three-dimensional user interface which has made navigation easier. Users can move their wrists to scroll and tap their fingers to select. Since the interface allows apps to be displayed without any boundary restrictions, multitasking and collaboration in workplaces will also be convenient.\n\nOn January 30, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) reported that its new Galaxy S24 series is set to tap the global market. The pre-order sales of the series experienced a double-digit rise relative to the previous model once this announcement was made. The company has also incorporated a suite of AI-powered camera tools to enable an improved experience with capturing and editing pictures. Galaxy S24 Ultra, Galaxy S24+, and Galaxy S24 will be widely available from January 31.\n\nSony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is a Japanese conglomerate corporation that sells diverse products including cameras, smartphones and other consumer electronics, and films. Amidst a digital era, the company has been investing in the latest technologies to facilitate its customers.  On January 9, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) reported that it will be supporting 3D content creators through the development of an immersive spatial content creation system. The system includes an XR head-mounted display and a pair of controllers. The launch of the system is expected in the latter part of 2024. Users can efficiently render the textures of 3D objects using the system.\n\nNow that we have taken a look at the major players in the smartphone industry that are contributing to the adoption of camera phones, let’s move to the 12 highest-quality camera phones in 2024.\n\n12 Highest Quality Camera Phones in 2024\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 12 highest-quality camera phones in 2024, we conducted a consensus. Initially, we gathered a list of the highest quality camera phones listed on multiple online vendors such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. We sourced the rating and the number of reviews from the sources for each of the camera phones in our list.\n\nMoving forward, we chose average rating as our primary metric and cumulative number of reviews as our secondary metric. The average rating was calculated by averaging the individual ratings across the sources. Simultaneously, cumulative reviews were found by summing up the individual review count for each camera phone. Hence, the 12 highest-quality camera phones in 2024 were ranked according to their average rating and number of reviews, on a priority basis.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using different consensus approaches, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n12 Highest Quality Camera Phones in 2024\n\n12.

        "title": "Big Tech earnings are here. Fasten your seat belts.",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported better-than-expected earnings after the bell on Tuesday, but those results weren’t enough for Wall Street, as shares of both companies fell during trading Wednesday.\n\nAnd with Apple and Meta set to report their earnings on Thursday, the pressure is on for the duo to blow away analysts’ expectations if they hope their respective stocks will avoid the same fate.\n\nFor Microsoft, the news was a boon for its artificial intelligence efforts, which the company said contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth to its Azure cloud business. But Wall Street was less than enthusiastic about those results, sending shares lower by more than 1% on Wednesday and dropping the company’s market capitalization below $3 trillion. This is despite the fact that Microsoft topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, faced a harsher reckoning, with shares falling more than 6% on Wednesday. Alphabet took a gut shot after missing expectations for advertising revenue, though it did beat on the top and bottom lines and saw growth in its cloud business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at an event at the Chatham House think tank in London, Monday, Jan. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFor Microsoft, the results seemingly show that Wall Street wants the company to squeeze more revenue out of its multibillion-dollar investments in generative AI technologies. For Alphabet, the market’s reaction points to a need to balance ad revenue growth with its deeper push into the cloud market.\n\nTwo other interesting points from the announcements: Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts on the company’s earnings call that Alphabet’s subscription services, like YouTube TV, Google One, etc., are now a $15 billion per year business. That’s up some five times since 2019.\n\nThe other surprising news came from Microsoft reporting that its gaming division, which now includes Activision Blizzard, is officially its third largest business. The group earned $7.1 billion, ahead of Windows, which took in $5.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple and Meta on deck\n\nMicrosoft and Google’s earnings may have come and gone, but the Big Tech parade keeps on moving, with Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) set to report their earnings on Thursday.\n\nApple’s announcement will help set the stage for 2024, giving Wall Street its first look at full-quarter iPhone 15 sales. Meta, meanwhile, will need to show analysts that its advertising business is continuing to rebound and how it will monetize its massive generative AI investments.\n\nApple’s Q1 earnings are easily its most anticipated in some time. Earlier this month, analysts at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple’s stock on concerns over iPhone sales in China. And on Tuesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released a report on Medium saying that he expects iPhone shipments to decline 15% year over year in 2024. Customers are selecting and buying Apple products at an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 29, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nKuo cited a resurgent Huawei as well as consumer interest in foldable and generative AI-powered phones as reasons for the potential slowdown in China.\n\nShares of Apple were down roughly 2% year to date on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThat early downward trend has cost Apple its spot as the richest publicly traded company by market capitalization. As of Tuesday, the company’s market cap topped out at $2.91 trillion, below new leader Microsoft’s $3.04 trillion market cap.\n\nApple is also in the midst of making major revisions to its App Store in Europe, as it seeks to comply with the EU’s new Digital Markets Act. The moves mean that Apple will open up devices to third-party app stores and cloud gaming services, including Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming.\n\nBut critics, including Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, say the changes are insufficient. In particular, they point to a new 0.50 euro Core Technology fee Apple will charge developers. The charge kicks in after developers record more than 1 million downloads in 12 months and will apply to each subsequent download. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nApple is also gearing up for the launch of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset on Feb. 2. The device, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is the first new product category from the company in nearly a decade, and could provide the company with a powerful new revenue stream. But that’s only if customers can get past the $3,499 price tag.\n\nThe company will need a strong performance in the quarter to justify its stock market performance of late. Shares of Meta are up 33% over the last three months and 164% over the last 12 months. That’s better than the stock performance of Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon over the same period.\n\nMeta is riding high on a rebound in its all-important advertising business after it was kneecapped by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature and a steep decline in the digital ad market thanks to dizzying interest rates.\n\nBut Meta is still hemorrhaging money from its Reality Labs division, which is responsible for its metaverse work and Quest headsets. In Q3, the company reported the segment lost $3.7 billion in Q3 2023 alone. But with Apple’s headset coming shortly, Meta could see a knock-on effect for Quest headset sales.\n\nWe’ll see how this all shakes out come Thursday.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is worth keeping tabs on if you’re a relatively new value investor who’s still learning the ropes in the investing world. Indeed, the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is full of what Buffett would label a “wonderful company.” There are major (or even minor) holdings in the portfolio. But that doesn’t mean you should be a net buyer of any individual holdings. After all, the price you pay will differ from the price Berkshire paid.\n\nIndeed, with the Berkshire portfolio, we’ve got the “wonderful” factor down. But what about pricing? After a hot January, prices are getting a tad rich, depending on where you look. Still, I view compelling value within the Berkshire portfolio right here.\n\nThough you may not land the same cost basis as Buffet, the Berkshire portfolio as an excellent guide for beginners. And right now, the following three are among the most intriguing as we move into February.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the long-time holdings of the legendary Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. There’s a slim chance of scoring a cost basis anywhere close to what Berkshire paid. I view shares as reasonably priced compared to what you’re getting. American Express isn’t just a wonderful company. It’s one that’s become more wonderful with time. The company’s latest quarter sent AXP stock skyrocketing, up more than 7% in a day as investors digested the results.\n\nAnd, the results weren’t just good. They were incredibly impressive, with traction gaining with younger consumers (think Millennials and even Zoomers). Indeed, this isn’t the first quarter that saw young people in the growth driver’s seat. And it probably won’t be the last as American Express does its best to cater to the younger generations, which only stand to become wealthier over the years and decades.\n\nYoung people are loving the Platinum and Gold cards, the flexible Amex points, and the travel-focused nature of the American Express ecosystem. In many ways, American Express is the ultimate credit card stock to own right now. And, it’s perhaps the most intriguing of the Berkshire batch while it’s going for just 18.2 times trailing price-to-earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest holding of the Berkshire portfolio. It stands to comprise a larger slice of the pie over time as the company continues buying back shares while growing earnings steadily over time.\n\nUndoubtedly, iPhone sales are bound to be lumpy over the medium term, with some years’ models shining brighter than others. You could argue that the latest iPhone 15 model isn’t all too different from last year’s. This is a common complaint of smartphone users these days. Still, if you’re a long-term investor like Buffett, the year-over-year (YOY) lumpiness of hardware sales growth ought to be forgiven.\n\nAt the end of the day, the services segment continues growing. And, it’s making the overall revenue growth mix somewhat look less lumpy over time.\n\nFurther, the world economy isn’t exactly in an ideal place right now. In the U.S. and Canada, consumers face headwinds that could keep hurting their ability to upgrade to the latest tech. And in China, things couldn’t be more bleak, with the economy in dire need of some sort of relief.\n\nAs the world economy recovers in time, we could see iPhone sales pick up again, all while services continue trending higher. Who knows? Perhaps an artificial intelligence service could help really take services to the next level!\n\nEither way, I believe Apple stock remains one of the finest holdings in Berkshire’s portfolio, even at close to $190 per share.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW IPO)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) represents a snowflake-sized portion of the Berkshire portfolio. But it’s still a high-tech innovator worth keeping on a watchlist.\n\nAs a hyper-growth company with a booming cloud data business, Snowflake is unlike any other holding in Berkshire’s portfolio. Indeed, it’s a stark deviation from the typical Berkshire and Buffett playbook. However, I do view the holding as one that could grow in the future as Buffett’s successors gain more influence over the Berkshire portfolio.\n\nAt $206 and change per share, Snowflake stock is looking lofty again, even for the most seasoned of growth investors. At over 26 times price-to-sales (P/S), SNOW seems too expensive to consider.\n\nEven still, the company has a lot to win as the AI revolution continues to unfold. As one of the most intriguing data infrastructure plays out, investors should be willing to give the name a second look after its recent 9.1% year-to-date (YTD) surge.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple, American Express, Berkshire Hathaway, and Snowflake.

        "content": "While technology stocks continue to drive the market higher, they are not the only game in town. Investors needn’t invest only in semiconductor stocks to achieve big gains. Many blue-chip stocks are rallying right now following the release of their financial results for the fourth and final quarter of 2023.\n\nThe names of a lot of these worthwhile stocks will be familiar to investors. And for good reason. They tend to be dominant companies and brands that provide goods and services many of us find essential in our lives. Profitable, flush with cash and with a strong growth trajectory, these blue-chip stocks make for solid long-term investments. They can easily form the foundation of any portfolio, and investors can expect consistent returns from them. Here are the seven best blue-chip stocks to invest in for big gains in 2024.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Visa (NYSE:V) is trending upwards after the credit card giant issued fourth quarter 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts. The company, which operates the world’s biggest payments network, reported Q4 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.41, topping analyst estimates of $2.34. Revenue amounted to $8.60 billion, up more than 9% from a year earlier and ahead of forecasts that called for $8.50 billion in sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn terms of forward guidance, Visa said that it expects revenue growth in the current first quarter of 2024 in the upper-mid to high-single digits and profit growth in the high-teens. The payments company continues to benefit from strong consumer spending and retail sales. Its payment volumes, which cover the holiday shopping season, rose 8% in Q4 2023, while cross-border volumes increased 16%. The company’s total transactions for Q4 2023 rose 9% to $57.50 billion.\n\nV stock is up 7% so far in 2024 and has gained 21% in the last 12 months.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is on a tear currently and has achieved an important milestone. For the first time ever, Microsoft’s market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable publicly traded company and becoming only the second concern in history to achieve a $3 trillion market cap, besting rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the process. On Jan. 25, MSFT stock finished trading with a market valuation of $3.009 trillion, slightly ahead of Apple at $3.002 trillion.\n\nThe $3 trillion milestone comes four years after Microsoft first reached a $1 trillion market cap, back in April 2019. Microsoft has been a publicly traded company since 1986. The company’s market value reached $2 trillion in June 2021, and has now topped $3 trillion. The new milestone was reached as MSFT stock has gained 11% so far in 2024, bringing its 12-month increase to 69%. The company’s stock continues to rally higher on investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flights\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter four bruising years, airline stocks look to be making a comeback, led by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). The stock of the world’s largest airline is up 9% year to date, driven higher after the carrier announced better-than-expected Q4 2023 financial results and offered a bullish outlook for the year ahead. American Airlines posted Q4 EPS of 29 cents on revenue of $13.10 billion. Wall Street had expected a profit of 11 cents on sales of $13 billion.\n\nWhile the Q4 numbers were impressive, so too was the guidance issued by American Airlines. The company said that it expects to report earnings of $2.25 to $3.25 a share for all of 2024. Analysts who were polled by FactSet expected full-year earnings of $2.14 a share. The airline said that it continues to benefit from strength in air travel coming out of the pandemic, including record bookings over the recent year-end holidays.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nThe share price of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is up 5% early in the year as the consumer-goods company continues to demonstrate that it has pricing power and consumer loyalty on its side. Procter & Gamble, whose products include Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razor blades, reported Q4 2023 EPS of $1.84 versus $1.70 that had been forecast among analysts. Revenue totaled $21.44 billion versus $21.48 billion that had been expected. The company’s sales increased 3% from a year earlier.\n\nIn terms of guidance, Procter & Gamble said it anticipates fiscal 2024 earnings growth of 1%, down from a previous forecast of 6%. However, the company’s guidance tends to be conservative. Plus, Procter and Gamble expects its results to be impacted by a $1.3 billion charge related to a drop in the book value of its Gillette razor blade business as volume growth slows due to hybrid work trends. Still, PG stock is up 11% in the past year, making it a a good blue-chip stock to invest in.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nShares of IBM (NYSE:IBM) are red hot to start the year. The technology company’s stock has gained 16% in the month of January, bringing its 12 month increase to nearly 40%. The catalyst for the move higher was a strong Q4 financial print that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. IBM reported EPS of $3.87 versus $3.78 that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue for the October through December quarter totaled $17.38 billion compared to $17.30 billion that had been forecast on Wall Street.\n\nA deeper dive into the numbers, and IBM’s results look even better. Free cash flow for all of 2023 totaled $11.20 billion, more than the $10.50 billion that management had guided for. And the company’s Q4 gross margin of 59.1% was the highest since 1999. Perhaps best of all, the company said that its business related to generative AI was double the size it was in Q3 of last year. Looking ahead, IBM said that it expects $12 billion in free cash flow and revenue growth in the mid-single digits for 2024.\n\nCharles Schwab (SCHW)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBank stocks continue to struggle. However, a growing number of analysts are lending their support. Recently, analysts at Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) issued a note to clients arguing that stocks of banks and other financial services firms are “significantly undervalued,” ready to rebound, and that it’s time to buy. Among the stocks of financial institutions, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) looks particularly cheap with its share price down 15% in the last year and currently trading at 25 times future earnings estimates.\n\nIn January, Charles Schwab reported Q4 earnings that bested Wall Street forecasts even though its revenue and profits declined from a year earlier. The financial services firm announced Q4 EPS of 68 cents, which was ahead of consensus estimates that called for 64 cents. Revenue in the final quarter of 2023 totaled $4.45 billion, matching forecasts. Charles Schwab has struggled as high interest rates prompt customers to move money out of low-yielding accounts and into better paying money-market funds.\n\nHowever, with inflation declining and interest rates on the cusp of being lowered, the year ahead should be kinder to SCHW stock.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical companies have had a difficult time over the past year. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), for one, has endured a rough road, particularly as it hived off its consumer health unit into a new company called Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE), the biggest change in the company’s 138-year history. In the last 12 months, JNJ stock has slumped 2%. In 2024, the shares are essentially flat. However, there are indications that better days are ahead for this stalwart blue-chip stock.\n\nRecently, Johnson & Johnson issued better-than-expected Q4 earnings due largely to strong sales in its medical device business unit. The company announced EPS of $2.29 versus $2.28 that had been forecast on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $21.40 billion versus $21.01 billion that had been expected among analysts. Johnson & Johnson said the strong results were due largely to a 13.3% year-over-year increase in sales of its medical devices, which generated revenue of $7.67 billion in Q4. The company also continues to take steps to resolve accusations that its baby powder caused cancer in some people.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and AAPL.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.\n\nCharles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:\n\n''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,\" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.\n\nIn 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nCharles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy\n\nSkylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to \"extrapolate\" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who \"can anticipate change before it is obvious.\"\n\nValue or Growth?\n\nCharles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.\n\n\"It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,\" the fund's website says. Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Skylands Capital's Q3'2023 portfolio and picked its top ten technology stock picks. Why do we pay attention to what hedge funds are doing? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,318,380\n\nSkylands Capital bought a new stake in entertainment and games company Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund's stake in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was valued at $1.3 million as of the end of September 2023.\n\nIn December, Jefferies said it believes the gaming industry will see a slowdown in 2024 as gamers become more selective and prudent with their purchases. Jefferies said at the time that even though Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was expected to post 2025 guidance below expectations, its upcoming games like Battlefield, Sims, Skate and new Star Wars titles will \"re-accelerate topline and drive margin expansion.\"\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA).\n\n9. Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,406,860\n\nIndustrial technology company Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) ranks ninth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital owns a $1.41 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). Over the past one year the stock has gained about 50% in value.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 23 hedge funds had stakes in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) during this period was Chuck Royce's Royce & Associates which owns a $49 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT).\n\nLike Vontier, hedge funds are also investing in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\n8. Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,433,715\n\nSatellite technology company Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) ranks eighth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, owns a $2.4 million stake in Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM). Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a new stock pick of the hedge fund.\n\nIn November, Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) CEO Matthew J Desch bought 28,000 shares of Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) at $37.01 per share.\n\nBaron Growth Fund made the following comment about Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium’s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company’s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium’s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company’s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.”\n\n7. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,612,316\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top tech stock picks of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet since his hedge fund Skylands Capital has a $2.6 million stake in the ecommerce retailer which is also a part of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that have gained a lot amid the AI boom.\n\nUBS recently published a list of quality stocks it believes could outperform in 2024. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was part of the list. UBS said in its note that these Buy-rated stocks are in \"30% top for quality, have positive earnings momentum, are not crowded -- have a crowding data score better than 0.1 -- and have reasonable value without overly high beta.\"\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the most popular technology stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 286 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”\n\n6. SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $4,148,033\n\nSaaS company SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) ranks sixth in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Charles Paquelet. Skylands Capital had a $4.1 million stake in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nEarlier this month, Citi published its Thematic Equity Strategy report in which it named its top picks in major themes. SS&C was its top stock pick in the fintech theme.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC). The biggest stakeholder of SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) during this period was Richard S. Pzena's Pzena Investment Management which owns a $748 million stake in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC).\n\nIn addition to SSNC, Skylands Capital is also invested in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our bottom contributors in Q3 were all from our long book, including HCA Healthcare and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC). SS&C Technologies, a provider of software and services to investment firms, brokerages and other financial institutions, has faced slower organic growth in recent quarters as its business units have produced inconsistent results. Further, rising costs have crimped margins — issues we believe will eventually stabilize but which we are monitoring closely. However, we believe the market is overly pessimistic about the company’s ability to improve its organic growth rate and its margins and are maintaining our position.”\n\nClick to continue reading and seeHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years 10 Best Long-Term Tech Stocks To Buy 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer is Bullish on These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nThese days, Jim Cramer is continuously talking about the broader market rotation out of AI and mega-cap tech towards stocks with lower valuation multiples. In his latest program, Cramer said that stocks from bank, steel and auto sectors are getting a lot of attention from the Wall Street. Cramer said in this environment he would buy stocks like General Motors that is trading four times earnings. Cramer said \"to raise the money\" to invest in undervalued stocks like GM, \"I will sell shares that trade 40 times earnings.\"\n\n\"Charnel House\" of Tech Stocks?\n\nCramer said that the money going into undervalued stocks cannot be \"enticed\" into \"what looks like a charnel house\" of tech stocks. Cramer also mentioned Wells Fargo and said investors in this environment would prefer to buy Wells Fargo which trades at lower multiples and also offers dividends instead of buying software stocks with higher earnings multiples or no earnings at all.\n\nJim Cramer also said that looking at some technical charts shows him that tech stocks are headed for major \"reversals.\"\n\nJim Cramer advised investors to practice patience in this environment and said it would be wise to process all the information as it comes before making any decisions.\n\nDespite constantly talking about this market rotation, Cramer also talks about how he's not worried about the lack of market breadth and concentration of market returns in tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). He recently said that his Charitable Trust owns the \"super six\" stocks (all Mag. 7 stocks minus Tesla) and there's a reason why all market gains were coming from tech stocks. Cramer said major tech companies make products and services for the Enterprise which has \"a lot of money\" to spend.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer is Bullish on These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 stocks Cramer is bullish on and recommended investors to buy. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nIn a latest program Jim Cramer was asked about Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) as the questioner said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is everywhere because of its digital images. Cramer initially appeared reluctant as he said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) went public via SPAC and if it hadn’t been a SPAC he'd be more excited about the stock. But Cramer at the end said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is a Buy.\n\n\"At five bucks I would actually own that stock. It is all over the place.\"\n\nGetty Images talked about how it's using generative AI in its business during its Q3 earnings call:\n\n\"In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images’ best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people.\n\nIt also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively. We are rewarding our contributors with an ongoing share of each and every dollar we earn from the service.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n9.

Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG).

Both stocks surged with higher US electricity prices as strong summer demand exposed reliability issues in many regions of the nation’s electric grid. Meanwhile, Midwest focused Constellation is the biggest producer of carbon-free electricity in the US with nuclear power plants representing the majority of its capacity. We added the name in January 2023 when the stock was trading at a below normal 15 times earnings. Our research identified an upside to earnings power from maturing hedges and regulatory changes, including the Inflation Reduction Act’s nuclear credit. A recent spinout from Exelon Corp, we viewed the strength of Constellation’s clean, reliable baseload power model as an appealing and high potential offering for residential and commercial customers. The company’s recent contract to supply Microsoft at premium power prices is evidence of the opportunity. Constellation is yet another example of an industry undergoing tremendous change that can offer attractive investment opportunities for investors with patience and a research process to uncover specific companies that are well positioned.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 12 Recent Additions Jim Cramer Says Recession Is Not Coming and Recommends These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Why Microsoft, Google, and AMD's stocks are getting hit after big quarters",
        "content": "When you are a stock priced for greatness but only deliver a super good earnings report...sometimes investors will get in a huff.\n\nSuch is the case with the initial crop of earnings from tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). The three stocks (with a combined market cap of $5.2 trillion) were instrumental in powering the broader market to records over the past year, but are getting dinged after reporting earnings late Tuesday.\n\nThe moves are \"signaling some overextension of the recent strong rally,\" said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance.\n\nAt first glance, the negative moves in the stock prices would seem counterintuitive to the average investor who have ridden these tech giants to massive paper gains.\n\nBut here is the deal, as President Biden would put it.\n\nThat average investor probably read the earnings releases of these bellwether companies last night. I’ll say a good percentage of them listened to the earnings calls (which you should be doing!).\n\nBy 7:00pm last night, with a full page of notes, many investors still can’t figure out why these stocks are being swept into downdrafts.\n\nAll three companies showed impressive growth numbers (especially AMD, with data center sales up 38% year over year and a 75% hike to 2024 AI chip sales estimates), hyped the AI train again (a surefire ticket for stock gains last year), and didn’t sound serious alarm bells on the economy.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nThe reality is that none of these quarters were perfect, versus investor expectations of perfection. And believe me, investors have priced in perfection to these stocks: according to Yahoo Finance data, these three stocks trade on an average forward P/E multiple of 35 times. The S&P 500 trades at 22 times, for perspective.\n\nThe vibe coming off these earnings, according to sources, is that growth is good because of the expansion of new AI tools and other businesses, but not mind-blowingly good.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s results unearthed some caution on the economy, pros say.\n\n\"While Microsoft’s F2Q24 top-line results for the two most important businesses (Azure and Office 365 Commercial) were in line to a little better than consensus expectations (and guidance), they were a bit below what our Plausible scenario anticipated, indicating slightly moderating business momentum,\" Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci wrote in a note to clients. FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is seen on the Google house at CES 2024, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 10, 2024. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nGoogle missed estimates for its ad revenue (from Search and Youtube), and its cloud business didn't light it up versus larger rival in Microsoft's Azure.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill noted on Alphabet: \"Strong ad demand drove accelerating, double-digit growth in Search and YouTube, though shy of some investor bogeys. Cloud growth re-accelerated, but remains below Azure.\"\n\nAs for AMD, its gaming chip sales fell 17% from the year prior, and guidance didn't wow the investing masses.\n\n\"This knee-jerk reaction [to tech results] is noise, the AI revolution has started,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me via email.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nBut all in, Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and other members of the Magnificent 7 will have to do better than Microsoft, AMD, and Alphabet to impress investors demanding excellence paired with a side of perfection.\n\nIf they don't, 2024 may go down as the year of the Unmagnificent 7.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 31, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Visa Inc. V, Novo Nordisk A/S NVO, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP and CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Apple, Visa and Novo Nordisk\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Visa Inc. and Novo Nordisk A/S. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple's shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+33.6% vs. +33.0%). The company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone's year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nRevenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023's reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.\r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+19.8% vs. +15.6%). The company's stock prices are driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.\r\n\r\nFueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, it is witnessing bottomline growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\r\n\r\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +22.8%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the diabetes market.\r\n\r\nObesity drug Wegovy has been enjoying increasing demand. Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view due to higher demand for Ozempic and Wegovy.\r\n\r\nIts diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging. To tackle the supply constraints of Wegovy in international markets, Novo recently announced initiating a €2.1 billion project to expand its current manufacturing facility in Chartres, France. Despite intense rivalry in the obesity care market, Novo Nordisk has been maintaining its market share.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include PepsiCo, Inc. and CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc..\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "Should You Buy Apple (AAPL) Ahead of Earnings?",
        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Apple Inc. AAPL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.13 per share for AAPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.96% heading into earnings season.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\r\n\r\nGiven that AAPL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Apple, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "It's not been a particularly great month for Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shareholders. Worried about lagging iPhone sales, the stock was downgraded by Barclays at the very beginning of the year, and then downgraded again by Piper Sandler just a couple of days later.\n\nThe shares bounced back a bit from their early January stumble, but they're weakening again now. Indeed, it's been a lackluster past few months for shareholders with the stock sliding back to where it was priced in July of last year. Maybe the company's age and sheer size is finally catching up with it.\n\nOr maybe not. Here's a rundown of reasons you might want to use the current lull to load up on Apple stock for the long haul.\n\n1. Apple stock is down for all the wrong reasons\n\nAs Barclays analyst Tim Long explains of his firm's downgrade, \"We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads, and wearables.\" Piper Sandler's worry is more broad-based. Analyst Harsh Kumar notes, \"We believe that first-half 2024 will be challenging for the analog market, handset, and consumer end markets.\"\n\nIn both cases, so-so demand for the iPhone 15 now portends so-so prospects for the iPhone 16 likely to debut later this year. And it's not like the worry is an unreasonable one; the analysts' points are well taken.\n\nIn both cases, however, the concerns look past a key quirky point about the iPhone. That is, demand for the device ebbs and flows not so much with the calendar or the economy, but with the device's longevity and capability. Some observers suggest many consumers may be holding out for the iPhone 16, which is widely expected to boast more memory, a better processor, and a superior camera.\n\nIn this same vein, Morgan Stanley analysts noted last year that there's incredible \"pent-up demand from consumers deferring their iPhone purchase from FY23 [ended in September].\" Morgan Stanley's number-crunching further suggests the iPhone's replacement cycle now stands at a record-breaking 4.4 years, meaning many iPhone fans simply can't wait much longer to upgrade their device.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, Apple's iPhone sales could be pleasantly surprising come late 2024. And for what it's worth, even the demand for Apple's iPhone 15 may be better than some of the recent rhetoric suggests. Technology market research outfit IDC reported that after the stock's two big downgrades, fourth-quarter shipments of iPhones jumped to a two-year high of 80.5 million. Data source: IDC. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\n\nPerhaps Morgan Stanley's argument for pent-up iPhone demand holds more water than it's getting credit for today.\n\n2. It's cash-rich with modest debt\n\nIt might be growth-challenged right now, but there's no company better equipped to shrug off the impact of such a headwind.\n\nAs a reminder, Apple isn't just the world's biggest company, sporting a market capitalization of just under $3 trillion. It's also still the world's most profitable company. It turned last fiscal year's revenue of $383 billion into net income of $97 billion, more or less mirroring the prior year's results. That's huge. It's also got a little over $60 billion worth of cash or highly liquid cash-like holdings on its books.\n\nBut what about debt? It's sitting on just a little less than $100 billion in long-term debt, and another $49 billion in other long-term liabilities. That's also huge -- by other company's standards. For a business of Apple's size and caliber, however, it's enviable. This mega-company's balance sheet and reliable income stream mean it's not forced to make short-term decisions just to survive, only to create bigger problems down the road.\n\nSaid another way, access to current and future cash flow provides Apple with a strategic advantage many of its competitors simply don't have right now.\n\n3. Apple's business model -- and mindset -- is evolving\n\nThe third reason to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow? It's a bit philosophical, but evident when you make a point of looking for it. That is, the company's business model is evolving from one merely focused on devices to a cultural, solutions-oriented one.\n\nThis idea isn't readily evident with just a superficial glance. The iPhone still accounts for a little over half of the company's revenue, after all. Dig deeper, though. Apple's doing things to expand its digital ecosystem that drives a combination of hardware and software sales.\n\nYes, the growth of its services arm is an example of this shift. While digital goods and services may only account for about 20% of its total top line, profit margins for this business are about three times wider than they are on sales of physical products. This is only a sampling of the paradigm shift underway, however.\n\nConsumer-oriented cloud storage, high-performance video gaming, the continued development of its virtual reality tech called Apple Vision (despite any apparent meaningful demand for it), ongoing tinkering with artificial intelligence, and even semi-autonomous vehicles are all projects still on Apple's plate, even when they don't have to be.\n\nThis degree of speculative R&D is relatively new for Apple. Perhaps without even fully knowing how or when these efforts might pay off, the company is positioning itself to be an important technology player in an ever-changing future.\n\n4. The most important reason is still the most important reason\n\nThe fourth and final reason to step into new stakes in Apple stock right now, however, isn't a new one at all. That is, this is still Apple. Its brand and name remain among the world's best-known -- and for good reason. It's fostered incredible loyalty to its products and services by building superior products and delivering superior service. Its tech just works.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean the stock's immune to an occasional bout of weakness. It's gone nowhere for the past six months, as a reminder, and was recently on the receiving end of a couple of key analyst downgrades -- analysts who were concerned about its near-term numbers.\n\nThis isn't the sort of stuff long-term investors should sweat too much, though. True long-termers should aim to own stakes in quality companies, using near-term weakness in their underlying stocks to establish those positions. And Apple at its worst is still better than many companies at their best.\n\nIn other words, now's your chance to get into a great pick at a bit of a discount.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Gen Digital (GEN) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "Gen Digital GEN is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. Gen Digital was formerly known as NortonLifeLock Inc. and was trading under the NLOK ticker symbol.\n\nNortonLifeLock changed its name and ticker symbol, effective from Nov 8, 2022, following the completed merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast Plc. The newly named company unites trusted consumer safety brands, including Norton, Avast, LifeLock, AVG, Avira, CCleaner and ReputationDefender.\n\nThe company projects quarterly revenues between $950 million and $960 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $955.8 million, indicating a 2.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $936 million.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Gen Digital expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 49 cents-51 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 50 cents per share, indicating an 11.1% higher than the year-ago reported figure of 45 cents.\n\nThe company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while matching on one occasion, the average surprise being 4.1%.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.\n\nGen Digital Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nGen Digital Inc. price-eps-surprise | Gen Digital Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nGEN’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the increased demand for cybersecurity and ID analytics solutions in the hybrid work environment. Over the past couple of years, as more people are shifting online, the need for online privacy has been rising. Global workforces working remotely are logging into employers' networks, escalating the need for digital security. This trend is likely to have spurred the demand for Gen Digital’s security products in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nOur third-quarter estimate for Gen Digital’s Consumer Security segment’s revenues is pegged at $611.7 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 3.7%. Our estimate of $330 million for the Identity and Information Protection division implies growth of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nGen Digital’s third-quarter top line is also likely to have been primarily driven by the inclusion of the Avast business, which significantly increased the combined company’s Average Direct Customer count. Our third-quarter estimate for this key metric is pegged at 38.4 million.\n\nMoreover, the expansion of product offerings following the merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast is likely to have facilitated the newly formed company to cross-sell products to each other’s customers, thereby aiding Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) growth. Gen Digital’s ARPU increased by 30 cents to $7.28 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from $6.98 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nWe anticipate the trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Our third-quarter fiscal 2024 estimate for ARPU is pegged at $7.32, which is 23 cents higher than the third-quarter fiscal 2023 level.\n\nAn expansion in the EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions is also likely to have been an upside for GEN this season. Further, the growing number of client bookings, supported by their retention and renewal rates, is anticipated to have contributed to the company’s fiscal third-quarter top line. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Gen Digital’s client retention rate was 77%, while bookings grew 28% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe Norton and Avast antivirus maker’s sustained focus on growing partner channels and employee benefit programs is likely to have driven its performance in the quarter to be reported. Our estimate for the company’s Partner revenues is pegged at $98.4 million, which calls for a 3.5% increase from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, Direct Customer revenues are expected to increase 3.1% year over year to $843.4 million, per our estimate.\n\nHowever, GEN’s overall third-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Additionally, increased interest expenses due to enhanced debt related to Avast acquisition financing are likely to have weighed on the bottom line. Moreover, the company’s earnings per share are expected to have been negatively impacted by the equity dilution impact of the Avast acquisition. To finance the acquisition of Avast, Gen Digital issued 94 million new shares.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Gen Digital this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nThough GEN currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, Fabrinet FN, Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nFabrinet carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.13%. The company is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 5. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 3.4%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fabrinet’s second-quarter earnings stands at $2.04 per share, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.4%. It is estimated to report revenues of $699.8 million, which suggests an increase of approximately 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.96% at present. Apple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 3.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.09 per share, suggesting an increase of 11.2% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.88. Apple’s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve marginally to $117.62 billion from $117.15 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMeta carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.79%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 1. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 27.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.83 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 61%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $38.93 billion, calling for a year-over-year rise of 21%.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple set for modest iPhone sales growth, China worries remain",
        "content": "By Yuvraj Malik\n\n(Reuters) - Apple iPhone sales likely rose 3% in the key holiday period, the best growth in five quarters, but analysts expect a tough year for the company in China, where it faces regulatory headwinds and resurgent competition from Huawei.\n\nWall Street expects the company's latest flagship iPhone 15 to face stiff competition from Samsung's new Galaxy S24 packed with generative artificial intelligence features and a Huawei phone powered by a China-made chip.\n\nGenerative AI could become central to deciding who grabs the crown of the world's biggest company this year.\n\nMicrosoft edged ahead of Apple in the past few trading sessions with a $3 trillion valuation, and analysts expect it to cement that lead soon as it sells more AI-packed products.\n\nWhile Apple shares climbed nearly 50% last year, they were still the smallest gainer among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nApple has been facing some headwinds in China, with the country's property sector grappling with problems, while officials in China have signaled that iPhones are out of favor in government offices.\n\nIPhone shipments to China fell 2% in the December quarter, according to market research firm IDC, and analysts said Android phones are making a big comeback there, helped by Huawei's popularity.\n\n\"The iPhone faces structural challenges that will lead to a significant decline in shipments in 2024, including the emergence of a new paradigm in high-end mobile phone design and the continued decline in shipments in the Chinese market,\" Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, said in a note.\n\nThe brightest spot in Apple's first-quarter results, scheduled for Thursday, is likely to be its services segment, which includes revenue from App Store, Apple TV and Apple Music.\n\nServices segment revenue likely grew 12.5% in Apple's quarter ended December, according to LSEG data.\n\nHowever, the App Store faces headwinds in Europe, where a new law will force Apple to allow developers to skip its payment systems, and paying commission to Apple, starting in March.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Apple is expected to report quarterly revenue edged up 0.7%, ending four straight quarters of decline.\n\nBut Bernstein analysts forecast iPhone sales will fall 3% in 2024, barely boosting overall revenue.\n\nApple's Vision Pro, its riskiest bet since the introduction of the iPhone more than a decade ago, went up for pre-orders in the U.S. on Jan. 19. Analysts do not expect it to be a meaningful revenue driver this year.\n\n\"Greater clarity on GenAI initiatives, a successful roll-out of the Vision Pro, and updated capital allocation policies have the potential to be catalysts for Apple over the next six months,\" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has $177 Billion Invested in These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Here's Which 1 Could Soar the Most in 2024.",
        "content": "You won't find many of the hottest growth stocks on the market in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. His approach focuses more on stocks with attractive valuations and underlying business models that are in his circle of competence.\n\nHowever, I didn't say you won't find any of these sizzling stocks among the legendary investor's holdings. Buffett has $177 billion invested in these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nBuffett's \"Magnificent Two\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven narrows down to the \"Magnificent Two\" as far as Buffett is concerned. It's also probably fair to say that he views one of those two stocks as much more magnificent than the other.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ranks as the biggest position in Berkshire's portfolio by far. The conglomerate's stake is currently worth close to $175.9 billion.\n\nOne of Berkshire's other investment managers first bought 10 million shares of Apple in May 2016. However, it didn't take long for Buffett to jump aboard the Apple train. Buying the stock turned out to be a very good move. Apple's shares have soared more than 8x since Berkshire first purchased the stock, including a gain of more than 30% over the last 12 months.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stands as the only other Magnificent Seven stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. As was the case with Apple, another Berkshire investment manager initiated the position in Amazon. Buffett acknowledged shortly after the purchase of Amazon stock in 2019 that he had \"been an idiot for not buying\" sooner. Berkshire's stake in the e-commerce and cloud services giant is currently worth around $1.6 billion.\n\nEven though Buffett was late to the party with Amazon, he's had plenty to celebrate. Over the last 12 months alone, the stock has skyrocketed nearly 60%.\n\nWhich stock could soar the most in 2024?\n\nA greater percentage of analysts have bullish takes on Amazon than do Apple. I don't always agree with the prevailing view on Wall Street, but in this case, I think that the analysts are probably right.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is a wonderful business. The stickiness of its iPhone ecosystem is truly impressive. However, investors should reasonably expect strong growth from a stock that trades at a forward earnings multiple of 29x. They're not getting it with Apple right now.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon continues to deliver tremendous earnings growth. The company's streamlining efforts are paying off. I predict that we'll see more evidence of this in the coming quarters as Amazon's profitability and free cash flow increase further.\n\nAmazon also has a clear catalyst both over the near term and the long term. The rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, generative AI, should spur more organizations to shift their IT spending to the cloud. As the leader in the cloud services market, Amazon Web Services stands to be a key beneficiary of this trend.\n\nThe U.S. economy appears to be demonstrating more resilience than many expected as well. That bodes well for Amazon's e-commerce business in 2024.\n\nBuffett's secret Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nApple and Amazon are the only Magnificent Seven stocks you'll see listed in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. However, Buffett and Berkshire do own two other members of the group.\n\nBerkshire's subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), has a separate portfolio. Like Berkshire, NEAM has a stake in Apple. It also owns shares of Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nCould either of these other Magnificent Seven stocks ever find their way into Berkshire's portfolio? I think it's possible. Buffett has expressed his admiration for Google and Microsoft in the past. The biggest obstacle, for now, is probably the valuations of the two stocks. It wouldn't be a shock, though, if Buffett (or one of his lieutenants) scooped up Alphabet and/or Microsoft in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the India Edition newsletter by Menaka Doshi – an insider's guide to the emerging economic powerhouse, and the billionaires and businesses behind its rise, delivered weekly.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s $55 Billion Pay Package Voided, Threatening World’s Biggest Fortune Byron Allen Makes $14 Billion Offer for Paramount Global Microsoft Sales Top Estimates; Cloud Growth Disappoints Some Musk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Musk Judge Says ‘Unfathomable’ Deal Made Tesla CEO Overpaid\n\nIndia is reducing import taxes on several mobile-device components to boost smartphone production, a boon for companies like Apple Inc. that are increasingly considering the country as a global manufacturing base.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s government late Tuesday announced it was lowering tariffs on components including plastic and metal mechanical parts, SIM sockets and screws. An industry group welcomed the move as a step in the right direction.\n\nModi is trying to make India an electronics manufacturing powerhouse, luring global brands such as Apple away from China. At the same time, he’s trying to build an ecosystem of domestic suppliers to ensure India grabs a larger part of the value chain instead of being just an assembly location.\n\n“This is a critical and welcome policy intervention by the government towards making mobile manufacturing competitive in India,” Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of India Cellular and Electronics Association, said in a statement. “Building scale, riding on low input tariffs is key to transforming India into a global hub for electronics manufacturing and exports.”\n\nThe lobby group, which counts Apple, its Taiwanese suppliers Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. as well as homegrown contract manufacturer Dixon Technologies India Ltd. among its members, said last month higher duties hurt India’s cost competitiveness by up to 7%.\n\nModi’s project has had some early successes, with Apple among companies that have boosted production in the country. India now accounts for more than 7% of the iPhone’s global output.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is exploring ways to reduce its reliance on China as tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to escalate. Its longtime partners, who make most of the world’s iPhones from sprawling factories in China, have added assembly lines in India at a rapid pace over the past years.\n\nLower import tariffs will make assembly more cost-effective, and could encourage manufacturers to increasingly build devices for exporting as domestic smartphone consumption slows down. India’s smartphone exports doubled in the fiscal year through March 2023 to about $11 billion.\n\n“That scale will help strengthen India’s ambition to become the factory of the world by pushing more component makers to set up local factories,” said Navkendar Singh, an analyst at tech researcher IDC.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena Elon Musk’s Neuralink Performs Its First Human Implant How to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most profitable blue chip stocks to buy. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, the outlook for 2024, and some recent and crucial developments, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Buy.\n\nWith the first month of 2024 coming to an end, the conflict in the Middle East appears to be a sore thumb in an otherwise roaring stock market and economic climate. While the Federal Reserve can take longer to reduce interest rates, as investors have likely understood during the past couple of weeks, the economy continues to grow and inflation is nowhere near the levels that were in play in late 2022. 2023 has seen a stock market compete with high interest and get some help from the economy along the way as global oil supply chains stabilized and prices at the pump dropped as a result.\n\nHowever, the war in Palestine and the resulting destabilization in the Middle East threatens a vulnerable global economy that has finally started to find some footing after 2022's oil price shocks and high interest rates aimed at culling inflation. In the Middle East, three U.S. service members were killed and dozens were injured due to an unmanned drone attack on a base in northeast Jordan. With the political temperature already high domestically, and conflict rife in Gaza, Lebanon, and Ukraine, the U.S.'s response has everyone on the edge of their seats even though the attack took place on a weekend. The Federal Reserve is also a key body to watch as the year starts, as the tone set by its officials during their January announcements will dictate how well growth and high technology sectors can grow.\n\nThe start of the year is also the time for recollection, and for some investors, the time to adjust portfolios. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite gained 24% and 43% respectively last year, allowing the passive investor following index tracking funds a nice gain to cash out on as the year ended. Now, the question on everyone's mind is whether the markets will sustain their 2023 performance or become even bolder to set new highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst these considerations, there are a multitude of stocks that an investor can choose from. The market is often divided across several categories and sectors, and one of these picks out stocks based on their market capitalization. A market cap sets the tone for a firm in the public's mind, as more valuable companies see both retail and professional investors place a higher premium on a firm's shares. This premium is mostly reflected through fortress income statements that reflect billions (if not hundreds or tens of billions) of dollars in revenue and substantial assets that assure investors that the ability of a company to remain a going concern is not threatened even during some of the most troubling economic environments.\n\nOn the flip side, other stocks such as small cap stocks often do well when the economy is growing since it provides them with the potential to expand operations and increase sales. Balancing a portfolio often requires subjective judgment, and in today's highly connected and fast paced world, a keen monitoring of local and global events to see whether markets as a whole will remain stable or not.\n\nToday, we'll take a look at some of the most profitable blue chip stocks right now. Profit is an important indicator of a stock's financial health since it measures the money that is available for growth reinvesting, retained capital, or dividends if the company is a dividend paying stock. It also shows that financial managers have managed to manage debt and expenses to ensure investor payouts, and provides an analyst comfort that a firm should be able to handle any economic or market headwinds.\n\nSome of the most profitable blue chip stocks on our list are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).

        "title": "Fed decision ahead; Microsoft, Alphabet's AI costs - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures are mixed as investors await a major Federal Reserve interest rate decision and potential commentary on future borrowing costs from the central bank. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) warn that spending on developing their artificial intelligence capabilities will be higher this year, offsetting a strong set of quarterly earnings from the tech giants. Elsewhere, Elon Musk's massive Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pay package worth nearly $56 billion is voided by a Delaware judge.\n\n1. Fed decision ahead\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely tipped to keep interest rates steady following the central bank's latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, meaning any comments from officials around the path ahead for interest rates will be in sharp focus.\n\nBorrowing costs currently stand at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in more than two decades, after the Fed embarked on an aggressive campaign of rate hikes aimed at cooling elevated U.S. inflation.\n\nRecent data has suggested that this tightening cycle may be having the desired effect. While price growth remains above the Fed's stated 2% target, it has continued to show signs of easing back down to this mark. Economic activity has also been resilient, a trend most recently evidenced by a stronger-than-projected advance reading of fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product last week.\n\nThe figures have bolstered hopes that the Fed may be able to defeat inflation without sparking a broader economic meltdown -- a scenario known as a \"soft landing.\"\n\nPolicymakers signaled in December that there could be as many as six rate reductions in 2024, fueling anticipation late last year that a twenty five basis point cut could come as early as March. Yet several Fed officials, wary of reigniting upward pressure on inflation, have since poured cold water on these expectations. Commentary today from the Fed -- and Chair Jerome Powell in particular -- could thus impact how markets see rates evolving in the coming months.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading on both sides of the flatline, as investors looked ahead to the Fed decision and gauged a fresh slate of major corporate earnings.\n\nBy 05:26 ET (10:26 GMT), the Dow futures contract had added 34 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures had dipped by 27 points or 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures had shed 224 points or 1.3%.\n\nThe Fed could finally \"put a pin in the idea\" of an imminent rate cut on Wednesday, said Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analysts at CMC Markets (LON:CMCX), in a note. \"It would be surprising if the Fed were to signal a cut in rates in March although they might well open the door to one on [the second quarter],\" Hewson added.\n\nElsewhere, shares in Microsoft and Alphabet slipped in premarket trading, with Wall Street fretting over the large costs both of the tech behemoths are set to incur in their push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence (more below). More earnings are due out today, including numbers from embattled planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO).\n\nIn the prior session, the benchmark S&P 500 closed lower by 0.1%, but was still just under its all-time high reached on Monday, while a dip in megacap names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dragged down the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite by 0.8%. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%.\n\n3. Microsoft, Alphabet flag AI costs\n\nMicrosoft and Google-owner Alphabet have flagged that they expect capital spending will rise this year as they attempt to bolster their position in the intensifying race to harness surging demand for generative AI.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft told analysts in a post-earnings call that the need to scale its AI infrastructure would cause expenditures to \"increase materially\" on a sequential basis in areas like data centers and servers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood added that Microsoft, who surpassed Apple has the world's biggest company earlier this month, is shifting to an \"AI-first position.\"\n\nAlphabet also said that spending would be \"notably larger\" in 2024, with the YouTube-parent driving to build out its AI offerings at its key advertising and cloud services units. In particular, Alphabet is targeting the launch of an advanced upgrade to its generative AI chatbot, Bard, later this year.\n\nFinance chief Ruth Porat noted that the group sees \"extraordinary\" potential for the applications of AI for users, adding that the technology offers \"long-term growth opportunities.\"\n\nBoth firms posted better-than-anticipated profit and revenues in their most recent quarters, although Wall Street's tepid reaction indicated that doubts remain over whether they can maintain the soaring spending levels needed to deliver generative AI.\n\n\"In the larger picture, the trend for this earnings season is clear: the market wants to see who has enough spending power to dominate the innovation war expected to play out as soon as monetary conditions improve,\" said Thomas Monteiro, Senior Analyst at Investing.com. \"In this case, more than actual [earnings per share], investors want to see improving margins and free cash flows so they can understand that the company will have a shot in the AI arms race.\"\n\n4. Judge tosses out Musk's massive Tesla pay package\n\nA judge in the U.S. state of Delaware has voided tech tycoon's Elon Musk's huge $55.8 billion Tesla pay package, saying that it amounted to an \"unfathomable sum\" that was not fair to shareholders.\n\nThe decision, which tosses out the biggest remuneration offering in corporate America, argued that the directors of the electric vehicle giant appeared to be beholden to Musk's \"superstar appeal.\" The case related to a lawsuit brought by some Tesla stakeholders who believed that the compensation was excessive.\n\nShould the ruling be upheld, Musk would lose options to more than 303 million Tesla shares, or roughly about 10% of the company and well below his previously stated goal of 25% ownership.\n\nShares in Tesla slipped in premarket trading on Wednesday.\n\n5. Crude dips after weak Chinese manufacturing data\n\nOil prices edged lower, as disappointing manufacturing activity data from China, the world's biggest crude importer, dented sentiment.\n\nBy 05:27 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $76.89 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 1.1% to $81.59 a barrel.\n\nOfficial data showed that manufacturing activity in China contracted for a fourth straight month in January, raising further doubts around the strength of the economic recovery of this vital crude market.\n\nThat said, the crude benchmarks are still on course for their first monthly gain since September as broadening Middle East conflicts exacerbated supply concerns over this oil-rich region.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated that crude stockpiles dropped by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 26.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at 20 countries that will pay you to move there in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to 5 Countries That Will Pay You to Move There in 2024.\n\nAccording to the Interactive World Migration Report of 2022, there has been a worldwide increase of 128 million immigrants over the past three decades— the total reached 281 million people in 2020— the year of the Global Pandemic.\n\nSpeaking of the Pandemic, it’s important to note that like all the other aspects of life that were altered and changed during that time, the travel and migration industries experienced the same. During COVID-19, the borders were temporarily shut down, immigration was put on a halt, and the global economy suffered. The World Economic Forum reports that 114 million people lost their jobs to COVID-19 and the lockdowns that followed. With changes as huge as these, naturally, the way of thinking and perspectives changed for a lot of people as well.\n\nAfter COVID, the people who (before the Pandemic) were ready to settle as full-time workers for any company as long as they had a job, became more concerned about advancing in their career and doing more. According to the Prudential Financialsurvey conducted in 2021, 80% of the participants said they would seek new opportunities to advance in their careers. In another survey, 42% of remote workers said that if their current employer does not continue to offer long-term remote work, they will seek new opportunities in a company that does. In other words, people have started prioritizing work-life balance and their careers more than they did before the Pandemic.\n\nConsequently, there is also an increase in the number of full-time freelancers, meaning more people working remotely and independently. The MBO Partners found that full-time freelancers in the US grew by 59% between 2020 and 2022. This also means that during this time, the freelance market grew at an exponential rate. According to Upwork (Nasdaq: UPWK), one of the leading freelance platforms, 68 million Americans freelanced and contributed $1.27 trillion to the US economy in 2023, which is an increase of around $300 billion compared to 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe boom in the freelancing world has also increased the number of nomads around the world. Now that the remote work lifestyle has made life more convenient, more people are looking to move to countries that fulfill their desires better. In fact, a study by MBO Partners finds that in 2023, 17.3 million American workers were describing themselves as digital nomads. Compared to 2019, there was an increase of 10 million American digital nomads by 2023.\n\nNow, many rich countries (See: 15 Richest Countries That Pay You to Move There) are competing worldwide to cash in on the digital nomad trend and bring immigrants into their country as a solution to some of their own problems, such as skill shortage, rapid aging, or population discrepancy in the country.\n\nDue to skill shortages, in most cases, private companies are the ones offering to pay for relocation to their migrant employees in countries where the national workforce is limited. Three of the most prominent examples of private companies practicing this are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE), Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE: CCI), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAll three companies are also leaders within their fields. In 2023, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) achieved a record revenue of $19.41 billion. In the same year, in December, Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) and Figma mutually ended a $20 billion merger deal as well. Meanwhile, Crown Castle Inc (NYSE: CCI) had a net revenue of $1.67 billion in 2023. In 2024, Crown Castle Inc (NYSE: CCI) expects a site rental revenue of $6.37 billion.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) achieved a revenue of $383 billion in the fiscal year 2023. While it’s the leading manufacturer of consumer electronics, it is said to be left behind its rival in developing generative artificial intelligence (AI) products. But Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) is set to invest $1 billion per year in developing AI technology, reports Bloomberg.  Similar to companies increasing the pay of their employees to create more demand and offering the opportunity for relocation, countries facing population decline or skill shortage pay people as an incentive to move to their countries. Here is a list of 20 countries that will pay you to move there in 2024.\n\nLet's now head over to the list of places that pay you to move there. 20 countries that will pay you to move there in 2024\n\n20 countries that will pay you to move there in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of 20 countries that will pay you to move there in 2024, we first gathered the list of countries whose governments pay you to move there.

Mauritius\n\nPays: $440 to aspiring entrepreneurs\n\nThe island of Mauritius is offering around $440 to start a business there. To qualify, you’ll have to have a profitable business plan. Once you submit, it’s up to the government to accept or reject the application based on their criteria. Mauritius is known for its growing economy and is a very business-friendly country. Most of their economy is based on agriculture, tourism, and financial exports. Mauritius also offers free healthcare to residents.\n\n19. Sicily, Italy\n\nPays: $5,420 or a house for 1€ to anyone looking to relocate\n\nSicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, has been shrinking in population for quite some time now. Although it is considered a part of Italy, it is geographically outside of it. Two towns on this island, Sambuca di Sicilia and Troina are selling houses to new residents for as low as €1 to bring the population back up to normal. However, you have to pay for the compulsory renovation of the house and make a deposit of $6000 as security to the state. The deposit will be refunded upon completing the renovation. Similarly, another town on the island, named Petralia Soprana, is offering $5,420 to individuals and families looking to permanently relocate to the town.\n\n18. Legrad, Croatia\n\nPays: $4,000 + ($0.16 house) to qualifying people under 40\n\nLegrad was once a populated village in Croatia, but due to urban migration, its population declined over time. So, now Croatia is offering a house in the village for just 1 Kuna, which is around $0.16. The house will most likely require a high renovation cost, but the state will chip in $4,000 to the total cost. To be eligible for this offer, you need to be under 40, financially stable, and have a degree. Also, you will be required to register residence in Legrad within 3 years.\n\n17. Italy\n\nPays: $10,000 to students and researchers\n\nThe Italian government has a program called \"Invest Your Talent\". This project is aimed more at students and researchers who wish to further their careers while living in Italy. Invest Your Talent offers $10,000 and a visa for one year for all those who are accepted. There are even some smaller towns in Italy like Candela, Molise, and Vetto that are slowly on the decline in terms of population and are looking for more people to move there.\n\n16. Japan\n\nPays: $10,000 to foreigners\n\nJapan offers a one-year visa and up to $10,000 to foreigners to move to Japan, as a part of its regional revitalization program. This is to help the country with population imbalance and to increase income in rural areas. Japan has a good business environment and plenty of growth opportunities. The government also offers extra incentives for families looking to move to rural areas in Japan.\n\n15. Austria\n\nPays: $10,000 to non-EU/EEA and non-Swiss citizens\n\nAustria is one of the countries that'll pay you if you moved there. Under its Red-White-Red Card Program, Austria offers non-EU/EEA and non-Swiss working citizens $10,000 to move there. This program includes a one-year visa along with financial support. Since Austria is a difficult country to move to, and has many job opportunities, the Red-White Card program is ideal for working people from third-world countries who wish to relocate to Austria. As the conditions apply, Austria offers this program due to a shortage of skilled workers in the country.\n\n14. England\n\nPays: £10,000 to teachers\n\nEngland, a land full of aesthetic landscapes and vibrant modern cities, has an opportunity for teachers worldwide. While England has one of the best education systems in the world, currently, it's facing a shortage of teachers. In 2022-23, the country met only 59% of its teacher recruitment targets. So, to fill in the shortage, England is offering to pay £10,000 to teachers who are planning to move there.\n\n13. USA\n\nPays: $15,000 to working and talented individuals\n\nSome cities in the US, like Rochester, New York, are paying people up to $15,000 to move there. The “move to Rochester grant” includes home buyer grants and tailored programming once you move there. To be eligible for this grant, you must have a full-time remote job, be at least 18 years of age, and be able to relocate to Rochester within six months of application acceptance. With this program, the Rochester officials hope to find top-talent individuals and offer economic opportunities to them. The main industries in Rochester are the manufacturing, health imaging, and smart energy districts.\n\n12. Canada\n\nPays: $15,000 to students\n\nCanada is offering college graduates $15,000 in tax returns to stay in the country. The only requirement is that you need a post-secondary school graduate from certain approved institutions. Those accepted to receive this incentive will continue to receive the same amount for 10 years. During this time, they’ll have to file taxes and maintain residency on their own. If a remote employee residing in Canada wants to apply, this program is eligible and is open for them too.\n\n11. Island of Sark\n\nPays: $20,000 to people looking to relocate\n\nThe Island of Sark is an island country located in the English Channel, known for its quiet and serene life. Sark has introduced the Sark Society program, which offers up to $20,000 and a year-long visa to those looking to relocate to the island. The program is open to all, but you must qualify to receive funding. With this initiative, the Island hopes to attract more residents and combat a declining population. The current population of the island stands at 562. People here are welcoming and the environment is safe. Tax policies and the business aspect of this island are particularly favorable for entrepreneurs as there are no taxes on income, capital gains, companies, inheritance, etc.\n\n10. Greece\n\nPays: $21,600 to families\n\nGreece is currently facing the crisis of a declining population and is looking for more people to live in the country so it can continue to grow and stimulate its economy. While there isn't an official country program to apply to, multiple cities in Greece offer a stipend for living there. The island of Antikythera, for example, offers a monthly payment of nearly $600 for the first three years, totaling $21,600. This is usually just offered for families as opposed to single individuals.\n\n9. Ireland\n\nPays: $50,000 to entrepreneurs and small businesses\n\nIreland offers to pay entrepreneurs and small businesses who wish to start companies in their country, putting the country on our list of countries that pay you to move there. The incentive amount for the Irish Start-Up Entrepreneur Program is $50,000, alongside a one-year visa. This is an excellent opportunity for companies in the early stages of their business— with access to the EU and its market, there is an increased opportunity for business growth.\n\n8. Spain\n\nPays: $50,000 to entrepreneurs\n\nThe government of Spain offers another program for entrepreneurs to start their businesses in their country. This includes an incentive of $50,000 and a one-year visa. Some cities even offer additional programs that pay people to move there. Typically these are offered for young couples who wish to begin a family and are even awarded additional money for each child they have. However, for some cities, applicants may have to live in the city for a set amount of time. Ponga, for example, requires that families live there for at least five years before applying for funding.\n\n7. Denmark\n\nPays: $50,000 to aspiring entrepreneurs\n\nDenmark is another country that appreciates skilled workers and is looking for entrepreneurs to move there. The government offers $50,000, support, and a one-year visa to aspiring entrepreneurs through its Startup Denmark program. The program is designed to help people start and set up new and unique businesses in the country— with a stable, growing economy and good business climate, Denmark is the ideal place for a startup.\n\n6. Portugal\n\nPays: $5,243 to working individuals and $50,000 to aspiring entrepreneurs\n\nThe Portuguese government is paying people to work in the inland regions of the country through its Emprego Interior MAIS scheme, which pays in grants up to $5,243. Portugal offers a good quality of life and work-life balance, making it a great place for remote workers. Applicants are required to stay for up to a year if approved for this scheme. There is also the startUp visa scheme which offers $50,000 for people looking to start a business in the country.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 countries that will pay you to move there.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n17 Best European Countries to Move to from the USA 25 Best Countries for Wealthy People to Move To 25 Cheapest Countries in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 countries that will pay you to move there is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Tuesday, January 30, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Visa Inc. (V) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+33.6% vs. +33.0%). The company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nRevenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023’s reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.\r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+19.8% vs. +15.6%). The company’s stock prices are driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.\r\n\r\nFueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, it is witnessing bottomline growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\r\n\r\nHowever, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +22.8%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the diabetes market.\r\n\r\nObesity drug Wegovy has been enjoying increasing demand. Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view due to higher demand for Ozempic and Wegovy.\r\n\r\nIts diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging. To tackle the supply constraints of Wegovy in international markets, Novo recently announced initiating a €2.1 billion project to expand its current manufacturing facility in Chartres, France.

        "title": "3 Must-Watch Stocks Just as Unstoppable as Nvidia",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains one of the hottest stocks in the market right now, with shares eeking out yet another 2.35% gain on Monday’s session. After Nvidia stock’s January jump, shares are flirting with 30% in year-to-date gains. That’s an impressive annual return, let alone one posted in under a month. As to when (or if) shares of the chip giant are bound to reverse course remains the top question on the minds of shareholders and those enjoying the Nvidia show from the sidelines.\n\nSome way or another, NVDA stock has found a way to keep pulling rabbits out of hats, something that could easily continue through 2024. Either way, Nvidia stock remains a dangerous stock to bet against amid its AI tailwind.\n\nThough momentum investors still have lots to love about Nvidia and its latest melt-up, I’d argue it’s worth checking in on other stocks that have already gained traction in recent weeks. Indeed, many such plays may be overheated after their respective rallies. However, each is worth keeping tabs on as we march into earnings season. Let’s check in briefly with three momentum stocks as strong as Nvidia that I’d stash in the “must-watch” category.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett’s low-tech conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B, BRK-A) has been steadily (and pretty quietly) making new highs in recent sessions. Just last week, the stock hit $385 and change after enjoying a remarkable seven-day win streak. Thanks, in part, to its huge investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Japanese companies and various other firms, Berkshire Hathaway is now a stock that has something for value and momentum investors to love.\n\nThough Berkshire hasn’t been ultra active of late, it has made intriguing moves, including buying more shares of Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA). With shares of LSXMA currently trading at just 11.6 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), it’s not hard to imagine why Buffett’s firm has picked up a few more shares. Indeed, the stock looks cheap in a market that may be getting a tad overheated.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Berkshire continues playing the long-term game, it remains one of the more value-conscious picks to make the new all-time high list. And it’s worth tuning into if you’re off-put by some of the tech scene right now.\n\nT-Mobile US (TMUS) TMUS stock\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nT-MobileUS (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock also recently hit new heights after clocking in a handful of respectable quarters last year. More recently, the firm missed earnings estimates for its fourth quarter but topped on sales. Despite the initial adverse reaction, investors now seem more forgiving, given the company’s high hopes for new customer additions in 2024.\n\nUndoubtedly, the red-hot wireless play has been flying above and beyond its peers in the telecom industry. Led higher by an impressive network (it’s one to beat) and competitive prices, T-Mobile stands out as one of the market gainers that doesn’t seem content just sitting around.\n\nT-Mobile stock’s impressive performance (shares up 134% in the last five years) versus the peer group suggests the wireless scene is transforming into a winner-takes-most sort of environment. And as our high-speed data consumption grows, it’s hard not to want to jump on the T-Mobile bandwagon as it looks to enter the industry’s newest chapter of growth.\n\nAt writing, shares trade at 23.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s not a hefty multiple to pay for an industry leader with a distinct edge and a management team that knows how to get things done.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect TMUS stock to continue doing what it does best: make higher highs.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is another low-tech stock having a breakout moment, of sorts. With shares flirting with $700 per share — one more big up day will do it — COST may very well be the next momentum stock to hog the headlines should Nvidia stock’s rally begin to falter. Either way, Costco’s management seems well-equipped to make the most of the traffic surge in its stores.\n\nMany Costco shoppers have a bulk appetite for the Kirkland Signature brand (Costco’s high-quality private label) these days, and it is not a mystery as to why. Costco does private labels far better than any other large-scale retailer, in my opinion. With Kirkland, Costco shows us that consumers don’t need to compromise on quality to save money amid hard times.\n\nAs Costco expands Kirkland (perhaps they should sell Kirkland Signature gold bars next?), Costco stands out as a momentum stock that can (and likely will) grow into its seemingly expensive trailing P/E — currently 46.73.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Berkshire Hathaway (Class B) and Apple.

        "content": "AI stocks are surging ahead with unprecedented success, building upon their stellar performance last year. Artificial intelligence firms focusing on semiconductor giants have effectively reshaped market dynamics. Moreover, China’s strategic support for more than 40 AI models has significantly bolstered this surge, marking a pivotal moment in the global adoption of AI.\n\nHowever, the anticipation surrounding AI stocks, often celebrated as market juggernauts, meets a crossroads of varied expectations as 2024 progresses. While some market watchers remain optimistic, others foresee an unmatched growth opportunity on the horizon. This divergence in market sentiment paints a complex yet fascinating landscape for AI investments.\n\nFinancially, Next Move Strategy Consulting predicts the AI market’s leap from $100 billion to a whopping $2 trillion by 2030. Amidst this, three AI stocks emerge as hidden treasures. These offer a unique blend of innovation and strategic opportunity for the savvy investor in this transformative era.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) is the architect behind AI chip optimization, wielding innovation as its key weapon. Witness their groundbreaking Purion H200 single-wafer high-current implanter, unleashed in 2022, revolutionizing premier AI chip manufacturing. This technological marvel propels their sales and earnings skyward, solidifying their worldwide leadership in ion implantation systems.\n\nMoreover, in its financial report, Axcelis announced a robust third quarter, with GAAP earnings per share hitting $1.99, surpassing forecasts by 26 cents. The company’s revenue reached an impressive $292.3 million, a 27.5% bump year-over-year, outdoing expectations by $12.06 million. This financial strength underscores Axcelis’s pivotal role in enhancing AI chip performance through its critical services.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Axcelis’s unwavering commitment to maximizing shareholder returns is evident as it infuses an extra $200 million into its share repurchase program, signaling a confident outlook. With a ‘buy’ rating from Wall Street analysts and an anticipated 25.4% upside, Axcelis is marching ahead, setting industry benchmarks.\n\nBaidu Inc (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), a Chinese tech company known for internet services and AI technology, is strategically positioning itself at the forefront of AI innovation. Baidu’s proactive steps to monetize its AI services, coupled with a ‘strong buy’ rating and a projected 53% upside potential by Wall Street analysts, underscore its robust position in AI technology.\n\nFinancially, Baidu’s recent earnings report showcases its robust performance. Non-GAAP earnings per American depositary share of $2.80, comfortably beating the $2.34 estimate, alongside a revenue increase of 3.3% year over year to $4.72 billion. This fiscal health, combined with BofA’s reiterated confidence in Baidu’s AI prospects, underscores the company’s strong market position.\n\nFurthermore, Baidu is making waves in the tech world with its strategic partnership with Samsung Electronics.

Furthermore, with a ‘strong buy’ rating from TipRanks analysts and an assigned 19.55% upside potential, TSM’s outstanding performance speaks for itself.\n\nFinancially, TSM’s fourth-quarter results tell a compelling story of success. The company’s GAAP Earnings Per American Depository Receipt exceeded estimates by $.05, reaching $1.44, while revenue surged to a stellar $19.62 billion, surpassing expectations by $50 million.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Ahead of February Earnings",
        "content": "This earnings season is particularly mixed, making the list of stocks to watch before earnings especially impactful if you’re interested in directional trades. Even if not, keeping a close watch on some major stocks ahead of their earnings date can help give you a better idea of how the overall market landscape is developing – for good or for bad.\n\nThe S&P 500 is marking all-time highs, and of the companies in the index that reported thus far, nearly 70% posted a positive EPS surprise. Great news, right?\n\nDespite individual company strengths (or analysts’ misaligned expectations), the index’s collective earnings marked a 1.4% year-over-year (YoY) decline – not a particularly bullish indicator, considering how different the sentiment was this time last year. Likewise, though many companies have yet to report, a sizeable percentage are offering negative EPS guidance as they face greater uncertainty than current index pricing indicates.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat all this means is that, increasingly, we can’t rely on a “stocks go up” theory of earnings when evaluating short-term trades. At the same time, though, some overbought individual stocks seem to be a house of cards propping up a shaky market – making bets on them a risky proposition.\n\nHere are a handful of top stocks to watch before earnings – alongside whether or not they’re worth a buy at this stage in the game.\n\nBuy: Palantir (PLTR)\n\nEarnings Date: Monday, February 5th (After Hours) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the many well-known stocks reporting in February, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is the easiest to call a Buy today. After four consecutive profitable quarters, the AI and data analytics software firm is well on its way to marking its fifth. Right now, analysts are projecting earnings roughly aligned with last quarter’s, which hit a $0.07 EPS. If the thesis bears out, that represents a 100% jump on a YoY basis, which supports the collective consensus that the company will grow 85% annually over the next five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nA major tailwind for Palantir is that it’s now eligible for S&P 500 inclusion after four consecutive profitable periods. Palantir is already larger, by market cap, than 3/5 of the current index holdings. At the same time, applied AI will likely continue propelling Palantir forward. In many cases, the AI bubble is borderline bursting – “normal” companies, i.e., those without a clear AI use case, failed to demonstrate how adopting current AI tech benefited their bottom line. That’s despite the constant usage of AI-adjacent buzzwords in marketing materials and earnings calls.\n\nBut Palantir is one of the few companies with a clear, demonstrable, and viable AI platform that existed well before the current craze. Palantir’s wide-ranging AI offerings help across unique use cases, including combat targeting, intelligence, corporate data insight, public health forecasting, and more. As investors lose enthusiasm for AI labeling stamped across every company’s face, Palantir stands out as one of the few that will weather the imminent drawdown.\n\nSell before Earnings: Chipotle (CMG)\n\nEarnings Date: Tuesday, February 6th (After Hours) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) consumer sentiment is slowly turning against Chipotle, as a cursory social media search sees scores of dissatisfied customers complaining about slow and incorrect orders, poor ingredient quality, and a general feeling that the once-hot burrito company isn’t what it used to be. This is likely due, in no small part, to increased emphasis on cost-cutting at the expense of what made Chipotle the hot stock it is today. Of course, quantifying social sentiment of this type is difficult, but a look at CMG’s fundamentals reinforces a Sell rating.\n\nFrom the outset, CMG’s basic ratios skew far too high for comfort, trading at 55x earnings and 22x book value. Likewise, it trades at 1.75x earnings growth – all of which indicates gross overvaluation in light of its relatively precarious position as a pricy fast food alternative, social sentiment aside. The company’s YoY EPS growth is strong, to be sure – nearly 40% in last year’s report, but the stat is trending downward to align itself more closely with CMG’s 10-year growth average of just 13.86%.\n\nUltimately, Chipotle is a restaurant mainstay, and the stock isn’t going anywhere soon. But its current per-share price is far too overblown to be worth investing in now, and if you’re a shareholder, I’d be concerned that just a hint of bad news could send shares tumbling faster than it takes to order a burrito bowl.\n\nBuy: McDonald’s (MCD)\n\nEarnings Date: Monday, February 5th (Pre-Market) Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.\n\nSource: Gargantiopa / Shutterstock\n\nOn the fast food flip side, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) remains a strong Buy as it prepares to be one of the first stocks reporting earnings in February. Across the board, top analysts are bullish on McDonald’s. One Wedbush analyst said that it’s “hard to see McDonald’s not ‘winning’ in any consumer environment.” At the same time, a Jefferies rating expert took to CNBC to call McDonald’s a top pick in the restaurant industry as the “best defensive and offensive play in restaurants,” with “resiliency in an uncertain or weak macro [economic climate].\n\nBut the widely enthusiastic endorsement isn’t backed up by MCD’s per-share pricing; the stock climbed just under 8% over the preceding 12 months and lost about 2% since January 1st. A tough 2022 didn’t help the cause, as McDonald’s posted an annual revenue and income decrease alongside a slim margin improvement. But, on the heels of right-sizing operations and improved economic outlook, analysts expect the company to post a 7% EPS jump and 9% revenue growth in its upcoming earnings.\n\nSell before Earnings: PayPal (PYPL)\n\nEarnings Date: Wednesday, February 7th (After Hours) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite the CEO’s plans to “shock the world,” PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) seems destined to disappoint this earnings season. In a bizarre attempt to ape Steve Jobs’ vibe, the “next big thing” in payment processing turned out to be new checkout procedures that “[replace] cumbersome password inputs with biometric alternatives like face or fingerprint recognition.” That’s right – PayPal’s revolutionary news is that it finally caught up to a range of existing applications that offer exactly that.\n\nUnsurprisingly, shares dipped slightly after the underwhelming Innovation Day proceedings, though the stock is up slightly since the month began. But it may not stay solid for long, as PayPal’s house of cards could quickly crack on just a hint of poor outcomes. PayPal’s market share domination sets it apart from the competition, to be fair. But competition is increasing, and though PayPal tends to be a top pick for computer-based payment processing, it lags significantly on mobile – where the bulk of tomorrow’s digital shoppers buy things today (see the next paragraph for specifics!).\n\nBuy: Apple (AAPL)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 1st (After Hours) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough I alluded to the company in the previous paragraph, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent pivots point to long-term strength that makes the stock a buy despite its fairly high per-share pricing. Specifically, Apple’s emphasis on services – like Apple Pay and its podcasting platform – represents a cheap, high-margin flywheel that’s already dominating some specific consumer sectors.\n\nThe top-line stats for Apple Pay alone are, frankly, astonishing. They reinforce the bull thesis for Apple while cementing PayPal’s increasing irrelevance to tomorrow’s shopping ecosystem. Apple Pay has already captured 92% of the digital wallet marketplace, processing 12.6% of all online consumer payments in 2023, with 48% of customers using the digital wallet for in-person transactions. Those stats mark a new age for Apple while signaling a death knell for PayPal’s past dominance.\n\nFrom a hardware perspective, Apple is also focusing on creating greater verticals throughout its supply chain to protect against the kind of geopolitical shock we see with increased regularity. The company’s renewed in-house component production efforts will help it cut costs while ensuring quality and, of course, protect against supply chain shocks moving forward.\n\nSell before Earnings: Alibaba Group (BABA)\n\nEarnings Date: Wednesday, February 7th (Pre-Market) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nSaying that Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is a Sell is a tough call. On one hand, the company’s per-share pricing is closer than ever to its IPO debut cost and worth just a third of its 2020 high. And, unlike many other ZIRP-era high flyers, BABA isn’t a flash in the pan.\n\nUnfortunately, pure economic risk in China puts too much pressure on this stock to make it worth buying before earnings. And, while that topic is a bit too complex to look at, other factors are pressuring BABA stock that make it worth selling before earnings.\n\nDespite its size, there’s little real moat involved in BABA’s operational model. That’s clear as a primary competitor, Piunduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) beat BABA as the top eCommerce stock in China. Both companies’ core value proposition is rock-bottom pricing. But, while BABA focused on overseas manufacturing, Piunduoduo’s China-specific emphasis lets it snag market share away. At the same time, those supply chain shocks mentioned in the last paragraph pressure BABA’s overseas shipments, and companies are increasingly looking elsewhere, like Latin America, for scaled production.\n\nSell: Affirm Holdings (AFRM)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 8th (After Hours) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nI covered the Sell thesis behind Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) last week, but it’s worth revisiting before the company posts earnings. This is also a fairly contrarian position, as the stock surged more than 185% over the past year. But I think this bubble is about to burst soon, if not after this upcoming earnings report.\n\nYou probably recognize that Affirm’s core business revolves around its buy now, pay later (BNPL) model. This model essentially provides consumers with short-term micro-loans at the point of sale. However, for better or worse, the BNPL solutions tend to attract consumers with less-than-stellar credit. With credit card delinquency rates on the rise, it seems inevitable that Affirm will face a surge in unpaid BNPL loans.\n\nAffirm’s latest financial statements reveal a significant increase in its allowance for credit losses (expected delinquency write-offs), which surged by over 10% year-over-year. This uptick occurred even before the holiday sales season when tons of consumers undoubtedly maxed out their credit cards and relied heavily on Affirm’s BNPL services. Given the current consumer and macroeconomic trends, the short-term outlook for Affirm appears bleak, positioning it as one of the top stocks to sell before earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Apple is set to announce its first quarter earnings results after the bell on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Kuo, who has accurately predicted Apple's moves in the past, a drop in iPhone sales in China coupled with the emergence of generative AI-powered and foldable smartphones will put pressure on iPhone sales throughout the year.\n\n\"Apple’s weekly shipments in China have declined by 30%–40% [year over year] in recent weeks, and this downward trend is expected to continue,\" Kuo wrote in a post on Medium. Customers are experiencing the newly launched iPhone 15 at Apple's flagship store in Shanghai, China, on Sept. 24, 2023. (Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n\"The main reason for the decline is the return of Huawei and the fact that foldable phones have gradually become the first choice for high-end users in the Chinese market.\"\n\nBarclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple’s stock in early January on concerns over iPhone sales in China. Bank of America, however, upgraded Apple's stock, citing its Vision Pro headset and generative AI as future growth catalysts.\n\nThe downward trend has also cost Apple its spot as the richest publicly traded company by market capitalization. The company is now valued at $2.9 trillion, lower than the new top dog Microsoft, which had a market cap of $3.05 trillion as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nApple is in the midst of some of its biggest changes yet, as the company prepares to make significant revisions to its App Store policies in Europe to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act. The iPhone maker says it will begin to open up European consumers' devices to third-party app stores and allow game streaming services like Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming on devices.\n\nBut critics including Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek say the changes don't go far enough in satisfying their respective antitrust concerns.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

That suggests shipments of the iPhone 15 and upcoming iPhone 16 will decline by 10% to 15%, he said.\n\nChina is a particular area of concern.

It's also available to stream on Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA).\n\nThe report added that \"Suits,\" which originally aired from 2011 to 2019, surpassed \"The Office\" to become the most-streamed title ever. \"The Office\" generated 57.1 billion viewing minutes in 2020.\n\nOther top licensed shows included \"Bluey,\" \"NCIS,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"Cocomelon,\" and \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Apple TV+'s \"Ted Lasso\" (AAPL) was the top original series after racking up nearly 17 billion hours viewed.\n\nThe resurgence of licensed content seems to have brought the streaming wars full circle after companies spent billions to create original IP in a bid to edge out competitors and attract subscribers.\n\nAs content budgets shrink across the board, licensed content can also keep viewers engaged between new seasons of original series.\n\nAlthough Netflix has certainly led that charge — the company recently revealed 45% of all viewing on Netflix stemmed from licensed titles from January to June 2023 — it's actively shut down licensing out its own content.\n\n\"What's interesting is a show like 'Suits,' which has been played on USA for a long time, has been available on Peacock and had been available on Amazon for a couple of years before it hit Netflix, and yet we were able to unlock this enormous, enormous global audience for it,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on a call with reporters late last year.\n\n\"That's the combination of our large subscriber base and our recommendation system that knew to put 'Suits' in front of people who were going love it the most,\" he continued. \"I do not think that that necessarily would happen in reverse. I do think that we can add tremendous value when we license content. I'm not positive that that's reciprocal.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSarandos reiterated that thinking during the company's earnings call last week, saying the streamer is \"open for business\" when it comes to licensing content from competitors.\n\n\"I am thrilled that the studios are more open to licensing again,\" he said. The 'Suits' effect (Source: Getty Images)\n\nDisney (DIS) has been one competitor embracing the change.\n\nABC's \"Grey's Anatomy\" has been highly successful on Netflix while Disney acquired the international broadcasting rights to \"Bluey,\" the number two most-viewed acquired title, from BBC Studios in 2019.\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger confirmed more plans are on the way, particular when it comes to its partnership with Netflix.\n\n\"We’ve actually been licensing content to Netflix, and are going to continue too,\" he told investors during the company's latest earnings call. \"We're actually in discussion with them now about some opportunities, but I wouldn’t expect that we will license our core brands to them.\"\n\nSimilar to Netflix's refusal to license out its original series, Iger said Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars and all likely off limits as they offer \"real competitive advantages\" and are \"differentiators\" for the company.\n\n\"[Those brands] are all doing very, very well on our platform. And I don’t see why, just to basically to chase bucks, we should [license them out] when they are really really important building blocks to the current and future of our streaming business.\"\n\nBut analysts have described that thinking as a double edged sword, citing high debt loads and streaming profitability challenges.\n\nIn a new stock downgrade for Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday, Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall explained future content strategies for legacy players pose a risk as companies weigh licensing content versus maintaining streaming exclusives.\n\n\"One way to accelerate EBITDA and free cash flow would be to let marquee titles like 'The Sopranos,' 'Game of Thrones' or 'Friends' go to deep-pocketed streamers instead of Max — likely billions of untapped revenue potential,\" Cahall said in regards to WBD. \"But, this would come at the expense of Max engagement.\"\n\nAs legacy giants weigh that choice, Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich described content licensing as a \"back to the future\" trend for the industry at large.\n\n\"This should improve content spending return on investments and accelerate revenue and profitability growth going forward,\" she said in a note published earlier this month.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "DJIA Record High 2024: 7 Dow Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now",
        "content": "On Jan. 22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day above 38,000 for the first time in history. The strong performance of the index and historical highs suggest that 2024 will be very strong.\n\nIt also leads investors to wonder which stocks among the 30 listed on the Dow are worth buying and which are worth selling.\n\nGenerally, the U.S. stock market should be robust in 2024. The Dow Jones represents 30 prominent companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Thus, record levels imply overall strength in the U.S. economy. Let’s look at seven Dow stocks and where they’re headed soon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently made news as the stock’s market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Such a high valuation raises the question of whether Microsoft can rise further.\n\nIt can.\n\nInvestors will be unsurprised to hear the reason: Artificial intelligence. Hear me out, though. Microsoft continues to have a lot of opportunities related to AI. The primary opportunity is that of monetization.\n\nIt’s fair to argue that the difference between Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft, as it relates to AI and valuation, is monetization. Microsoft’s current P/E ratio is just below 40 times. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s P/E ratio is above 81 times.\n\nNvidia commands a higher premium due to the monetization of AI. Thus, the more Microsoft can monetize AI, the higher its shares can rise. Of course, Microsoft has done so with its monetization of CoPilot. However, that hasn’t been nearly as successful as Nvidia’s monetization through chip sales, which remain in high demand for AI applications.\n\nIt’s an opportunity for Microsoft, arguably making it a buy at the moment despite recently surpassing a $3 trillion valuation.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.\n\nSource: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s a bad idea to bet against McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock right now. The Golden Arches are operating very well at the moment and are also seeking real, substantial growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors considering McDonald’s a boring, slow-growth firm should think again. In December, the company announced that It plans to increase its footprint to 50,000 restaurants by 2027. That will be its fastest period of growth in history.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s also evident that McDonald’s is attempting to win back market share from competitors—namely, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). The company continues to test its CosMc’s restaurant concept. Long wait times suggest that the restaurant concept has the potential to rest market share from Starbucks with its expansive drinks menu.\n\nAll of that positive news follows a Q3 earnings report, which showed an 11% increase in global system-wide sales. It is little wonder that some analysts expect 2024 will be very strong for McDonald’s, which has caused them to up their ratings.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is little reason to believe that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock should rise soon. Salesforce is in something of a dead zone despite its strong performance of late.\n\nIn the third quarter, Salesforce provided better-than-expected results, including revenues that increased by 11% to $8.7 billion. The better-than-expected performance provided the company the confidence to raise guidance for multiple metrics. That’s all on top of a year that saw Salesforce shares amongst the best performers on the Dow Jones Index.\n\nThe problem is Salesforce’s revenues are expected to grow by 10% in Q4. That’s not a strong enough catalyst to propel CRM shares higher. Instead, investors should look forward to rate cuts expected to begin in June per most consensus opinions.\n\nLower lending rates should Galvanize greater investment in customer relationship management overall. Salesforce continues to heavily tout its AI investment in that regard. Furthermore, it’s also the dominant force in the space. However, investors are going to have to wait a few months for that catalyst to kick in.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) An image of a tan building corner with a blue \"P&G\" logo, an American flag on a post, and two larger building tops in the background under a dark blue sky.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs long as consumers are willing to absorb higher prices, there’s no reason to bet against Procter & Gamble’s (NYSE:PG) stock.\n\nThat’s the message that the market sent upon P&G’s Jan. 23 earnings release. Sales grew by a modest 3% during the most recent quarter, but that didn’t matter despite being a slight miss. What did matter is that Procter & Gamble continues to be able to pass higher prices on to consumers, leading to improved net income.\n\nP&G now expects that net income growth will range between 8 and 9%. It had expected the range to be between 6% and 9% prior. Consumers continue to absorb price increases for their favorite fast-moving goods brands.\n\nThat was the primary takeaway of the stock market on Jan. 23. Shares jumped from $147 to $155 on the earnings release and the news contained therein. Procter & Gamble will continue to rise because consumers remain undeterred.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nResilient consumers are also the primary positive factor for Visa (NYSE:V). Its stock is rising after releasing earnings that showed better than anticipated results. The reason: strong consumer credit spending.\n\n2023 was the year of strong consumerism fueled by credit spending. 2024 is shaping up to be no different. Visa saw its revenues increase by 9% in the first quarter on especially strong cross-border payment volume. American consumers continue to travel in record numbers following the pandemic.\n\nIt’s also clear that if a recession is avoided entirely, consumer credit spending plays a large part in the result. Further, net income increased by 17% during the period.\n\nWhile many companies are looking for ways to find greater efficiency at the moment, Visa has no such problem. Its bottom line results reflect that truth. Again, there’s no reason to bet against Visa, given consumer credit usage over the past year.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarly expectations suggest that the Vision Pro will be another success for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, it’s unlikely that the Vision Pro will do much to send AAPL stock higher in the near term.\n\nFurther, despite strong early pre-release sales, it’s also likely that Vision Pro demand will be limited. Current demand data based on pre-release sales suggest that early enthusiasm is limited to developers and power users.\n\nThe Vision Pro was never expected to be a vital contributor to Apple’s top line at any rate. Apple analysts expect the company to easily sell more than 500,000 headsets, priced at $3,500 apiece. That’s not much for a company of Apple’s stature.\n\niPhone sales continue to be Apple’s bread and butter. Fortunately for Apple investors, there is good news. The iPhone is now the most popular brand in China. That’s particularly good news: Apple had courted other populous Asian nations as China’s economy struggled during 2023.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is currently engaged in a period of growth through consolidation. The company recently agreed to purchase Hess (NYSE:HES) for $60 billion.\n\nIt’s part of a larger wave of consolidation in the energy sector. It’s also one that has drawn the attention of antitrust investigators. While there is no clear indication of the potential outcome, one thing should be noted.\n\nLarge energy firms had a banner year in 2022 after a long dry spell. 2023 was a problematic year again. 2024 is offering signs that are both positive and negative. Demand could remain weak, however, simultaneously, so your political tensions remain high, and crude oil prices have risen lately.\n\nAll things considered, it’s fair to argue that Chevron is subject to many factors that could lower its prices. Chevron’s merger with Hess could just as easily go through, and oil prices could rise, ushering in an era of renewed strength. However, the energy sector faces long-term threats worth considering.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors have shown a particular interest in dividend stocks over time, primarily because of their ability to generate income. Throughout history, it has been observed that companies characterized by stable and growing dividends tend to yield better returns with lower volatility compared to those that don't distribute dividends. Additionally, investors can enhance their income by reinvesting dividends. A study conducted by Hartford Funds revealed that dating back to 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be traced to the impact of reinvested dividends and the compounding effect.\n\nGiven the remarkable returns and increasing investor interest, U.S. companies are striving to sustain and expand their dividend payouts. As per the latest findings from S&P Dow Jones Indices, Q4 2023 witnessed 707 instances of dividend increases. The total value of these dividend hikes amounted to $17.5 billion for the quarter, reflecting a rise from the $16.3 billion reported in Q4 2022. The report also highlighted that within the S&P 500, 403 issues, or 80.1%, are currently distributing dividends. This represents an increase from the 401 issues in Q3 2023 and the 399 issues in Q4 2022. Furthermore, among the Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents, 28 out of the 30 companies pay dividends, with an average yield of 2.54% for all issues and 2.72% for those that do distribute dividends.\n\nThe positive performance has instilled confidence among analysts, leading them to anticipate a favorable outlook for dividends in 2024. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, shared insights on the dividend outlook in the firm’s annual report. He said:\n\n“For 2024, the dollar aggregate of dividends is expected to increase once again. Absent an economic or geopolitical event, S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering volatility better, as the index is expected to post its 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, the index is also expected to log its 13th consecutive record year, with a 4.5% - 5% increase in payments for 2024, compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and its 10.8% increase in 2022. Overall, companies will likely remain cautious in 2024, as they consider both consumer and government spending and also any impact on the political environment.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa Inc.

        "title": "Buffett Bot’s Best Bets: 3 Top Stock Picks From a Warren-Trained AI Model",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is often hailed as one of the greatest investors, with a track record that has consistently outpaced the broader markets. Could artificial intelligence (AI) emulate his success? I recently discovered an intriguing AI model called the “Buffett Bot” that was trained to mimic Warren Buffett.\n\nAs AI continues making strides across industries, it’s no surprise some clever developers have aimed these analytical engines at the financial markets. And basing one on the Oracle of Omaha himself seems like an especially smart play. Of course, this AI isn’t the real Buffett, but it offers a fascinating glimpse into how modern data science attempts to replicate legendary investors.\n\nI’ll be taking a look at the stock picks recently put forward by this Buffett-inspired AI. The model imitates Buffett’s penchant for finding strong yet reasonably-valued businesses. It will be intriguing to see what kind of companies and sectors the Buffett Bot highlights as solid investments. While this AI is unlikely to fully capture the depth of real-world experience and nuanced judgment behind Buffett’s brilliance, it may still surface some appealing prospects. At the very least, its selections should provide thoughtful food for thought.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoody’s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoody’s (NYSE:MCO) holds an enormously influential position in global finance as one of the “Big Three” credit ratings agencies alongside S&P (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch. This oligopoly enjoys durable competitive advantages from high barriers to entry and a sticky customer base. Thus, I’m not surprised to see Buffett Bot tap Moody’s as a smart Buffett-style bet.\n\nAfter all, the real Buffett also knows a thing or two about this industry leader – MCO occupies a sizable 2.6% allocation in Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. For a man with a highly concentrated portfolio anchored by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), carving out such a large niche for Moody’s signals conviction in its prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd why shouldn’t Buffett have this conviction? Moody’s just delivered another quarter of impressive growth in Q3 2023. Revenue grew 15% year-over-year, powered by strong performance across ratings and research, data and analytics, and M&A. Meanwhile, the company’s EBITDA leapt 32%.\n\nNo doubt, Moody’s trades at a steep premium. Its shares currently command a valuation of roughly 12-times forward sales and 39-times forward earnings. However, the company’s growth prospects support these rich valuations. Analysts forecast annual earnings per share growth of around 15% over the next five years on the back of near double-digit revenue expansion. In an entrenched triopoly that’s strategically expanding its presence across high-margin adjacencies, I believe Moody’s warrants its above-average multiple.\n\nAs an added bonus: Moody’s pays out a small but growing dividend that yields 0.8%. Moody’s offers compelling total return potential as a Buffett-approved blue-chip with fortress positioning in an essential global industry. I agree with the Oracle and his digital doppelgänger that this is a long-term winner.\n\nBrookfield Asset Management (BAM) bam international stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile not currently a Berkshire holding, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) aligns nicely with the Buffett school of thought. This alternative asset manager focuses on real assets like infrastructure, real estate, renewables, and private equity – tangible categories that benefit society. Its value-based approach centers on acquiring high-quality assets during times of distress or dislocation to generate strong risk-adjusted returns.\n\nIn other words, Brookfield brings a long-term lens to its investing framework, and is backed by a strong balance sheet – key “Buffettesque” principles. So, I understand why a digital version of the Oracle tapped Brookfield as an intriguing pick. As attention pivots toward renewable energy and infrastructure spending while real estate rebounds from pandemic lows, this is a company with plenty of tailwinds to consider.\n\nThe company’s growth forecasts look promising, too. Brookfield anticipates 17% annualized sales growth over the next two years alongside 19% earnings growth in 2025. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times based on estimated 2024 earnings seems somewhat rich, I believe this premium makes sense for a company eyeing high-teens bottom-line boosts. Plus, shareholders get paid to wait via a 3.2% dividend yield that should keep growing.\n\nI agree with Buffett Bot that BAM stock warrants a spot in a long-term-focused portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s no secret that Buffett largely missed the boat on new tech like AI over the years. But the small Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) position (recently trimmed) in Berkshire’s portfolio proves that even old dogs can learn some new tricks. And while Buffett may not be ready to fully embrace fast-moving tech disruptors, his digital descendant shows more enthusiasm in tapping Amazon’s immense potential.\n\nNow, AMZN stock trades at a nosebleed valuation. Shares of the e-commerce giant currently trade for more than 82-times trailing earnings. But when you dominate the secular growth engines of e-commerce and cloud like Amazon does, lofty multiples feel warranted. Remember, AWS alone commands a 41.5% market share in the cloud, greater than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) combined!\n\nMeanwhile, early pandemic aftershocks to the e-commerce sector have settled, paving the way for growth re-acceleration. Over the last three years, Amazon’s net sales grew outpaced over 84% of marketwide peers. And though its price-earnings ratio seems extremely rich for a company of this scale, it falls below Amazon’s 5-year average near 120-times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 30, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Q1 Earnings: Key Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's a highly critical week for earnings, with several mega-cap technology companies slated to reveal quarterly results. The strength of these mega-cap names has been admired by all, with many expecting positive results to keep overall market momentum flowing.\n\nPerhaps the most popular of the bunch, market leader Apple will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market's close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.\n\nShares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally.\n\nHow do expectations stack up heading into the release? Let's take a quick look at headline estimates and a few key other metrics to keep an eye on within the release.\n\nHeadline Figures\n\nAnalysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year.\n\nRevenue expectations have been revised modestly lower, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period.\n\nKey Metrics\n\nApple's services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. It includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.\n\nFor the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion, reflecting 12.5% growth. Apple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late.\n\nAs expected, iPhone revenue will also be a big focus, particularly as the company continues to face competition in other markets. For the quarter, we expect Apple to post $68.6 billion in iPhone revenue, suggesting an increase of roughly 4% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\niPhone results have been primarily mixed as of late, with the company falling short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases.\n\nValuation\n\nShares are trading at a premium relative to historical levels, with the current 28.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting above the 25.2X five-year median. The forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio sits at 7.4X, near five-year highs and above the 6.0X five-year median.\n\nStill, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company's dominant stance, as reflected by the share performance.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWe've got a loaded slate of earnings this week, with belovedApple a part of the reporting docket. Earnings estimates have been taken higher whereas revenue expectations have fallen modestly, with both items expected to be higher than the year-ago period.\n\nInvestors will closely watch the company's Services results as well as iPhone sales, two key growth drivers for Apple. Heading into the release, the stock is presently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

This pessimism in the market is putting pressure on policymakers in China to consider implementing rate cuts in order to stimulate economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Specifically, stock prices in Hong Kong saw a drop of approximately 2%, while mainland China stocks were on track for a third consecutive day of decline. The recent liquidation order issued against China Evergrande Group on Monday intensified market anxieties, leading to a notable 4% decrease in a Bloomberg index tracking Chinese developers. The Evergrande liquidation saga has cast a shadow over both the Chinese and Hong Kong markets, prompting investors to reassess their positions and adopt a cautious approach. This development underscores the significant influence that regulatory and economic factors in China can have on global financial markets. As market sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty looms, investors are closely monitoring the situation and its potential implications for broader market dynamics. The possibility of rate cuts by Chinese policymakers is being closely watched as investors seek clues about the future direction of economic policy and its impact on market stability.\n\nThe oil market remained stable as investors awaited the United States' response to the recent deadly attack on American troops in Jordan, reported Bloomberg. This attack has the potential to escalate tensions in a region crucial to global crude production. Brent crude futures were trading above $82 per barrel following a 1.4% decline on Monday, despite the drone strike targeting US soldiers. Iran has attempted to distance itself from the attack. Additionally, data indicating that OPEC+ is making a sluggish start to implementing new output cuts contributed to downward pressure on oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also showed little movement amidst the uncertainty. Oil traders are closely monitoring developments, particularly any indications of the US government's response to the attack. There are concerns that any action taken by the US could further heighten tensions in the region, potentially impacting oil supply and prices. As a result, market participants are proceeding cautiously, awaiting clarity on the situation and its potential implications for the oil market.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets.

(NASDAQ:ABNB)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nOn January 29, Barclays analyst Mario Lu reiterated his Underweight rating on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) while adjusting the price target upwards from $100 to $110. This decision comes amidst ongoing scrutiny and cautious sentiment regarding the company's performance and valuation. Despite the upward revision in the price target, Lu maintains a conservative stance on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) outlook, suggesting that the stock may not offer significant upside potential in the near term. The decision to maintain the Underweight rating indicates Barclays' skepticism about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) ability to justify its current valuation. The revised price target of $110 suggests that Barclays anticipates limited growth prospects for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), especially considering the prevailing market conditions and the company's financial performance. While the price target raise acknowledges certain positive factors, such as the company's strong brand recognition and market presence, it also underscores the cautious approach taken by analysts like Lu. As of the closing bell on January 29, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock was trading at $152.70, reflecting the market's reaction to the revised price target and Barclays' assessment of the company's valuation.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were Illumina, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Microsoft. Airbnb continues to deliver double-digit growth in revenue and nights booked, which is especially impressive given the year-ago growth rates it delivered on these same metrics (+29% and +31, respectively). Despite these attractive results, the stock sold off as investors reacted to fourth quarter guidance that came in slightly below expectations. Coming into the fourth quarter, the stock was up +60% on the back of strong fundamentals. Stepping back, nothing has changed. Private rentals continue to take market share from hotels globally, and Airbnb continues to take market share within private rentals given its relentless focus on improving the guest and host experience. Looking ahead, we expect many years of robust earnings and cash flow growth from here.”\n\n09. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nUpside Potential: 4%\n\nOn January 29, Baird analyst William Power increased the price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $186.00 to $200.00, affirming an Outperform rating. This adjustment reflects Baird's optimistic outlook on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) performance and potential within the technology sector. With a revised price target suggesting a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, the analyst's move indicates confidence in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ability to continue delivering value to investors. The decision to maintain the Outperform rating underscores Baird's belief in Apple's strong position in the industry and its ability to outperform market expectations. The raised price target of $200.00 reflects Baird's positive assessment of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth prospects, innovation pipeline, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was trading at $191.73, indicating a modest premium over the revised price target set by Baird.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. While on a total attribution basis, Apple was not a top three detractor to our full-year return, given its extremely large weighting in the Index, we feel it’s worth sharing our thoughts.\n\nThe company’s share price appreciated nearly 50% in a year when its revenue declined and earnings per share was relatively flat with the previous year.\n\nFor 2024, consensus expectations are for low-single-digit revenue growth and only slightly faster EPS growth. These pedestrian growth rates are not surprising for a company with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue. What is more surprising is that Apple shares trade at nearly 30x forward earnings, a large premium to the market and many faster-growing, competitively advantaged businesses.\n\nWhile we continue to think Apple is a wonderful business, it is also a slow growing one with risks that we do not see as insignificant. Apple’s entire supply chain is based in China and much of its incremental revenue growth also comes from China, so if there is a U.S.-China issue that makes it more difficult for U.S.-based companies that have access to large amounts of local data to operate in China, Apple’s business would likely face more challenges than many others. In addition, much of Apple’s services growth and margin expansion has come from direct payments from Google to be the default search provider on iOS devices. This practice is currently the subject of a lawsuit between Google and the U.S. Justice Department. If this practice is deemed unlawful, it could take away a large and highly profitable revenue stream from Apple’s already slow growth engine. While we closely cover Apple, we continue to believe we have better investment opportunities. Apple’s current P/E is above our Portfolio’s weighted average, yet its long-term earnings growth rate is likely to be lower than even our slowest growing holding, according to our research.”\n\n08. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nUpside Potential: 4%\n\nOn January 29, Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger increased the price target for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) from $610.00 to $678.00, upholding an Outperform rating. This adjustment underscores Oppenheimer's positive outlook on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) prospects within the software and financial technology industry. With the revised price target indicating a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, Schneeberger's move reflects confidence in Intuit's ability to deliver value to investors. Maintaining the Outperform rating signals Oppenheimer's belief in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) competitive positioning and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $678.00 reflects Oppenheimer's bullish stance on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) long-term growth prospects, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock was trading at $652.88, indicating a slight premium over the revised price target set by Oppenheimer.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Following significant under-performance, some high-quality businesses in these sectors are now becoming more attractive from a valuation perspective – in our language they are now getting warmer on our Bench of potential investments.\n\nOur ‘all-weather’ portfolio centred around our unique definition of ‘quality’ delivered strong performance in the September quarter. Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Natural Resource Partners, in alphabetical order), and another three companies almost reached this level of positive contribution. No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.\n\nAs part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.\n\nIntuit held its annual Investor Day during the quarter and the presentation materials are well-worth a review. Intuit is at the forefront of commercial application of artificial intelligence (AI) across its portfolio of businesses – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. Intuit has been investing in AI for many years, well before ChatGPT became a buzz word…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n07. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nUpside Potential: 7%\n\nOn January 29, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson increased the price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from $153 to $165 while affirming an Overweight rating. This adjustment reflects Keybanc's optimistic outlook on Alphabet's prospects within the technology and internet services industry. With the revised price target suggesting a 7% upside potential compared to the current market price, Patterson's decision underscores confidence in Alphabet's ability to generate value for investors. By maintaining the Overweight rating, Keybanc expresses its conviction in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) competitive position and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $165 reflects Keybanc's bullish perspective on Alphabet's long-term growth potential, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It indicates that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. At the closing time on January 29, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock was trading at $153.51, signaling a slight premium over the revised price target set by Keybanc. This adjustment is expected to influence investor sentiment and contribute to ongoing discussions about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) position as a leading player in the technology and internet services market.\n\n06. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nUpside Potential: 9%\n\nOn January 29, Morgan Stanley raised its target price on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares from $39.00 to $48.00, while maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating. This adjustment reflects Morgan Stanley's assessment of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) position within the semiconductor industry and its outlook for the company's future performance. With the revised target price suggesting a 9% upside potential compared to the current market price, Morgan Stanley's decision underscores a moderate level of optimism regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) prospects. By maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating, Morgan Stanley acknowledges Intel's strengths and weaknesses relative to its peers in the industry. This rating suggests that Intel's performance is expected to align with the broader market trends, without significant outperformance or underperformance. The raised target price of $48.00 reflects Morgan Stanley's belief in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) ability to execute its strategic initiatives and drive shareholder value over the long term. It indicates that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting a favorable investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was trading at $43.84, indicating a potential upside from the revised target price set by Morgan Stanley.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now 11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli Billionaire Mason Hawkins’ 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThere's a lot riding on results from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) out later today.\n\nBut the market's reaction to last week's earnings report from Netflix (NFLX) may have eased the pressure on what members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" have in store for investors this week.\n\nData from FactSet highlighted by Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer in Sunday's Morning Brief showed how much heavy lifting the Magnificent Seven companies, minus Tesla (TSLA), are expected to do for the S&P 500 this earnings season.\n\nThis group of six companies — Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft, and Nvidia (NVDA) — are expected to report earnings growth north of 50% during the fourth quarter. The rest of the index should see earnings, collectively, fall 10.4% from the same quarter last year.

(Chris Pizzello/AP Photo) (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\nWere the company to have missed these growth targets and cautioned on the benefits these initiatives are providing in pursuit of this target, investors may have judged the stock more harshly.\n\nAggregate tailwinds can only take a stock so far. Ultimately, management needs to deliver on its promises.\n\nBut the reception Netflix earned from the Street shows the willingness investors have in this environment to reward execution.\n\nWith 25% of the S&P 500 having reported earnings through last Friday, John Butters's team at FactSet found earnings beats are being rewarded more than average while misses are being penalized less than average.\n\nAnd how this trend holds up as the remaining 75% of the index reports over the coming weeks might have more to say about the market's overall direction than results from the companies most responsible for actual earnings growth.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Vision Pro Is a Potential Silver Lining",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.\n\nLooking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.\n\nAccording to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.\n\nThere is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.\n\nApple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.\n\nToday, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.\n\nThe relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.\n\nApple’s Scale Problem\n\nApple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.\n\nThe problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.\n\nEven if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.\n\nIs Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nApple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple’s prospects, but they’re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here’s what some analysts have said about Apple.\n\nOn January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock’s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.\n\nOn January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.\n\nLast week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.\n\nOverall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.\n\nThe Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not\n\nApple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "It’s a highly critical week for earnings, with several mega-cap technology companies slated to reveal quarterly results. The strength of these mega-cap names has been admired by all, with many expecting positive results to keep overall market momentum flowing.\n\nPerhaps the most popular of the bunch, market leader Apple AAPL will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.\n\nShares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow do expectations stack up heading into the release? Let’s take a quick look at headline estimates and a few key other metrics to keep an eye on within the release.\n\nHeadline Figures\n\nAnalysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRevenue expectations have been revised modestly lower, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Metrics\n\nApple’s services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. It includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.\n\nFor the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion, reflecting 12.5% growth. Apple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late, as we can see below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs expected, iPhone revenue will also be a big focus, particularly as the company continues to face competition in other markets. For the quarter, we expect Apple to post $68.6 billion in iPhone revenue, suggesting an increase of roughly 4% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\niPhone results have been primarily mixed as of late, with the company falling short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation\n\nShares are trading at a premium relative to historical levels, with the current 28.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting above the 25.2X five-year median. The forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio sits at 7.4X, near five-year highs and above the 6.0X five-year median.\n\nStill, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company’s dominant stance, as reflected by the share performance. Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWe’ve got a loaded slate of earnings this week, with beloved Apple AAPL a part of the reporting docket. Earnings estimates have been taken higher whereas revenue expectations have fallen modestly, with both items expected to be higher than the year-ago period.\n\nInvestors will closely watch the company’s Services results as well as iPhone sales, two key growth drivers for Apple. Heading into the release, the stock is presently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Flutter has said it will make New York its primary listing in a blow to the London Stock Exchange - Hollie Adams/Bloomberg\n\nThe owner of Paddy Power is poised to quit the FTSE 100 and shift its main listing to New York, delivering a fresh blow to London’s struggling stock market.\n\nFlutter, which also owns PokerStars and Betfair, said on Monday it now sees the US as its “natural home” and will now work towards shifting its primary listing to New York.\n\nWhile it would retain a secondary share listing in London, the shift would likely make Flutter ineligible for inclusion on FTSE indexes.\n\nFlutter, which is worth £28.9bn, announced plans to pursue a secondary listing in the US last year and shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Monday.\n\nHowever, the company has upgraded its US ambitions following discussions with shareholders. Flutter will ask shareholders to vote on the plan at its AGM in May, with the move expected to take effect over the summer if it is approved.\n\nPeter Jackson, Flutter’s chief executive, said: “With our NYSE listing effective today, this is a pivotal moment for the group as we make Flutter more accessible to US based investors and gain access to deeper capital markets.”\n\nAs well as Flutter, Irish construction group CRH last year shifted from London to New York and the British stock market missed out on the $54bn initial public offering (IPO) of Cambridge-chipmaker Arm.\n\nThe number of requests to float on the London Stock Exchange’s main market has plunged to its lowest level in at least six years, according to Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) data, while the number of companies listed on the stock market has shrunk by more than 25pc over the last decade, according to research from trading platform XTB.\n\nFlutter is focusing on the US amid an explosion in gambling there spurred by a Supreme Court decision in 2018. The decision effectively ended a ban on sports betting at a federal level in every state but Nevada and has sparked a rapid expansion in the industry. US gambling revenues hit $16.2bn (£12.8bn) in the third quarter of 2023, according to the American Gaming Association.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it is best known for running the high street bookie Paddy Power in the UK, Flutter also owns a majority stake in FanDuel, one of the US’s biggest sports betting firms. The US accounts for around 40pc of its business and sales there grew by 38pc to £3.6bn in 2023.\n\nMr Jackson said: “We believe a US primary listing is the natural home for Flutter given FanDuel’s No. 1 position in the US, a market which we expect to contribute the largest proportion of profits in the near future.”\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:14 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

It now has over 40 aircraft and more than 5,000 staff.\n\nIn 2022, it posted a profit of $78.4m (£61.7m) on a turnover of $1.03bn (£812m).\n\nPeter Foster, chief executive, said that there had been strong investor interest in the flotation “supported by strong financial and operational track record, significant growth opportunities, and an experienced, disciplined management team”.\n\n05:30 PM GMT\n\nApple accuses Home Office of ‘unprecedented overreach’ in row over spying laws\n\nApple has accused the Home office of an “unprecedented overreach” in an escalating row over new spying laws, reports James Titcomb.\n\nThe iPhone maker said it was “deeply concerned” about changes to security legislation that would give the Home Secretary stronger powers over encrypted messaging apps.\r\n\r\nApple has previously warned that the legislation could lead to apps such as FaceTime and iMessage being removed from the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office is amending the Investigatory Powers Act, which gives the Government powers to force messaging apps to break encryption.\r\n\r\nThe new rules, branded a snooper’s charter by critics, will require tech companies to inform the Home Secretary before they make changes affecting apps’ security.\n\nThey would also allow the Government to secretly apply its powers to companies based overseas, which Apple said could prevent it from applying security updates around the world.\r\n\r\nIn a statement ahead of the final debate of the amended bill in the House of Lords on Tuesday, Apple said: “Protecting our users’ privacy and the security of their data is at the very heart of everything we do at Apple.\r\n\r\n“We’re deeply concerned that the proposed amendments to the Investigatory Powers Act now before Parliament place users’ privacy and security at risk.\r\n\r\n“It’s an unprecedented overreach by the government and, if enacted, the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.”\r\n\r\nApple and WhatsApp, which make the two most popular encrypted messaging apps, have warned that they would withdraw their services from the UK rather than comply with orders to weaken the protections.\r\n\r\nThe Government has made minor concessions on the new laws, but tech groups have continued to oppose the core changes to the legislation.\r\n\r\nThe third reading in the House of Lords on Tuesday will be followed by scrutiny in the Commons, although the legislation is likely to go through, given it is supported by the two major parties.\r\n\r\nA Government spokesperson said: “The first job of government is to keep the country safe and as technology advances and changes, so do the threats that the UK faces.\n\n“We have always been clear that we support technological innovation and private and secure communications technologies, including end-to-end encryption, but this cannot come at a cost to public safety.\n\n“It is critical that decisions about lawful access, which protect the country from child sexual abusers and terrorists, are taken by those who are democratically accountable and approved by Parliament.”\n\n05:06 PM GMT\n\nBrakes slam on new EU trade deal after farmer protests\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, has told the European Commission that it is impossible to conclude trade deal negotiations with South America’s Mercosur common market, Reuters has reported.\n\nFarmers have staged massive protests in France over the past few weeks, angry about rising costs and cheap imports, following similar action in other European countries, including Germany and Poland.\n\nFarmers in France have  objected to ongoing talks on a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur nations, which they say would allow cheap food imports that do not meet strict EU standards.\n\nPresident Macron “has very firmly reiterated to the Commission the fact it was impossible to conclude talks in these conditions,” a French presidential adviser told reporters in a briefing ahead of an EU summit on Thursday.\n\nThe adviser added that the EU understood it was impossible to reach a deal in this context and that EU talks with Mercosur countries had been stopped. He said:\n\nThe European Commission had understood it was impossible to reach a deal in this context. I think it has seen the situation in France, in Germany, in Poland, in the Netherlands, across Europe.\n\nIt is our understanding it has instructed its negotiators to put an end to the negotiation session underway in Brazil and in particular cancel the visit of the Commission’s vice-president that had been envisaged in view of a conclusion\n\n04:57 PM GMT\n\nFootsie closes down\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed down slightly by 0.03pc.

James Titcomb reports:\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology plans to canvas semiconductor companies about whether it should participate in developing a microchip design known as RISC-V.\n\nThe chip architecture, pronounced “risk five”, is attracting growing interest among technology businesses around the world but has been particularly welcomed in China as a potential way to blunt the effects of US chip sanctions.\n\nIt is developed as an “open” standard, meaning the technology is free to use and available to all, and so is not subject to US export rules.\n\nRISC-V is also seen as a growing threat to Arm, Britain’s biggest technology company, whose designs are predominantly used in the sort of low-energy microchips that RISC-V works on.\n\nRISC-V International has hundreds of members including major companies like Google and Intel. Its members also include the Chinese Academy of Sciences alongside tech companies such as Huawei.\n\nUS politicians have called on the White House to impose restrictions around RISC-V over concerns it could be used by Beijing.\n\nA group of Republican and Democrat Members of Congress wrote to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in November, saying: “While the benefits of open-source collaboration on RISC-V promise to be significant, it can only be realised when contributors are working with the sole aim of improving the technology, and not aiding the geopolitical interests of the PRC.”\n\nRISC-V International has pushed back on the calls. It said in October: “Contemplated actions by governments for an unprecedented restriction in open standards will have the consequence of diminished access to the global marketplace of products, solutions, and talent.”\n\nA Government spokesman said: “Semiconductors underpin our economy and national security, as well as being vital to our technology superpower ambitions. It is crucial we have a comprehensive understanding of the risks and benefits developments in this field pose to the UK, including in RISC-V.\n\n“Acknowledging that RISC-V’s open nature presents risks to manage around security, we have been clear in our Semiconductor Strategy, published in May last year, that it offers significant opportunities for innovation in the industry.” RISC-V is seen as a growing threat to Arm - Bloomberg\n\n03:50 PM GMT\n\nMarkets become less confident about US interest rate cuts\n\nThe dollar rose on Monday as investors prepared for the prospect that the Federal Reserve could push back against expectations of an imminent rate cut when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and amid doveish comments from two European central bankers.\n\nThe Fed is expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday and investors will focus on comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, after he indicated in December that the Fed is moving towards a programme of cutting interest rates.\n\nHelen Given, foreign exchange trader at Monex USA in Washington DC, said:\n\nThe [macroeconomic] picture in the US looks a lot better than the macro picture in European Union countries and the eurozone in general.\n\nWe’ll probably see a bit of pushback on the last meeting. I’d expect that a lot of the dollar strength that we’re seeing today, and we should continue to see until that decision release on Wednesday, is coming from shifting expectations.\n\n03:45 PM GMT\n\nEuro under pressure after doveish comments from central bankers\n\nThe euro has dropped slightly in trading today, down 0.37pc against the dollar and 0.20pc against the pound, after doveish comments from a couple of the European Central Bank’s governing council.\n\nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains:\n\nPortuguese ECB governing council member [Mario] Centeno said that rate cuts should start sooner rather than later so that the process is gradual, without any need to wait for wages data. His comments were followed by Slovakia member Peter Kazimir who argued that rate cuts were also on the horizon although his confidence over timing was less fixed, but that June was more likely than April.\n\n03:37 PM GMT\n\nBT accused of ripping off elderly landline customers in landmark court case\n\nBT has been accused of ripping off elderly landline customers in a landmark £1.3bn court case. James Warrington reports:\n\nThe telecoms giant is facing a class action lawsuit over claims it “systematically” overcharged around 3m customers – many of whom are elderly – on their landline bills.\n\nThe case, led by former Ofcom executive Justin Le Patourel, accuses BT of consistently increasing prices even as its own costs were falling.\n\nIf successful, affected customers could be owed damages of between £300 and £400.\n\nMr Le Patourel said: “We believe BT has been systematically overcharging millions of customers over many years, and those customers could be owed hundreds of pounds each.”\n\nThe first trial, which covers around 1.5m customers, began in the Competition Appeals Tribunal today.\n\nThe trial is expected to last eight weeks, with a judgement before the end of the year.\n\nThe legal action is centred on a 2017 Ofcom ruling, which found BT had been overcharging landline customers since 2009.\n\nThe former monopoly agreed to cut bills by £7 per month from April 2018, but did not compensate customers for past overcharging.\n\nThe first group in the class action lawsuit are “voice only” customers who had a BT landline service between October 2015 and April 2018.\n\nOfcom has previously said that these customers were more likely to be old, on low incomes or vulnerable.\n\nThe second group of around 2m customers had a BT landline service alongside broadband between October 2015 and December 2023, bundling these services together into a single, discounted package.\n\nMr Le Patourel said the case was particularly urgent given the age of many of the claimants. More than half a million affected customers have already passed away, though their estates will be entitled to apply for compensation if the case is successful.\n\nA spokesman for BT said: “We take our responsibilities to customers very seriously and are dedicated to keeping our customers connected, while helping those who need it most. This claim relates to a technical landline pricing issue which was resolved by Ofcom in 2017.\n\n“We do not accept that our pricing was anti-competitive back then, and as such are committed to robustly defending our position at trial.” A BT shop in London - Rasid Necati Aslim/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n03:35 PM GMT\n\nHanding over\n\nThat’s all from me today.

The decision effectively ended a ban on sports betting at a federal level in every state but Nevada and has sparked a rapid expansion in the industry. US gambling revenues hit $16.2bn (£12.8bn) in the third quarter of 2023, according to the American Gaming Association.\n\nWhile it is best known for running the high street bookie Paddy Power in the UK, Flutter also owns a majority stake in FanDuel, one of the US’s biggest sports betting firms. The US accounts for around 40pc of its business and sales there grew by 38pc to £3.6bn in 2023.\n\nMr Jackson said: “We believe a US primary listing is the natural home for Flutter given FanDuel’s No. 1 position in the US, a market which we expect to contribute the largest proportion of profits in the near future.”\n\nShares in London Stock Exchange Group have fallen 1.5pc today.\n\n03:12 PM GMT\n\nGerman department store KaDeWe files for bankruptcy\n\nKaDeWe Group, which operates the eponymous Berlin department store, said it has filed for insolvency, marking the latest fallout of a widening property crisis in the region.\n\nKaDeWe, which is part of the troubled Signa real estate empire, is a landmark tourist destination in Berlin, and the group also includes the Oberpollinger department store in Munich and the Alsterhaus in Hamburg.\n\nSigna, the insolvent Austrian-based property empire that has become the biggest casualty so far in Europe’s real-estate crisis, bought KaDeWe as part of a retail portfolio a decade ago.\n\nIn 2015, Signa sold a majority stake to the Thai retail conglomerate Central Group.\n\nSince the Signa holding company filed for insolvency last year, many of its divisions have followed suit.\n\nKaDeWe, stands for Kaufhaus Des Westens and is pronounced kah-day-vay, will remain open.\n\nSince it opened in 1907, the building on Wittenberg Platz, not far from the Zoologischer Garten railway station, has become a symbol of the German capital to rival the Brandenburg Gate and the television tower at Alexander Platz.

It is already illegal to sell vapes to anyone under 18, but evidence shows cheaper, more colourfully packaged disposable vapes are driving the rise in youth vaping - Rasid Necati Aslim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\n10:12 AM GMT\n\nPound strengthens ahead of interest rate decision\n\nThe pound has strengthened slightly ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision due on Thursday.\n\nSterling was flat against the dollar at $1.27 but was up 0.3pc against the euro, which is worth 85p.\n\nIt comes as the Bank of England is expected to hold interest rates at their 16-year highs of 5.25pc later this week, while the US Federal Reserve is also expected to leave its borrowing costs unchanged from their 23-year highs.\n\nThe European Central Bank last week held interest rates at a record-high 4pc and reaffirmed its commitment to fighting inflation.\n\nHowever, traders are piling on bets that the ECB will cut interest rates from April, with nearly 140 basis points of easing priced in for the year.\n\nIn the US, strong economic data and pushback from central bankers have prompted traders to adjust expectations for Fed rate cuts.\n\nMarkets are currently pricing in a 49pc chance of a US rate cut in March, the CME FedWatch tool showed, compared with an 86pc chance at the end of December.\n\nMeanwhile, traders think there is about a 42pc chance the Bank of England will cut interest rates in May.\n\n09:53 AM GMT\n\nAir Astana aims for £757m valuation in London float\n\nKazakhstan’s national carrier, Air Astana, has said it is set for a stock market valuation of up to $962m (£757m) when it floats in London next month.\n\nThe central Asian airline, which is nearly 50pc owned by British defence giant BAE Systems, has set the indicative price range for its dual listing in London and Kazakhstan at between $2.13 (£1.68) and $2.75 (£2.16) per share.\n\nThis would value the group at between $770m (£606m) and $962m (£757m). The final price is expected to be announced around February 9, according to the company.\n\nIts listing would provide a welcome boost to the London initial public offering (IPO) market amid a dearth of City deals and flotations.\n\nAir Astana is 49pc owned by BAE Systems, with the remainder owned by the Kazakh sovereign wealth fund.\n\nBAE is expected to cut its stake as part of the float, netting the FTSE 100 stalwart a windfall, depending on how much of its holding it sells.\n\nThe carrier expects to raise around $120m (£94.5m) from the float.\n\nAir Astana has 49 aircraft and carried seven million passengers in 2022, flying to major international destinations such as London, Amsterdam and Beijing.

However, by the fourth quarter a third of the companies issuing warnings had annual revenues of over £1bn in a sign of how widespread pressures had become.\n\nJo Robinson, a partner at EY, said:\n\nPervasive uncertainty in 2023 created major challenges for businesses around earnings and forecasting, and this is reflected in the number of profit warnings issued last year.\n\nWhile pressure around costs eased somewhat toward the year-end, the uptick in warnings caused by delays to business decisions and weak consumer confidence indicates an ongoing reluctance to commit to discretionary spending.\n\n09:07 AM GMT\n\nOil market was 'underpricing risks', warn economists\n\nOil prices have risen 8.7pc since the start of the year, from $77 towards $84, amid a cocktail of geopolitical risks.\n\nEconomists fear the situation will get worse amid attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the Israel-Hamas conflict - as well as questions over demand from China.\n\nPeople talk about pent up demand and forget about pent up geopolitical risk, I agree with @ZiadMDaoud the market has been underestimating the explosive situation we are in today.

Home sellers are being forced to slash their asking prices by 10pc or more as the market stagnates in the wake of surging interest rates.\n\nA fifth of sellers are cutting prices by a tenth or greater, according to the property website Zoopla.\n\nIn London and the South East, the proportion of sellers accepting a discount on this scale rises to almost one in four.\n\nThe housing market has struggled in the wake of the cost of living crisis, which has forced the Bank of England to increase interest rates to a 16-year high. Mortgage costs have surged as a result.\n\nHowever, Zoopla did find some reasons for optimism. Buyer demand has risen 12pc with the biggest increase in London, of 21pc.\n\nAgreed sales have also increased across the country, up 13pc compared to the same time last year with sales rising in all regions.\n\nThis indicates buyers and sellers are more aligned on pricing, according to Zoopla.\n\nRichard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, said: “This improvement in activity will support sales volumes which, at one million, reached an eleven year low in 2023.”\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Labour and Tories risk reigniting debt crisis, warns top investor | Leading investment firm said the markets will be quick to punish financial recklessness\n\n2) Octopus in talks to help power Ukraine after Russia smashes grid | Energy company exploring use of pioneering software with Kyiv-based DTEK\n\n3) One in five young people take time off for mental health | Research by Prince’s Trust comes amid wave of long-term sickness striking Britain\n\n4) Xi curbs short selling after Chinese market plunges | Crackdown is latest attempt to prevent further falls in share prices\n\n5) Post Office scandal company to sell supermarket face-scanners | Fujitsu has developed technology that can check shoppers’ ages\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nChinese equities led a rally in Asian stocks to start the week, after regulators took new steps over the weekend to support the market.\n\nOil climbed after a step-up in Middle East violence, as a missile attack by Yemen’s Houthi group caused a fire on a fuel tanker in the Red Sea, while three US troops were killed after a drone attack in Jordan.\n\nThe dollar and US Treasury yields hovered in the middle of recent ranges ahead of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve policy meeting later in the week.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 1.4pc, and a sub-index of mainland property shares surged 3.6pc after China’s securities regulator said on Sunday that it will fully suspend the lending of restricted shares.\n\nRegional stocks had already started the day on a firm footing, but extended gains after the Hong Kong open, with South Korea’s Kospi advancing 1.2pc, while Australia’s stock benchmark added 0.4pc.\n\nTokyo stocks closed higher as investors cheered the strength of US shares after the Dow reached a fresh high.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8pc, or 275.87 points, to 36,026.94, while the broader Topix index added 1.3pc, or 31.83 points, to 2,529.48.",

That is why a significant growth of attention to Qorvo and QRVO shares is expected.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFifty of the company’s facilities in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe continue to provide consumers with modern products. As a result of the tremendous work, sales in Q2 FY 2024 approached $1.1 billion. Almost half of this amount was accounted for by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). And deliveries to these companies are only growing.\n\nAfter October 2023, QRVO demonstrated its capacity to grow rapidly as one of the promising 5G technology stocks. An analysis of the company’s intrinsic value shows a value of roughly $162, indicating a great time to enter.\n\nIn the next two years, the company plans to increase cash flow and grow its revenue by 49%. If the company’s expenses remain under control, investors may find themselves in a significant gain, taking advantage of the current undervaluation of the asset.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $10 billion and exceeding analysts’ expectations for earnings per share, Qorvo is a highly promising investment target. The stock’s one-year low and high are $80.62 and $114.97, respectively. Analysts have been revising QRVO upward in the last three months. Given that Qorvo has exceeded earnings expectations for 20 consecutive quarters, investors can feel more confident about having shares of this company in their portfolio.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) Verizon store sign. VZ stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\n5G and broadband are key focus areas for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The company’s performance over the past few months shows how right it is. 400,000 new subscriptions in Q3 2023 and the success of myPlan helped to strengthen Verizon’s position.\n\nIt’s worth looking at the company’s Q4 2023 results. According to this data, total revenue reached $35.1 billion, which is similar to the last quarter of 2022. Operating income growth is observed in both the business and consumer segments. In both cases, the growth rate is close to 3%. Sales of wireless services proved to be a significant source of revenue for the company, growing to $19.4 billion.\n\nThe growth of the customer base demonstrates the company’s advantages over other providers in the industry and is consistent with the marketing campaign. This is evidenced by the 16.9% increase in postpaid phone top-ups — the best result in the last four years. That is, Verizon is able not only to retain its current customers but also to lure customers from competitors.\n\nThe company’s shares did not stay away from such improvements and gained in value. From October’s $30, VZ experienced a surge, rising above $42, making it an enticing option among 5G technology stocks. Verizon can attract investors not only because of the company’s performance but also because of its competitive dividend. The dividend yield is about 6.35%, which is above the market average and attracts income-oriented investors to VZ.\n\nT-Mobile US (TMUS) tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facade\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith 21.6 million prepaid users and 96.3 million customers, T-Mobile US (TMUS) is the largest wireless operator in the United States. Keeping pace with the times, the company focuses on 5G to maintain its market position. Its 5G network is the largest and fastest in the country.\n\nComparing the 3rd quarter of 2023 and 2022, the company made a breakthrough in terms of net profit, marking an unprecedented 322% growth, positioning T-Mobile US as a standout among 5G technology stocks. In one quarter, T-Mobile managed to earn $2.1 billion, with the stocks’ performance being the best indicator of the company’s success. T-Mobile showed a profit of $1.82 per share, surprising even experts who predicted lower profitability.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 EBITDA is expected to grow 9%, which is a significant achievement in the field of 5G technology stocks. But analysts expect that the rate could be higher for several reasons. These include the expected buyout of a large volume of TMUS and the results of deals with Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY).\n\nThe 2020 acquisition of Sprint expanded the company’s 5G spectrum. This gave it an advantage over other market participants and increased the number of ways T-Mobile could make money, which couldn’t but influence customer growth. The company predicts that the number of 5G fixed broadband subscribers will increase to 7-8 million by 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Julia Magas did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1.\r\n\r\nThe company expects the December quarter’s (first-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, net sales declined 5.5% year over year to $117.15 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $117.62 billion, indicating growth of 0.40% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.09 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating an 11.17% increase from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nApple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, missing once, the earnings surprise being 3.47% on average.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\niPhone Revenues to Benefit From New Models\n\nApple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.9% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales decreased 0.7% year over year to $43.805 billion.\r\n\r\nApple expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis. Our model estimates for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $66.68 billion, up 1.4% year over year.\r\n\r\nApple is expected to have shipped roughly 72.3 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.\r\n\r\nPer the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 24% in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023, beating Samsung’s 17%, driven by new iPhone launches - iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\r\n\r\nHowever, iPhone sales are expected to have suffered from weak demand in the Chinese market due to lower demand amid stiff competition from Huawei and a ban on usage by government officials.\n\nStory continues\n\nServices Growth to Accelerate in Q1\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, Services revenues grew 16.3% from the year-ago quarter to $22.31 billion and accounted for 24.9% of sales.\r\n\r\nAn expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices.\r\n\r\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.\r\n\r\nServices like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.\r\n\r\nApple TV+ has been gaining recognition due to its strong content. Apple’s impressive run at the award shows has been instrumental in driving recognition of Apple TV+ in the saturated streaming market currently dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN Prime Video, Netflix NFLX and Disney’s DIS Disney+.\r\n\r\nConsumption of Apple TV+ doubled in 2023, per a report from Deadline cited by 9TO5 Mac. Total viewership surged 42% year over year.\r\n\r\nMovies and shows like The Family Plan, The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry, Messi Meets America, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Silo, Hijack, Bad Sisters and Ted Lasso drove consumption.\r\n\r\nHowever, higher viewership has not essentially turned into a market share leadership for Apple TV+. According to 9TO5Mac, which cited a JustWatch report, Amazon Prime Video was #1 in terms of market share (22%) in the United States, trailed by Netflix (21%). Max, Disney+ and Hulu had 15%,12% and 11% market share, respectively. Apple TV+’s market share increased from 6% to 7%.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for fiscal first-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $22.65 billion, indicating 9.1% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "The stock market is still all about tech.\n\nNew data from FactSet shows that while strategists have called for a broadening out of the market rally, big tech companies are expected to be the drivers of Q4 earnings growth in the S&P 500.\n\nEarnings for Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to grow a combined 53.7% in the fourth quarter. The other 494 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see a 10.5% decline.\n\nFive of those companies —Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta — are set to report quarterly results this week.\n\nAfter the remaining Magnificent Seven tech stock, Tesla (TSLA), disappointed with its report, Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nThe expectations for some names are massive. Nvidia is expected to grow earnings per share by more than 400% compared to the same period a year prior. Analysts project Meta's earnings per share to grow 175% from the same period a year prior.\n\nThe eye-popping growth for some of the largest stocks in the market is expected to continue next quarter, too. A second chart from FactSet shows that Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are expected to grow earnings by nearly 80% in the first quarter of 2024. The other 496 companies, including Apple Microsoft and Tesla, are expected to grow earnings by a combined 0.3%.\n\n\"Their earnings are incredible compared to the rest of the market,\" JJ Kinahan, IG North America's CEO told Yahoo Finance Live. \"You don't often see this where a few stocks are so outperforming the rest of the market.\"\n\nTo some on Wall Street, these massive earnings expectations help explain why the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs and still might not be overvalued.\n\n\"There's more growth in that [S&P 500] valuation now than there used to be,\" Pettit said, nodding to the increased position of technology in the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the market's recent rally, nearly 90% of the growth seen in January has also been driven by the same tech companies excluding Tesla, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. This comes after the seven tech companies were the major market driver in 2023, and it creates a simple reason for why investors will be watching these reports closely.\n\nStill tech earnings expectations go beyond just the quarterly numbers. It's about updates on various market-moving narratives during earnings calls, too.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been at the center of earnings improvements for Meta and Nvidia. Microsoft and Amazon both have AI plays, too, but their cloud revenues are typically more closely scrutinized. Additionally, Apple's products business can provide a lens into demand for hardware and the overall state of consumer spending.\n\nAll of this combines to make tech earnings crucial for the market — not only because people expect Big Tech to do well but because if their results miss estimates, the lagging parts of their business could be a flashing a warning sign about an economic slowdown.

Novotney, still listed on LinkedIn as vice president-engineering at Apple, will become senior vice president of vehicle programs at Rivian, reporting to CEO RJ Scaringe.\n\nRivian stock is up 4% in early trading this morning after rising 1% over the weekend. Its market capitalization is about $14.5 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNo Apple Car?\n\nIn a memo released as he left, Novotney said, “Apple has been my life.” He worked on a variety of products at the company, including the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Watch.\n\nNovotney is the second Apple Car executive this month to leave for Rivian, a start-up with ties to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Earlier, Jonas Reinke, who had been with Apple for four years, joined Rivian as vice president of product management. Reinke will now work on Rivian’s in-car software. Rivian bought a Swedish route-planning company, Iternio, last year.\n\nThe executive moves may say more about Apple than Rivian. The Apple Car was originally expected to be released this year. Then, it was 2026. Now, that date has recently been moved back to 2028.\n\nApple is the second Cloud Czar to move away from the auto sector. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) went through three layoffs at its Waymo division last year.\n\nThe movement toward self-driving cars has taken numerous hits lately. Accidents have led to General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) Cruise unit being investigated by several federal agencies.\n\nRivian is best known for its high-end R1T truck and 100,000-unit Amazon delivery van contract. Scaringe said last week he is trying to expand the product line. The company is focusing that effort on a Georgia factory that is due for completion in 2026.\n\nRIVN Stock: What Happens Next?\n\nDrivers should keep both hands on the wheel. Investors might want to keep both hands in their pockets as the electric vehicle (EV) shakeout continues.

All of the forecast numbers are expected to tick down in the labor market, aside from the Unemployment Rate, which is expected to lift back up slightly to 3.8%.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our new week also features several marquee names of the Tech industry reporting earnings: Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL on Tuesday, Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN on Thursday — all after the closing bell, as per normal. These major firms are all expecting growth on both top and bottom lines, year over year, led by anticipated earnings growth of +285% from Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Amazon, and +15% revenues growth year over year from Zacks Rank #2-rated Microsoft. (In other news, Amazon is no longer pursuing the acquisition for iRobot, citing antitrust issues, sending the smaller stock down -20% at this hour.)\r\n\r\nElsewhere, there will be a bevy of other reports hitting the tape this week, from Case-Shiller home prices to Consumer Confidence to Q4 Productivity to S&P and ISM Manufacturing. We also look for fresh Q4 earnings reports from across the spectrum of sectors, from AMD AMD to General Motors GM to Mondelez MDLZ to Pfizer PFE to Snapchat SNAP and Starbucks SBUX — and that’s just tomorrow!\r\n\r\nOff near-term lows on January 18th, three of the four major stock market indices have rebounded into positive territory year-to-date. Only the Russell 2000 is still -3% from the start of this year’s trading, though that’s up from -6% on January 18th. The small-cap index, heavy in regional bank representation, needs three relatively strong trading days to finish the month in the green, along with the others which are already there.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision to be any factor at all on trading behavior this week. Even among those analysts who still believe — or wish for — six interest rate cuts between now and the end of the year do not foresee one coming this early. Most of these folks look toward early March for the first cut, though this would likely take much weaker numbers in the economy before the Fed would risk loosening the monetary screws.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Big Tech earnings: What markets are expecting this week",
        "content": "Big Tech is next up at bat to report earnings this week, mainly five of the Magnificent Seven components — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nYahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer explains market commentary on projected earnings growth for these mega-cap tech companies.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- And tech is on deck this week. Some of the stock market's largest technology companies set to report earnings. And for more on how the reports may impact markets, we've got Yahoo Finance's very own Josh Schafer to help us give the rundown for the week ahead.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad. So you take a look at that list we just showed five of the so-called Magnificent Seven. And when you think about Tesla's performance a week ago, maybe we're talking more of a Super Six here and not a Magnificent Seven. So really, you're only missing NVIDIA in terms of massive tech companies to report this week.\n\nAnd really, guys, I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market and the fundamental story that we're seeing in the stock market. So when you take a look at the earnings projections for the six companies-- I'm going to say six here because we're including NVIDIA in the graphic that we're showing, but they're projected to grow earnings-- this is data from FactSet-- at nearly 54% year over year for the fourth quarter.\n\nLook at the other 494 companies. They're expected to have earnings fall 10.5%. So when you think about why stocks move higher and what people are buying, you're buying earnings, right? You want earnings to eventually go up. That is the story of the stock market in the long term. And that's why the short-term story of the stock market has really just been these six stocks. This is what we're waiting for. This is what we-- this is the big moment.\n\nStory continues\n\n- This is what we're waiting for. It's a big moment. And then you pair that also with the jobs data that we're going to be getting out on Friday, the Fed decision on Wednesday. I know you closely are following that as well, Josh.\n\nIn terms of investors' view on this, in terms of the big driver of the market or the key thing that traders are going to be listening for obviously a lot of that's going to be surrounding the timing of that first cut. But beyond that, what do you think has the potential to move the markets this week?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. I mean, it seems like overall, we're still in the soft landing is probably consensus and probably to the upside, right, as far as what people are expecting. So anything that doesn't give us that, when you're thinking maybe a really cool jobs report, perhaps the Fed talking about cutting later than people think or being more restrictive than people think, or I do think the fundamental earnings story from tech because of where the overall S&P is at right now.\n\nI did a story over the weekend about the S&P being potentially overvalued and what strategists say about that. Well, they talk about if you really think about what's in the S&P, you're buying future earnings growth, right? And if you get that earnings growth from these big companies, then one could argue the S&P 500 at a record high isn't overvalued, and it has room to keep growing.\n\nSo you get all three aspects this week, right? We talk about the Fed a lot. That can move your major indexes and move things. We talked about the Mag Seven. We're getting that. And we've got a jobs report on Friday because why not?\n\n- So I guess we'll talk on Friday, and we'll decide what the biggest mover was of the week.\n\n- Certainly setting up to be a very busy week here potentially for the markets. Josh, great stuff. Thanks so much.",

        "title": "Seeking Clues to Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings? A Peek Into Wall Street Projections for Key Metrics",
        "content": "In its upcoming report, Apple (AAPL) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $2.09 per share, reflecting an increase of 11.2% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $117.62 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 0.4%.\n\nOver the last 30 days, there has been a downward revision of 0.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Apple metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' to come in at $11.27 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -16.4%.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPhone' will reach $68.64 billion. The estimate points to a change of +4.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Net Sales- Services' at $23.40 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +12.7%.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenue- Mac' to reach $7.77 billion. The estimate points to a change of +0.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Net Sales- Products' will reach $94.45 billion. The estimate points to a change of -2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenue- iPad' reaching $6.77 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -28% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' stands at $23.32 billion. The estimate points to a change of -2.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' of $28.66 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +3.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.28 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -2.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' should arrive at $7.15 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +5.8% year over year.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' should come in at $49.83 billion. The estimate points to a change of +1.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Gross margin- Services' will likely reach $16.79 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $14.71 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have experienced a change of -0.1% in the past month compared to the +2.5% move of the Zacks S&P 500 composite. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), AAPL is expected to mirror the overall market performance in the near future.

        "title": "Chinese AR Glasses Maker Raises $60 Million to Compete With Apple",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Augmented reality glasses maker Xreal is raising fresh funding at a valuation that tops $1 billion, according to Chief Executive Officer Chi Xu, aiming to get out ahead of future devices from Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTraders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Musk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts Amazon Drops iRobot Deal; Roomba Maker Cuts 31% of Staff\n\nThe Chinese startup is raising $60 million in the round, bringing its total to more than $300 million, Chi said in an interview. That latest money comes from a key supply chain partner that he declined to identify.\n\n“This will help us scale our manufacturing capabilities and research and development,” he said, adding that the company has enough capacity to meet demand for its glasses this year but needs the money to fulfill orders in 2025.\n\nXreal is looking to blaze a trail in augmented reality — technology that overlays data and imagery over real-world views. The company accounted for about half of the market for AR-only devices in the third quarter of last year, according to research firm IDC. The larger combined virtual reality and AR market — known as mixed reality — features Meta as the leader, followed by Sony Group Corp. and ByteDance Ltd. Xreal holds about 4% of the overall market.\n\nChi said that his company has the ability to produce between 500,000 and 1 million units this year. The investment should allow for production of 2 million devices next year. The company expects to generate $100 million to $150 million in revenue this year and between $200 million and $300 million in 2025, according to Chi, who said he wants Xreal to go public in the US within two years.\n\nThe 7-year-old business now has about 600 employees and is based in Beijing. The company’s Air glasses present notifications, games and video in a wearer’s field of view. Chi said that Xreal’s products have made gains on more costly technology from Magic Leap Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which sells a headset called the HoloLens.\n\nStory continues\n\n“2023 was a very good year, and the market size pretty much doubled,” Chi said. The company, which said it gets the majority of its sales from Amazon.com Inc.’s website, offers AR glasses for as little as a few hundred dollars. But it believes its latest pair — the Air 2 Ultra — is what will drive future revenue.\n\n“There’s a good chance we can do 50,000 units of Ultra this year,” Chi said, adding that the cheaper models are “definitely easier to sell” and that mass consumers aren’t seeking as many bells and whistles as what they might get on rival products.\n\nXreal doesn’t have plans to get into virtual reality — a more immersive technology that’s used in Apple’s new Vision Pro — but Chi believes his company will compete with the iPhone maker in the years to come.\n\n“I think we’re three to five years ahead of them in AR,” Chi said. “They are catching up, though. So we need to keep up and push the boundary.”\n\nDuring development of the Vision Pro, Apple also worked on lightweight AR-only glasses similar to what Xreal offers. The company paused work on that device because it didn’t think the technology was ready yet, Bloomberg News reported last year. Meta and Google have said they’re planning their own consumer AR glasses for release in the coming years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the16 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nMore and more investors turned to quality in 2023 as interest rates went higher amid the inflation storm. The iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF gained 29% in 2023, beating the S&P 500 returns of 24%. The rise of Magnificent Seven stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a sign of the market's concentration in quality as investors flocked to companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals. But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled \"Quality Minus Junk\" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:\n\n\"We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.\"\n\nWhile the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024. Why?  High-quality stocks tend to perform better when growth is slowing down. A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:\n\n\"Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.\" Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\n\nPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26. From these stocks we picked 16 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n16. Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nTransportation services company Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In October Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) posted Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $1.71, beating estimates by $0.01.\n\n15. American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nWith a dividend yield of 2% and a PE ratio of 13, insurance and financial solutions company American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 42 hedge funds had stakes in American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Insurance company American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was also among our top contributors. The company’s most recent operating results outperformed expectations, as it reported robust earnings with improving underwriting margins in the property and casualty business. AIG’s strategic initiatives also added to the positive sentiment. The company made further progress in separating its Life & Retirement unit by selling additional shares via a secondary offering. Furthermore, AIG announced the sale of its reinsurance business to RenaissanceRe at an attractive valuation, a move that will further reduce volatility in AIG’s continuing operations.”\n\n14. Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) is one of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nEarlier this month, Wolfe Research upgraded Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) along with some other semiconductor stocks as it becomes \"incrementally more bullish\" on analog circuits.\n\n\"We stayed neutral on analog for too long this cycle, since stocks bottomed an unprecedented full year before fundamentals began to deteriorate,\" Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note.\n\nHere is what Weitz Conservative Allocation Fund has to say about Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added a new position in Microchip Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ:MCHP) to the Fund during the quarter. Microchip is a leading provider of mixed signal microcontrollers and analog semiconductors to a broad range of industrial, data center, automotive, communication and consumer appliance customers. The company enjoys favorable product characteristics that help drive strong profitability, and it benefits from several long-wave demand tailwinds such as electronification, automation, and growth in data communications. While Microchip is not immune from semiconductor cycles, its cash flows have been durable through cycles. The multi-year outlook is solid, and we think the company is poised to further boost per-share value growth through increasing share repurchases at discounted prices.\n\n13. Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nHR and payroll solutions company Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) ranks 13th in our list of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to smart money investors. Earlier this month Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) declared a $0.89 per share dividend, in line with the previous dividend. Paychex Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PAYX) board also approved to buy back up to $400 million of its common stock beginning February 1, 2024 and expiring on May 31, 2027.\n\nEnsemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) (3.71% weight in the Fund): While employment growth was strong in 2023, the Fed’s efforts to moderate job growth was successful. Paychex business is driven by the number of employees on the payrolls of its small to medium size business customers. With recession worries percolating all year, the stock was flat on a year to date basis in late October just as the economic outlook began to brighten. As recession worries faded the stock rallied to gains of as much as 13% in the fourth quarter. But in the late December earnings report, the company said that core payroll services growth would be a bit weaker than investors expected. Despite this, the company slightly raised full year earnings guidance as demand for their full service solution that incorporates human resources services beyond payroll improved. The stock finished the quarter up 4.1%.”\n\n12. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 48\n\nIn December, Morgan Stanley published a list of 32 stocks with high free cash flow, high earnings per share growth, and an overweight rating in its U.S. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) made it to the list.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 48 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) during this period was Paul Singer's Elliott Management which owns a $1.7 billion stake in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC).\n\n11. Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 53\n\nOppenheimer recently started covering Builders FirstSource with an Outperform rating. Here is what the firm said about Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):\n\n“The company has a market-leading position in a fragmented industry and should benefit from our optimistic view of single-family housing starts in 2024. Growth in value-added products increases the amount of revenue tied to services and is a positive for gross margin and returns.”\n\nOver the past one year Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) shares have gained about 124%.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Bonhoeffer Capital Management stated the following regarding Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):\n\n“Over the past 12 months, interest rates have been increasing, which has reduced the economics of this strategy; but a large spread still exists if assets can be purchased at the right price. Increasing interest rates has affected the returns on public LBO firms. Some firms, like Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) (described below), have reacted to higher interest rates by moderating their use of debt in their expansion plans.\n\nBuilders FirstSource, a portfolio holding, is an example of a private LBO. Given BLDR’s current valuation of an 11% earnings yield and, more importantly, a five-year forward earnings yield of 15%, buybacks are accretive. The net income annual growth is expected to be between 17-20% over the next four years based upon management’s guidance. This net income growth would imply a 17-20% total return before changes to the current modest valuation of 9x earnings. Below is the history of BLDR’s RoIC and RoIIC…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10. Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nWith a dividend yield of 3.7% and a low PE ratio, Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a notable member of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF portfolio. The stock is up about 3.9% over the past six months.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management which owns a $358 million stake in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD):\n\n“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”\n\n9. Target Corp (NYSE:TGT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 58\n\nUS retailer Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is a key part of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF. The stock has a dividend yield of over 3% and had 58 hedge fund investors as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTarget Corp (NYSE:TGT) is also among the stocks Morgan Stanley is recommending for 2024.\n\nLike Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), hedge funds are also buying Target.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT):\n\n“Other meaningful moves during the quarter included additions to cyclical growers we consider early cycle consumer plays: Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), a position initiated in the third quarter, and Estee Lauder. As earnings start to recover, these stocks and semiconductors tend to be among the first to move. We may be a little early and could see some choppiness in stock prices as job growth and consumer spending cool due to the lagged effects of Fed tightening, but we believe we’re closer to the bottom in terms of economic activity and that both companies, as well as Union Pacific, are well-positioned to benefit as consumer sentiment improves and the economy begins to recover.”\n\n8. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 64\n\nPiper Sandler recently said in a report that Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares have \"reversed\" a downtrend and the investment firm expects more upside to the stock.\n\nPiper Sandler mentioned this in its Technical Research report on SMID Momentum. Piper Sandler said:\n\n“We are optimistic about equities with the (SPX), (INDU), and (NDX) hitting record highs, but waning market breadth is a notable concern. We saw some signs of rotation yesterday as SMID-caps began rallying out of their three-week pullbacks.”\n\nOakmark Fund made the following comment about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\n7. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) ranks seventh in our list of the most undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Bristol-Myers has a dividend yield of about 4.8% and its biggest shareholder as of the end of the third quarter of 2023 was John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $384 million stake.\n\nOut of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 65 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY).\n\nIn addition to BMY, hedge funds are also piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and The Walt Disney Company. We added Texas Instruments as a new position. Bristol-Myers has been dealing with the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid, one of its key products. Although the company is launching new drugs in melanoma, heart failure, and psoriasis it will need additional products to offset the lower revenue in Revlimid.”\n\n6. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nEarlier in January, BofA listed its Efficient Growth Index top members for 2023’s fourth quarter in its RIC Report. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was part of the list of stocks mentioned in the report.\n\nWith a PE ratio of 27 and a 3% dividend yield, PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) ranks sixth in our list of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Insider Monkey's proprietary database of 910 funds shows that 65 funds had stakes in PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as of the end of the September quarter.\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP): PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and snack food company with a portfolio of brands, including Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. The company, through its operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells a wide variety of beverages and snack foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nPEP, through acquisitions, marketing, and product innovation has reinvigorated top line expansion and is now expected to grow revenues in the mid-single digit percent rate for the foreseeable future. We expect this revenue growth to drive margin expansion and free cash flow growth from $5.6 billion in 2022 to $12.3 billion in 2028. Based on this more than doubling of free cash flow and the company’s 2.8% dividend yield, we believe we can achieve double digit rates of return from the stock regardless of the economic environment ahead. We initiated a small position in August.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Undervalued Defensive Stocks For 2024 12 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit 15 Quality Undervalued Non-Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole in 2024",
        "content": "If you've ever wondered why Wall Street continually sings the praises of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett, look no further than his track record as an investor since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s. He's practically doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 spanning nearly six decades and has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 4,504,012% as of the closing bell on Jan. 22, 2024.\n\nHowever, the Oracle of Omaha isn't infallible. Although riding his coattails over multiple decades has been a bona fide moneymaking strategy, there have been some dud investments from him and his investment team along the way.\n\nAs we push ahead into 2024, three of the roughly 50 stocks currently held in Berkshire Hathaway's $368 billion investment portfolio are companies I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nSnowflake\n\nThe first Buffett stock I want nothing to do with in the new year is none other than the cloud-based data warehousing companySnowflake(NYSE: SNOW).\n\nEven though I'm not a fan of Snowflake (the reasoning of which I'll get to in a moment), I can appreciate its well-defined competitive advantages. We're still in the relatively early stages of enterprise cloud spending ramping up, which means Snowflake is liable to easily sustain a double-digit growth pace throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nMore importantly, Snowflake's cloud infrastructure is built atop the most popular cloud infrastructure service platforms. Whereas sharing data can be difficult among competing cloud services, Snowflake members can easily do so.\n\nI'll also add that Snowflake's pay-as-you-go model, which shuns subscription fees in favor of charging customers based on the data they store, is clearly encouraging businesses to utilize its services.\n\nThe reasons I'm out on Snowflake in 2024 are threefold. First, I expect the U.S. to enter a recession at some point this year. I'm basing this on a couple of money-based metrics that have historically correlated strongly with downturns in the U.S. economy. A recession would be expected to slow spending across the board for tech companies, at least temporarily.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, the Snowflake investment story has long been about its outsize growth rate. Over the past three years, year-over-year product revenue growth has fallen from 102% in fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 31, 2022) to an estimated 35% in fiscal 2024. Mind you, I'm not saying Snowflake's growth story is over. Rather, I'm pointing out that its outsize valuation premium is no longer warranted, especially with sales growth forecast to slide to 30% in fiscal 2025, according to Wall Street's consensus.\n\nThe third reason I'm avoiding Snowflake in 2024 is its valuation. It's currently valued at a multiple of 176 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for the coming fiscal year, with a slowing growth rate. While I'm willing to afford Snowflake some level of valuation premium for its competitive advantages, this is excessive.\n\nKraft Heinz\n\nThe second Warren Buffett stock I won't be touching with a 10-foot pole in 2024 is brand-name packaged foods and condiments company Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC). You'll note that I'm not just picking on growth stocks.\n\nSimilar to Snowflake, Kraft Heinz does have a few redeeming qualities. For one, it's a consumer staples stock. This is to say that it provides basic needs goods (i.e., food) that consumers will buy regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy performs. Consumer staples stocks are typically known for their market-topping dividend yields and somewhat consistent operating cash flow.\n\nSomething else Kraft Heinz brings to the table is its portfolio of well-known brands. In addition to the obvious, Kraft and Heinz, it's behind popular brands like Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Jell-O, Philadelphia, and Kool-Aid. Brand-name products give Kraft Heinz the confidence to raise its prices and stay ahead of the inflationary curve.\n\nHowever, these competitive edges for Kraft Heinz are trumped by two big concerns.\n\nTo begin with, the company's operating results show a multiquarter decline in volume/mix. This suggests that consumers are becoming more price-sensitive in the wake of historically high inflation and have begun to trade down to cheaper store-branded goods. Although Kraft Heinz has enjoyed exceptional pricing power, a decline in volume/mix implies a challenging growth environment.\n\nThe other issue for Kraft Heinz is the company's debt- and goodwill-laden balance sheet. It closed out September with $19.9 billion in long-term debt, compared to $1.05 billion in cash and cash equivalents. While it remains cash-flow positive, there's not a lot of capital left over for Kraft Heinz to reignite interest in its brands.\n\nIt's also lugging around $30.3 billion in goodwill, which could be written down in a similar fashion to the $15.4 billion writedown taken in February 2019.\n\nDespite a reasonably low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12, Kraft Heinz's balance sheet and stagnant growth make it an easy stock to avoid in the new year. Image source: Apple.\n\nApple\n\nThe third Warren Buffett stock I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole in 2024 is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). It's also the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio -- over 48% of invested assets -- so please don't forward this article to the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nTo keep with the theme, Apple brings plenty of sustained operating advantages to the table. It's consistently viewed as the world's most valuable brand and has an exceptionally loyal following of customers. But Apple's biggest advantage is steeped in its innovation.\n\nIt's consistently accounted for around half of all U.S. smartphone market share since introducing 5G-capable versions of its iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020. Further, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady transformation of Apple into a platforms company. A subscription-driven operating model should lift the company's operating margin, smooth out revenue fluctuations during major iPhone replacement cycles, and keep consumers loyal to the company's ecosystem of products and services.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention Apple's market-leading capital-return program as well. It's repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since introducing a share buyback program in 2013. A declining outstanding share count has had a positive impact on the company's earnings per share (EPS).\n\nThe problem with Apple and the primary reason I'm not touching this stock in 2024 is that its growth engine has stalled. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), sales for all its physical product segments (iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Wearables) fell from the prior-year period.\n\nWhat's even more noteworthy about this decline is that Apple's nearly 3% year-over-year sales slump occurred with inflation well above its historic average. Despite the incredible brand loyalty of its customers, Apple's sales still declined in fiscal 2023.\n\nIt's a similar story for Apple's profits. Although EPS crept higher by a penny, thanks to the company's aggressive share repurchase program, net income fell $2.8 billion to $97 billion.\n\nThe investment thesis for Apple has always hinged on a brand-name company delivering outsize growth for its size. It's why investors haven't batted an eye when paying 20 or 25 times forward-year earnings for one of the largest publicly traded companies. But without its trademark growth, Apple's forward year P/E of 27 is historically high.\n\nAlthough Warren Buffett's company has made a veritable fortune investing in Apple, I don't expect 2024 to be a particularly good year for the tech giant.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Snowflake wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In a recent incident, an iPhone user managed to recover their stolen device from an EcoATM kiosk at Walmart Inc., thanks to Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"Find My\" app’s location tracking feature.\n\nWhat Happened: A user posted on Reddit that their iPhone 15 was stolen at their workplace. The thief turned off the device, making it untraceable. Assuming the phone was lost for good, the user settled their old phone’s dues and bought a new one.\n\nThe next day, the “Find My” app started displaying the phone’s changing locations. Eventually, the device’s location was traced to a nearby Walmart. The user and a friend went to the store and began looking for the phone.\n\nSee Also: Lost Your iPhone And Receiving Weird Texts To Unlock It? Here’s What You Need To Do\n\nThe stolen iPhone was finally found in Walmart's EcoATM kiosk, which purchases used phones for cash. After contacting the local police, the user retrieved the device from the machine.\n\nWhy It Matters: This incident underscores the effectiveness of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) “Find My” app, despite previous reports of it leading iPhone owners on a wild goose chase. In April 2023, multiple iPhone owners were led to a single Texas address due to alleged faulty Maps data.\n\nThe utility of the “Find My” feature extends beyond iPhones.

        "title": "Investors see Microsoft's stock market value leaving Apple behind",
        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Microsoft's early lead in artificial intelligence has the software heavyweight's stock market value poised to pull decisively ahead of Apple's over the next five years, 13 institutional investors unanimously agreed ahead of the tech titans' quarterly results this week.\n\nMicrosoft's shares have surged 7% so far in 2024, recently sending its stock market value above $3 trillion and dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company. As of Friday, the Redmond, Washington software maker's market capitalization was a few billion dollars above Apple's. Asked which would be more valuable five years from now, all 13 investments strategists and portfolio managers consulted by Reuters last week said they expect Microsoft to outpace Apple. Share prices and valuations could shift this week as Microsoft reports its quarterly results on Tuesday, followed by Apple on Thursday. In the long term, though, all the investors consulted by Reuters said Microsoft's recent successes in generative AI give it a powerful advantage over Apple.\n\nStill, the race between Apple and Microsoft could turn into a race for second place, some said, citing the huge recent gains by Nvidia, whose chips have powered the AI revolution.Microsoft made early investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and is incorporating generative AI technology across its business. AI is likely to benefit Microsoft's cloud-computing offerings as it competes with Amazon and Alphabet in that burgeoning market. In its applications business, Outlook now offers users AI help composing emails.\n\nMicrosoft \"has more levers to pull in the forms of Azure cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and of course, AI is the most compelling,\" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management. \"Apple is most reliant on the iPhone, which is a mature market, and the company has yet to detail how it will compete in the AI arms race.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has been quietly incorporating AI into product functions, such as snapping better iPhone photos, but investors will want to hear more AI plans when the company reports its December quarter results. They also will be watching China, where demand for iPhones has slumped due to a slow economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and as a resurgent Huawei erodes the Cupertino, California company's market share.\n\nApple starts sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset in the U.S. on Friday, its most expensive bet in more than a decade. Since Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007, Apple's stock has surged more than 4,300%, helping Apple eclipse Exxon Mobil in 2011 as Wall Street's most valuable company and making it a cornerstone investment of portfolio managers trying to outperform the S&P 500.\n\nWith investors worried about soft demand for iPhones in China, Apple's stock is flat so far in 2024, underperforming the S&P 500's nearly 2.5% rise as well as the 7% surge in Microsoft shares this year.\n\nMicrosoft's shares also rallied 57% rally in 2023 thanks to its lead in generative AI. Its stock is now trading at 33 times expected earnings, compared a forward PE of 28 for Apple and around 20 for the S&P 500, according to LSEG.\n\n\"These are quality growth companies ... but in order to warrant these valuations, they need to continue to grow at aggressive clips. You're going to need increases in productivity, and I think Microsoft is better poised than Apple to do so,\" said Mike Dickson, head of research at Horizon Investments.\n\nFifty Wall Street analysts recommend buying Microsoft shares, while four analysts have neutral ratings and none recommend selling, according to LSEG data. Apple has 26 positive analyst ratings and 12 neutral ratings, while two analysts recommend selling, including a downgrade to \"underweight\" by Barclays this month due to worries about \"lackluster\" iPhone sales.\n\nNvidia, now the most valuable chipmaker after its shares more than tripled last year, may also be a contender for the world's most valuable company in the next few years, said Wayne Kaufman, Chief Market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. After hitting record highs last week, Nvidia's market capitalization reached over $1.5 trillion making it Wall Street's fifth most valuable company, less than $200 billion behind Amazon. \"I have told our brokers and clients that Nvidia is like Microsoft in the early 90s and Intel in the early 80s,\" Kaufman said.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "title": "What AI can't do at work",
        "content": "AI still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs — the human touch. (Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nArtificial intelligence is now a part of our everyday lives and many of us use and encounter AI without even thinking about it. We ask Alexa to play music or check a recipe, Siri organises our calendars and Facebook, Instagram and X use the technology to decide which social media posts — or adverts — to show us.\n\nThe development of accessible tools like ChatGPT has also led to the integration of AI in the workplace. AI’s ability to analyse huge amounts of data and recognise patterns allows it to imitate human function and to problem-solve, reason, learn, perceive and carry out day-to-day admin tasks. Understandably, this had led to concerns about its potential to surpass human capacity in certain areas.\n\nAI may be capable of creating images and text, hiring, predicting trends and making financial decisions, but it’s important to remember its limitations. While the tech will undoubtedly bring a whole host of support and capabilities to our workplaces, it is essential to understand that it won’t completely replace humans — at least not yet, anyway.\n\nRead more: How AI could help us move to a four-day work week\n\nIt still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs — the human touch.\n\nAI can't empathise\n\n“AI has been a great tool to assist with data analysis and automation, but it lacks the genuine empathy and practical common sense in various aspects of work and life,” says careers expert Deirdre Orr. “The ability to understand emotions, navigate complex social dynamics, and make nuanced decisions based on context and experience sets humans apart in ways that AI cannot fully emulate.”\n\nEmpathy, the ability to see another person’s perspective and appreciate their point of view, is a powerful tool. Research suggests that the genuine feeling and expression of empathy has far-reaching effects in our personal and professional lives, and has been linked to better physical health, the maintenance of cognitive function, happiness, resilience, resistance to burnout and better relationships.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has also been associated with professional success, putting pay to the idea of ‘looking after number one’. In a 14-year study from the University of California-Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, those who were generous and agreeable were more likely to be promoted to a position of power.\n\nEmpathy can also increase sales and investment opportunities too, as being empathic can help people better understand the motivation of clients, customers and investors.\n\nRead more: Should you use AI to write your cover letter?\n\n“Empathy and common sense are invaluable assets in the workplace, each offer very unique qualities that AI cannot replicate,” says Orr. “They enhance collaboration, reduce conflicts, and boost employee engagement. Furthermore, these qualities stimulate innovation, improve customer relations, and aid in sound decision-making.”\n\nEssentially, empathy softens negative emotions — something that AI can’t do. Of course, this is less important if all jobs were to become automated overnight, but research suggests this is unlikely to happen any time soon. In healthcare the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial. (PhonlamaiPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nAI in the workplace\n\nWhile the new technology is likely to disrupt our workplaces, it will do so by taking on our admin-heavy tasks instead of replacing us completely. In part, a recent MIT study found, this is because AI is too expensive.\n\nThere are jobs in which empathy is even more important. Artificial Intelligence has been making significant strides in healthcare, from diagnosis to treatment and research. It has been rightly hailed as a game-changer, but its lack of an ability to empathise is its achilles heel. In healthcare — and particularly mental healthcare — the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial.\n\nFor people in distress, human connection and meaningful relationships are key components of recovery — so much so that compassion is an irreplaceable part of a therapeutic relationship. Having an empathic connection with a doctor, nurse or therapist builds trust, which can encourage compliance with treatments and help patients cope with difficult diagnoses. This is something AI simply can’t replicate and even if we were to create tech that mimics empathy and compassion, it would raise serious ethical problems.\n\nRead more: Will AI make us even lonelier at work?\n\nAnd, Orr adds, there are other problems with relying too heavily on AI. “It is limited in the workplace when it comes to actual ethical decision making,” she explains. “Moral judgement comes from within a human, so when it's time to fully assess a situation and issue a complex decision it would be very difficult for AI to provide a response that is fair, ethical, and unbiased.”\n\nA good example is discrimination in recruitment. AI can scan job applications and vet applicants quickly and effectively, making what is notoriously a time-consuming process much more streamlined. But, the decisions made by AI are shaped by the initial data it receives. So if the underlying data is unfair, skewed or discriminatory, the resulting algorithms can perpetuate bias, potentially contributing to widespread inequality.\n\n“AI just can't replicate or navigate the complex nuances of various human aspects in the workplace,” says Orr. “Also, AI is very limited when it comes to customer service. It can understand most simple commands and requests, but AI bots truly struggle to offer employees, customers and clients the personalised touch that is needed to provide exemplary customer service.”\n\nWatch: Accenture CTO explains how AI will aid businesses, new jobs</p>\\n<p>Accenture (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACN?p=ACN\\\">ACN</a>) Chief Technology Officer Paul Daugherty joins Yahoo Finance for the latest installment of its <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/live/ai-revolution\\\"><em>AI Revolution special</em></a> to help discuss the data and the ways workplace AI may effectively be incorporated into many business models to benefit workers.</p>\\n<p>Daugherty explains that the advent of AI is like nothing before, and so businesses will need to revolutionize how they approach work: \\\"We believe what's happening, what needs to happen, is companies need to re-invent work itself and how it happens. That then changes the role that people have. So think about how to develop those new skills — think back to the internet when it came out.

        "title": "Earnings, Fed this week; Evergrande ordered to liquidate - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were subdued on Monday, with markets preparing for a busy week of major earnings and central bank policy announcements. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among many of the tech giants due to report results this week, while the Federal Reserve will unveil its latest policy decision and deliver closely-watched commentary that could help determine the path ahead for interest rates. China Evergrande (HK:3333) is ordered to liquidate, starting a new and possibly lengthy chapter for the heavily indebted property developer.\n\n1. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around both sides of the flatline on Monday, as traders geared up for a week of key corporate earnings and central bank decisions.\n\nBy 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 55 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 19 points or 0.1%.\n\nA solid start to the new year for the main averages on Wall Street will likely face a stern exam in the coming days. Investors will be parsing through numbers from some of America's largest businesses and digesting influential commentary from the Federal Reserve, both of which may help clarify the outlook for the broader economy (see below).\n\nThe S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% on Friday, leaving the benchmark index near all-time highs, a move that reflects market hopes that inflation may be cooling without a meltdown in growth -- a scenario commonly referred to as a \"soft landing.\" The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also fell by 0.4% to end the prior trading week, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%.\n\n2. Big-name earnings ahead\n\nA parade of high-profile and possibly market-moving results are due out from a string of companies this week, including many of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have powered a recent surge in equities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft will report after the bell, only days after the tech giant's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which like Microsoft has been a beneficiary of a wave of hype around artificial intelligence, will also unveil its latest numbers following the close of markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday will feature semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), with investors on the lookout for the San Diego-based group's view of the year ahead for chipmaking. Quarterly figures are also due from Boeing (NYSE:BA), the embattled planemaker who has come under fresh scrutiny following a dangerous mid-flight blowout on one of its 737 Max 9 models earlier this month, as well as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), the Danish drugmaker behind the popular weight loss medication Wegovy.\n\nMore megacap tech firms are set to step into the limelight on Thursday, including iPhone-maker Apple, e-commerce behemoth Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\n3. Fed decision in focus\n\nMarkets will also be keeping their eye on the Federal Reserve, as the world's most influential central bank holds its latest two-day policy meeting.\n\nFed officials are tipped to keep interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs following the gathering on Wednesday, placing extra focus on any comments regarding the outlook for borrowing costs in the near term.\n\nIn December, the Fed signaled that it could reduce rates six times this year, fueling hopes for a cut as early as March. But several policymakers have moved to temper these expectations, indicating that worries remain that a rapid loosening in financial conditions could reignite cooling inflationary pressures.\n\nA stronger-than-expected advance estimate of fourth-quarter U.S. growth last week also bolstered the case for the Fed to hold off on lowering rates any time soon. Meanwhile, economists expect January nonfarm payrolls on Friday to show ongoing resilience in the U.S. labor market -- although the Fed will not be able to factor this particular piece of data into its latest projections.\n\nHow the Fed sees price gains and economic activity evolving in 2024 will likely influence bets over the timing of the first cut. According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, there is an almost 50% chance the bank will roll it out in May.\n\n4. China Evergrande ordered to liquidate\n\nChina Evergrande has been ordered to be wound up by a Hong Kong court after the world's most indebted property developer failed to secure a restructuring agreement with its creditors.\n\nThe group, which has over $300 billion in total liabilities, has been attempting to secure the deal for more than two years in the wake of a bond repayment and a series of court hearings.\n\nBut Justice Linda Chan on Monday appointed management consultancy Alvarez&Marsal to liquidate Evergrande, arguing that the move will provide some certainty to creditors. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" Chan said in the morning court session, Reuters reported.\n\nEvergrande's Chief Executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media that the decision will not impact the operations of its onshore and offshore units. But analysts have flagged that the liquidation process could be complicated and lengthy, as well as damaging to already downbeat sentiment around the state of China's property market.\n\nShares in Evergrande slumped by just under 21% after the announcement.\n\n5. Crude volatile amid Middle East turmoil\n\nOil prices were choppy on Monday, as traders fretted over increased disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nBy 05:08 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.4% lower at $77.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $82.68 per barrel. Both contracts had risen earlier in the day.\n\nThe attack, which U.S. President Joe Biden said was carried out by Iran-backed militants, resulted in the death of three American service members. It was the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.\n\nIran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns over a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings, Fed this week; Evergrande ordered to liquidate - what's moving markets\n\nSlovakia looks to buy Patriot air defence system from United States\n\nChina's vice premier urges more support for listed firms amid market rout",

        "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a muted fashion Monday, at the start of an action-packed week full of event risk, including the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year.\n\nAt 03:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% lower, while the CAC 40 in France traded 0.1% higher and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. rose 0.1%.\n\nFed to meet on Wednesday\n\nInvestors have started the new week on a cautious note, with the main indices trading in tight ranges ahead of a potentially crucial policy-setting by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.\n\nThe U.S. is set to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.\n\nThe Bank of England also meets this week, and is also expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday, following on from the European Central Bank keeping interest rates unchanged at a record-high 4% last week.\n\nRyanair trims annual profit forecast\n\nIn the corporate sector, Ryanair (IR:RYA) stock fell 2.9% after the budget airline trimmed its profit forecast for the year to the end of March after some online travel agents stopped selling its flights in December, forcing it to cut fares to fill seats.\n\nPhilips (AS:PHG) stock fell 4.4% after the Dutch medical device maker reported another loss in 2023, even though the losses were trimmed compared with the previous year, as it seeks to bounce back from a series of damaging recalls.\n\nBayer (ETR:BAYGN) stock fell over 5% after the German pharmaceutical giant was ordered by a U.S. court to pay $2.25 billion in damages, the highest amount yet in its ongoing litigation linked to an alleged carcinogenic effect of its Roundup weedkiller.\n\nHolcim (SIX:HOLN) stock rose 5% after the Swiss building materials giant unveiled plans to separate and list its North American business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe European banking sector is likely to be in focus later this week as a number of the region’s major lenders release quarterly earnings.\n\nAdditionally, in the U.S., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.\n\nCrude gains on Middle East turmoil\n\nOil prices rose Monday on increased worries of disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nBy 03:25 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $78.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $83.21 a barrel.\n\nBoth contracts rose last week for a second week in a row and settled at their highest in nearly two months on Friday.\n\nThis attack was by Iran-backed militants, according to the U.S. President Joe Biden, and resulted in the death of three U.S. service members, the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.\n\nIran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns of a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nAdditionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $2,050.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0840.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "title": "7 ‘AgeTech’ Stocks to Profit From the Booming Longevity Market",
        "content": "While it doesn’t seem like it when you’re young, aging happens to everyone and therefore, so-called AgeTech stocks should benefit from inevitability. A buzzword for age-related technology, this concept refers to a rapidly growing field focused on developing and applying innovative solutions to improve the lives of senior citizens. The segment encompasses the full range of aging needs, from maintaining health to enhancing independence.\n\nFundamentally, these longevity stocks benefit from simple math. As an AP report noted last year, America aged rapidly as baby boomers grew older and births dropped. And that came about because when the baby boomer generation was born, the cohort represented a swarm of new humanity as the U.S. entered a post-war resurgence. However, as with anything in life, there is an ebb and flow.\n\nThanks to the rise in medical and therapeutic technologies, people have the opportunity to live longer than ever. Logically, that will impact society for years to come. At least from a narrative standpoint, these AgeTech stocks should command longstanding relevance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nOrdinarily, you’d think of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) as one of the top retail enterprises, not an AgeTech stock. However, it’s been moving into the senior care realm. Last year, the company’s Best Buy Health unit – which seeks to enrich lives through technology – updated its Lively plan to better help seniors stay connected, safe, and healthy.\n\nFor a subscription fee, Best Buy connects its senior users with a knowledgeable, caring team to address urgent matters, day or night. Just based on current trends, demand for such services could rise. According to a Pew Research Center report in November 2020, the pace of boomer retirements accelerated versus the prior year. Such a dynamic will continue to “exacerbate” for lack of a better word for years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, longevity stocks can be a tricky element because of the niche focus. Fortunately, Best Buy is a diversified retailer, serving multiple consumer needs. Better yet, shares are available at a discount, trading at just under 12X forward earnings. If you want an AgeTech stock you can trust, BBY seems a reasonable deal.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) doesn’t seem the most compelling example of AgeTech stocks. After all, the company’s products tend to cater to the hipper, younger audience – you know, the kind that are glued to its smart devices. However, Apple’s versatility makes it an excellent candidate among longevity stocks. As well, its ubiquity doesn’t hurt one bit.\n\nFor one thing, Apple has dove headfirst into the consumer wearable technology market. True, that doesn’t necessarily translate to direct relevance regarding AgeTech stocks. However, the Apple Watch features a fall detection feature, which can automatically connect the unfortunate user to emergency services if needed. Further, for years, the tech juggernaut has incorporated emergency SOS services into its iPhones. That’s useful for anyone in need, especially senior citizens.\n\nFurther, a report came out that a doctor was able to save a plane passenger’s life using an Apple Watch borrowed from a flight attendant. That just goes to show you how powerful these smart devices are. If you’re looking for a viable AgeTech stock, AAPL should be on your must-have list.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational technology corporation, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also doesn’t immediately resonate as an AgeTech stock. Instead, the company is well known for its software, especially its Microsoft Office suite of word processors, spreadsheets and other necessities of white-collar life. Also, the company dominates in the desktop operating system arena. If you’re not fluent in Microsoft, you’re not getting very far in this modern ecosystem.\n\nThat said, Microsoft isn’t only about spreadsheets and Xboxes. For example, the company offers accessibility tools for mental health, including people who suffer from bipolar disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. Although mental health risks aren’t exclusively a phenomenon impacting seniors, it’s important to note their vulnerability. Per the World Health Organization, loneliness and social isolation represent risks in later life.\n\nAs well, Microsoft’s latest operating system upgrade features options such as larger text, voice control and simplified interfaces. Combine that with its stout financials and MSFT easily ranks among the top AgeTech stocks. Analysts also rate shares a unanimous strong buy (among 35 expert voices).\n\nTeladoc (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased on price action, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) shares incurred a rags-to-riches-back-to-rags tale and it’s no surprise why. Back during the worst of the Covid-19 disaster, Teladoc – which offered telehealth services – commanded obvious relevance. During that time, no one wanted to be around other people. With telehealth, patients could interact with their doctors in the privacy of their own homes.\n\nHowever, with the fading of fears of the SARS-Cov-2 virus came a quick erosion of TDOC. Once a bright prospect among longevity stocks, Teladoc struggled for traction. Even now, its trailing 52-week performance leaves much room for improvement. Nevertheless, don’t be surprised if TDOC makes a second comeback. Notably, its short interest stands at 14% of its float, which is quite elevated, begging for a contrarian response.\n\nAs for its relevance as an AgeTech stock, seniors may see reduced mobility; for example, many may lose their ability to drive. Naturally, such an obstacle would crimp in-person medical visits. However, Teladoc could easily bridge the gap, providing care at the source. Thus, it makes a strong case for longevity stocks.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT) Close up of Abbott Laboratories sign at their headquarters in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational medical devices and healthcare company, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) offers effectively permanent relevance. Regarding its core business, Abbott may be best known recently for its diabetes management system known as FreeStyle Libre. Featuring a discreet profile with accurate readings, Libre also does away with fingersticks, which can cause pain or discomfort.\n\nNow, (type 2) diabetes is not exclusively a problem for seniors. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, the risk of this condition materializing increases with age, especially after 35 years. Therefore, seniors fall into a clear risk category, making ABT a pertinent Agetech stock. Also, Abbott invests heavily in artificial-intelligence-powered diagnostics and personalized medicine approaches. Both can lead to early disease detection, which is particularly important for aging populations.\n\nPlus, Abbott has a clear advantage over many other AgeTech stocks thanks to its reliable passive income. Currently, its forward yield is 1.99%, which isn’t that impressive. However, the company has increased its payout consecutively across 52 years. That most certainly is impressive – and so is its strong buy rating with a $125.70 price target.\n\nCigna (CI) Cigna logo displayed on a modern smartphone. CI stock.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock\n\nBased in Bloomfield, Connecticut, Cigna (NYSE:CI) is a for-profit multinational managed healthcare and insurance firm. According to its corporate profile, Cigna’s insurance subsidiaries represent major providers of medical, dental, disability, life, and accident insurance and related products and services. To be sure, investors probably won’t get rich off of CI stock. Rather, it’s a slow-and-steady mechanism to build wealth.\n\nFundamentally, Cigna ranks among the AgeTech stocks due to its Medicare Advantage plans, which include innovative benefits such as telehealth access, chronic disease management programs, and in-home care services. All of these services should resonate with seniors and their unique challenges. Also, Cigna approaches the aging population in a holistic sense, partnering with other organizations to provide mental health support for older adults and other vulnerable populations.\n\nMoving onto the financials, Cigna doesn’t exactly have standout statistics other than its consistent profitability. However, it keeps the boat afloat with very few fiscal concerns. As a bonus, CI trades at a forward earnings multiple of 10.76X, lower than the sector median 12.77X. Thus, it’s an intriguing AgeTech stock.\n\nReWalk Robotics (RWLK) Image of a person using an exoskeleton and crutches to walk.\n\nSource: Ivan Chudakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nComing to the last idea for AgeTech stocks, I’m going to end on a speculative note. I’ve discussed ReWalk Robotics (NASDAQ:RWLK) before, which develops and markets exoskeletons that help individuals with spinal cord injuries regain walking ability. It’s a fascinating enterprise, which offers hope for many mobility-challenged individuals.\n\nLooking at its website, the company appears to focus on restoring functionalities for people who have suffered injury or physical trauma (i.e. wounded veterans). However, ReWalk also offers the ReStore Soft Exo-Suit, which represents a “revolution” in post-stroke gait training. Essentially, the platform facilitates rehabilitation for people with lower limb disability due to the effects of a stroke. And yes – age is definitely a factor when assessing stroke risk.\n\nAs exciting as ReWalk’s exoskeleton business is, we have to be honest with each other: RWLK is incredibly treacherous. Over the trailing month, it has danced around the demarcation point separating the literal and metaphorical definition of penny stocks. It also features a market capitalization that’s barely above the nano-cap threshold.\n\nStill, if you’re willing to take risks with your AgeTech stocks, RWLK should be on your radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures were trading lower during Sunday night, as investors turned attention to major technology earnings reports as well as the Federal Reserve interest rates decision.\n\nBy 6:35 pm ET (11:15 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures dipped 0.2% while S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.3% apiece.\n\nThe previous trading week saw all three major indexes rise, buoyed by positive economic data. The US economy displayed stronger-than-expected growth in Q4, while annual core inflation was lower than economists' predictions, hinting at a possible slowdown in price hikes. However, the market's gains were somewhat subdued compared to the rally of the week before, following disappointing earnings reports from major companies such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe upcoming week is set to be eventful, with the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting of the year on the agenda, accompanied by significant data releases such as the nonfarm payrolls, ISM Manufacturing PMI, and JOLTs job openings. The Fed is anticipated to keep interest rates at their 23-year high, with investors keen to discern any signals about the timing of rate cuts this year.\n\nOn the data front, it's expected that non-farm payrolls may have increased by 162K in January, a slowdown from the 216K rise in December. The unemployment rate is predicted to remain stable at 3.7% for a second period, while monthly wage growth is likely to ease to 0.3% from 0.4%. The ISM PMI is expected to continue signaling a contraction in the manufacturing sector at the year's start.\n\nInvestors will also be keeping a close eye on the ADP employment change, Q4 labor productivity and employment costs, factory orders, and regional industry indexes such as the Chicago PMI and Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index.\n\nThe ongoing earnings season will continue to make headlines, with a roster of key companies set to report, including tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and others such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX).\n\nStory continues\n\nStay up to date with the latest earnings results using InvestingPro!

        "title": "A Fed meeting, big tech earnings and the January jobs report: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks closed out another week hovering near record highs as one of the busiest weeks of the quarter is set to greet investors.\n\nEarnings from five of the\"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) — will highlight a packed week of quarterly reports. In all, 106 S&P 500 companies including six Dow components are slated to report in the week ahead, per FactSet.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Fed is set to announce its latest policy decision. Investors expect the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Investors will be closely watching for any commentary during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's conference on Wednesday about when the Federal Reserve may begin cutting rates.\n\nOn Friday, the January jobs report is set for release where economists expect a modest tick down in job additions while the unemployment rate is projected to remain flat at 3.7%.\n\nElsewhere on the schedule, key updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy, as well as the latest data on job openings, highlight the economic side of things.\n\nOutside of big tech, results from AMD (AMD), Starbucks (SBUX), Pfizer (PFE), CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Boeing (BA) headline the reporting calendar.\n\nStocks will enter the final week of the month near all-time highs. After a rocky start to the year, both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are up over 2% so far in January. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up more than 1%.\n\nThe market narrative has shifted significantly since the last time Jerome Powell took the podium in December. Investors aggressively priced in a March cut and then scaled back those bets as economic growth has continued to surprise to the upside.\n\nBut with inflation down to its lowest levels in nearly three years, many Wall Street economists still believe that the Fed will begin cutting in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It is time for Fed officials to take the win and start dialing back the level of policy restrictiveness soon,\" Capital Economics deputy chief US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nInvestor bets are still mixed on when that cut will come. As of Friday afternoon, markets had priced in a 47% chance the Fed cuts rates in March, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Looking out to May, investors believe there is a 88% chance rates are lower by the end of that meeting.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen expects the Fed to change its post-meeting statement to more neutral language about the restrictiveness of policy, serving as \"a de-facto easing bias.\" But he doesn't believe Powell and the central bank will fully tip their hand just yet.\n\n\"Labor markets have cooled, and inflation has come down more rapidly than expected absent a large rise in unemployment, but we don't think the Fed is ready to send a strong signal about its intentions just yet,\" Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell arrives to speak at a press conference following a closed two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve in Washington, U.S., December 13, 2023. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGapen believes the Fed will be buying time to see more data. And some of that data will come in the days following the Fed meeting.\n\nThe January jobs report is scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. And while layoffs have dominated headlines in recent weeks, economists expect any signs of a broad labor market slowdown to remain absent from the data.\n\nThe report is expected to show 175, 000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month with unemploymentticking up slightly to 3.8%, according to data from Bloomberg. In December, the US economy added 216,000 jobs while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%.\n\n\"All told, the themes of improving supply, cooling demand and overall labor market normalization likely continued in January,\" Wells Fargo's team of economists led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. \"Although payroll growth has held up remarkably well recently, there are several signs of further moderation in the months ahead. On net, fewer industries are adding headcounts each month and job openings and hiring plans continue to pull back.\"\n\nAs if the economic calendar alone wouldn't be enough to keep investors on their toes, the biggest corporate earnings week of the quarter will also set the stage for how companies are holding up amid the higher interest rate environment.\n\nAnalysis from FactSet on Friday shows just how much upcoming earnings could drive the market narrative. Excluding Tesla, the other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks are expected to be the top six earnings drivers for the S&P 500, contributing year-over-year earnings growth of 53.7%. Excluding those six companies the remaining 494 companies would report a 10.5% earnings decline.\n\nFive of those key companies — Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Apple — are set to report in the week ahead.\n\nEvercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, January (-9.3 prior)\n\nEarnings: Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) Phillips (PHG), SoFi Technologies (SOFI), Whirlpool (WHR)\n\nTuesday:\n\nEconomic data: S&P CoreLogic 20-city year-over-year NSA (4.87% prior);Conference Board consumer confidence, January (112.5 expected, 110.7 prior)JOLTS job openings, December (8.79 million prior); Dallas Fed services activity, January (-8.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Alphabet (GOOGL), Electronic Arts (EA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Juniper Networks (JNP), Match Group (MTCH), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), Microsoft (MSFT), Pfizer (PFE), Starbucks (SBUX), UPS (UPS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended January 26 (3.7%); ADP private payrolls, January (+150,000 expected, +164,000 prior); Employment cost index, fourth quarter (1.0% expected, 1.1% prior) Federal Reserve monetary policy decision (no interest rate change expected)\n\nEarnings: Aflac (AFL), Boeing (BA), Hess (HES), Mastercard (MA), MetLife (MET), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Phillips 66 (PSX), Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, January, (-20.2% prior); Unit labor costs, fourth quarter (+2.6% expected, -1.2% prior); Nonfarm productivity, fourth quarter (+1.6% expected, +5.2% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ending January 27 (214,000 prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, January final (50.3 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, December (+0.5% expected, 0.4% prior); ISM manufacturing, January (47.5 expected, 47.2 prior); ISM prices paid, January (45.2 prior)\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Deckers Brand (DECK), Honeywell (HON), Meta (META), Merck (MRK), Royal Caribbean Group (RCL), Peloton (PTON), SiriusXM (SIRI), Skechers (SKX), Tractor Supply (TSCO), The Clorox Company (CLX), United States Steel (X)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, January (+175,000 expected, +216,000 prior); Unemployment rate, January (3.8% expected, 3.7% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, January (+4.1% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, January (34.4 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, January (62.5% previously); U. of Mich sentiment, January final (78.8 expected, 78.8 prior); Factory orders, December (+0.5% expected, 2.6% prior); Durable goods orders, December final (0.0% prior)\n\nEarnings: Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Charter Communications (CHTR)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Stock Market’s Fate Rests on $10 Trillion in Big Tech Earnings",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors wondering where the S&P 500 is headed, at least for the next month or so, will want to pay attention to three key days this week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSingapore’s $200,000 Toyotas Fuel Angst Over Widening Wealth Gap Houthi Hit on Russian Fuel Has Oil Traders Recalculating Risks US Fires on Houthi Missile Hours After Trafigura Ship Attack Giuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy Chinese Engineers Are Keeping Russia’s Metal Furnaces Firing\n\nBetween Tuesday and Thursday, five Big Tech companies with a combined market value of more than $10 trillion will report earnings: Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will issue its decision on interest rates, followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference where he’s expected to discuss the outlook ahead.\n\nThe stakes couldn’t be much higher, with the S&P 500 Index pushing deeper into record territory on bets that central bankers are poised to began easing monetary policies and tech behemoths like Microsoft getting more valuable by the day.\n\n“Tech disproportionately moved the market last year and big tech continues to have the biggest earnings power, so the results will be crucial for the markets,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.\n\nAfter a shaky start to the year, the S&P 500 is rising again and on pace for a third monthly advance that’s added more than 18% since late October, when the index hit a near-term low before Fed officials started signaling that rate hikes were over.\n\nThe rally is again being led by megacaps including Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Nvidia and Meta Platforms, which were responsible for a majority of the index’s 24% gain last year as investors became captivated by the possibilities of artificial intelligence services. The so-called Magnificent Seven, which also includes Tesla Inc., just hit a record 29% of the S&P 500 despite a slump in shares of the electric-vehicle maker that’s erased more than $200 billion in market value just this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Booming\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet will kick off earnings on Tuesday after markets close. The two companies are among the best positioned to benefit from the AI boom after investing heavily in the field for years. Microsoft has been adding the features to its suite of software products, and investors are betting that AI will soon start boosting profit and sales growth.\n\nOn Wednesday, the focus shifts to the end of the Fed’s January meeting, where it’s expected to hold interest rates steady for a fourth-consecutive meeting. Traders will be primarily focused on what Powell and other policymakers have to say about the timing of easing. Recent data showing inflation continuing to recede and resilient US economic growth suggest central bankers won’t be in a hurry to cut interest rates.\n\nApple is the biggest draw on Thursday, when Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms also report in the afternoon. The iPhone maker has been dogged by concerns about revenue growth and is expected to report its first sales expansion in four quarters.\n\nWith most of the megacaps in record territory, there are concerns that investors are over exposed to just a handful of stocks, which could open the door for some pain if quarterly results underwhelm.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks were again named the most crowded trade in a Bank of America survey of fund managers, according to a research note published by the bank last week.\n\nNo Protection\n\nStill, traders aren’t rushing to scoop up hedges against declines, according to options market data.\n\nA gauge of projected price swings in Apple in the next three months is hovering near the lowest level in six years. Traders expect a 3.3% move in the stock in either direction a day after the results, which would be among the narrowest post-earnings swings in two years.\n\nProjected three-month volatility in Meta Platforms, which more than quadrupled since its November 2022 nadir, is at the lowest in two years. The cost of protection against a 10% decline in Microsoft in the next month is hovering near the lowest level since August relative to the cost of options that profit from a similar rally.\n\nTesla demonstrated the risks last week after missing fourth-quarter earnings estimates and warning that its sales growth would be “notably lower” in 2024. The stock tumbled 12% the following day, its biggest drop in a year.\n\nMicrosoft recently overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company with a market value above $3 trillion. The rally has made the stock even more expensive, at 33 times profits projected over the next 12 months compared with an average of 24 times over the past decade.\n\nTo Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt, there’s no doubt the megacap trade is crowded. But that doesn’t mean the stocks can’t continue to rally with economic growth slowing and easing financial conditions.\n\n“There’s a good reason for the crowded trade,” he said. “The environment is good for them.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?

        "content": "Police in China have arrested more than 40 people in relation to fraudulent schemes that target iPhone users in the country, whereby people give up their personal Apple IDs to obtain a loan, allowing the lenders to abuse their accounts.\n\nIn a typical example of how the scheme works, borrowers are asked to sign out of their Apple devices and log back in using an Apple ID provided by the lender. If borrowers fail to make repayments on time - usually at interest rates much higher than the market average - the lender threatens to block their device, call their contacts and divulge personal information.\n\nIn a recent crackdown, the police arrested nine groups of people involved in these rackets, covering 41 suspects across 21 provinces. The suspects had made loans to more than 20,000 people, involving 130 million yuan (US$18.3 million), according to the state-run China News Service, citing the public security bureau of Wuxi County in southwestern Chongqing city.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nSome of the lenders had advertised their services using the surname of Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, according to the report. In a June case in Jiujiang city, Jiangxi province, police arrested 10 suspects from Chuzhou city in neighbouring Anhui province.\n\nState-run Xinhua News Agency warned in 2019 about fraudulent \"Apple ID loan\" cases, with some demanding repayments within a week at exorbitant annualised interest rates of up to 2,800 per cent. Lenders had lured customers to the schemes by promising \"no need for loan collateral or credit reports\".\n\nThe rip-off interest rates in such schemes compare with more affordable loans from banks, which have cut rates to boost spending amid economic headwinds. The average interest rate on bank consumer loans dropped to 3.41 per cent in November from 4.2 per cent a year earlier, according to Rong360 Digital Technology Institute, a Beijing-based market researcher.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong Chinese smartphone phone users, about one in five use an iPhone, equating to about 250 million people.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Investing.com -- It’s set to be an action-packed week in markets with the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, a flurry of big tech earnings and the latest U.S. jobs report. The Bank of England also holds its first policy meeting of 2024 while data out of China is expected to remain gloomy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.\n\nFed ahead\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.\n\nInvestors have pushed expectations for the Fed’s first rate cut to May from March following recent strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that cuts may not be as aggressive as expected.\n\nData on Friday indicated that inflation is moderating but consumer spending remains robust, leading to concerns that price pressures could begin to mount again.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post policy meeting press conference for any insights into how officials have been interpreting recent economic data.\n\nJobs report\n\nHard on the heels of the Fed decision the U.S. is to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.\n\nThe recent stock market rally which has powered the S&P 500 to record highs has been driven by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.\n\nA weaker than expected reading could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe economic calendar also includes data on JOLTS job openings and consumer confidence on Tuesday, followed a day later by a report on private sector payrolls and weekly data on initial jobless claims on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nMegacap earnings\n\nEarnings will be a major focal point in the week ahead with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.\n\nWith the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum.\n\nCollectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.\n\n\"There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Reuters. \"If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose\" for the market as a whole.\n\nBank of England\n\nThe BoE is expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday and while it may drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds it is expected to indicate that rates need to remain restrictive for an extended period.\n\nThe latest U.K. jobs report showed that wage growth rose at the slowest pace in almost a year in the three months to November, but inflation unexpectedly rose to 4% in December.\n\nBritain's economy started 2024 on a stronger footing but data last week indicated that supply disruptions in the Red Sea are reigniting inflation in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe BoE raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023, taking rates to a peak of 5.25% after inflation surged to a 41-year high of 11.1% in late 2022.\n\nChina PMIs\n\nChina is to release official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday that is likely to show that the world’s second largest economy remains on a shaky footing.\n\nChina's economy expanded by 5.2% in 2023, but its post-pandemic recovery has been shaky, with a protracted housing downturn, mounting deflationary risks and slowing global growth casting clouds over the outlook for this year.\n\nChina's central bank announced last Wednesday that it was making a 50-basis point cut to bank reserves, the biggest in two years, sending a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and the country's plunging stock markets.\n\nStill, analysts say more stimulus is needed this year to get economic activity on more solid footing.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nUS reviewing Venezuelan sanctions policy in wake of court decision - State Dept\n\nFrench farmers keep Paris roadblock threat as protests endure",

        "content": "Investing.com — Here is your Pro report of the upcoming major earnings releases next week: Apple, Microsoft, General Motors, Amazon, and Mastercard.\n\nApple\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to report earnings for Q1/24 on Feb 1, post-market close. Street estimates stand at $2.10 for earnings per share (EPS) and $118.3 billion for revenues.\n\nRemarkably consistent, Apple has surpassed EPS forecasts in 7 of the last 8 quarters.\n\nOn the downside, however, Wall Street anticipates that the Cupertino-California based giant will report sales of $89.28 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year. This would mark the fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline for the company.\n\nGoing into earnings, our flagship ProTips tool warns of the company's high multiples and weakening margins.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nApple has recently lost the title of the world's largest company by market share to rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reports on Tuesday prior. Insights from both companies' earnings should set the tone for the tech space going forward.\n\nJoin ProTips now for up to 50% and get all the most important market insights at a glance!\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAfter surpassing the $3 Trillion market-cap line last week, stakes are at a high for the Redmond, Washington-based behemoth when it reports quarterly earnings next Tuesday, the 30th.\n\nConsensus is that the company will post net income of $20.6 billion, or $2.77 per share, compared with $17.4 billion and $2.20 from a year before, respectively.\n\nShould the estimates prove correct, it would mark the highest revenue in seven quarters, coupled with a noteworthy uptick in EPS. Investors are confident that the company's pushes in the AI and cloud spaces will help the giant maintain its momentum.\n\nGoing into earnings, Microsoft's Financial Health on InvestingPro scores a 'Great Performance,' with a warning to the company's relative value - suggesting a stretched valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is expected to report earnings for Q4/23 on Jan 30, before the market opens. Street estimates stand at $1.14 for EPS and $39.5B for revenues.\n\nOur ProTips underline General Motors’ strengths, including upward revisions by 6 analysts, low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, strong free cash flow yield, and favorable earnings multiple.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to report earnings for Q4/23 on Feb 1, after the market close. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post an EPS of $0.79 and revenues of $166.3B for the quarter.\n\nAccording to ProTips, the company's multiples appear somewhat stretched going into earnings. This suggests that any deviation from expectations could pose a considerable downside risk.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nIn January, BMO Capital initiated coverage on Amazon with an Outperform rating and a price target of $200.00. Meanwhile, DA Davidson Tesla initiated coverage on the company with a Buy rating and a price target of $195.00.\n\nMore recently, in other noteworthy news, MacKenzie Scott trimmed its Amazon Stake by $10 billion.\n\n*InvestingPro users received these alerts in real time, gaining an edge over the market.\n\nMastercard\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is set to report earnings for Q4/23 on Jan 31, pre-market open.

        "title": "Apple Home Devices, Car Veteran Exits for Top Rivian Product Role",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An Apple Inc. veteran who led work on home devices and helped start efforts to develop an electric vehicle is leaving for Rivian Automotive Inc., marking yet another senior departure for the iPhone maker.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTraders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Three US Troops Killed in Attack Tied to Iran-Backed Groups Houthi Hit on Russian Fuel Has Oil Traders Recalculating Risks Singapore’s $200,000 Toyotas Fuel Angst Over Wealth Gap Reddit Advised to Target at Least $5 Billion Valuation in IPO\n\nDJ Novotney, a vice president of hardware engineering, informed colleagues Friday of his exit, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He will become senior vice president of vehicle programs at Rivian, the maker of electric SUVs and pickup trucks, and report to Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing unannounced matters.\n\nNovotney, who worked at Apple for nearly 25 years, was known as a senior lieutenant to many of the company’s top hardware engineering executives. He was instrumental in the development of several generations of the iPod and iPhone, and was tapped by former hardware chief Dan Riccio to help lead development of the iPad, the people said.\n\n“Great products are what we do best and I have been so very lucky along the way to be part of so many amazing teams that developed everything from iPod, iPhone, iPad, Watch and so many more,” Novotney wrote in a memo to colleagues that was seen by Bloomberg. “Apple has been my life, but now is the time for me to move on and help bring to life a new set of products.”\n\nNovotney also helped bring the Apple Watch to market, having been brought on to the project by Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and former head designer Jony Ive. About a decade ago, Novotney was one of a few executives tapped to kick start Apple’s efforts to develop an electric vehicle — a project codenamed Titan.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Apple Dials Back Car’s Self-Driving Features, Delays Launch to 2028\n\nAmid a re-organization of the car project following continued setbacks a few years ago, Novotney moved on to become a senior executive in charge of developing future home devices, including some in the robotics and artificial intelligence spaces. Apple has explored a HomePod with a display that can swivel via a robotic arm, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nRivian sees the hire as a major coup. Novotney, who is starting at the company on Monday, will be one of about a dozen senior vice presidents. In his new role, he’ll lead product management for products and engineering, making him one of the company’s most critical executives.\n\nRivian’s Scaringe took the head of product role after the previous executive in charge of development, Nick Kalayjian stepped back, Bloomberg News reported in November. Kalayjian is leaving the carmaker this year and Novotney will take on many of his responsibilities.\n\nSpokespeople for Apple and Rivian declined to comment. Novotney didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor Cupertino-based Apple, the move marks yet another exit in the senior ranks. Tang Tan, Apple’s vice president of product design for the iPhone and Apple Watch, is leaving the company next month for LoveFrom, Ive’s design firm, while hardware technologies leader Steve Hotelling exited late last year. Across 2022 and 2023, it lost a slew of other executives in hardware, operations and services.\n\nIrvine, California-based Rivian has been seen as a leading contender among a handful of EV startups chasing market leader Tesla Inc. It makes two consumer models — battery-electric pickups and sport utility vehicles called R1T and R1S. The company also makes a battery-electric delivery van for Amazon.com Inc. and recently announced it had been freed from exclusivity to sell the last-mile product to others.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround American Workers Come Out Winners in a Clash Between Economists Over a Curve Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "The Apple iPad has turned 14. Launched on Jan. 27, 2010, the iPad was subject to jokes before becoming a category-defining product.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder and then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPad as a \"magical and revolutionary device\" that could do everything from browsing the web, sending and receiving emails, reading books and playing games, among other things.\n\nA ‘Magical' Device\n\n\"iPad is our most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price,\" Jobs said, adding that it would create an \"entirely new category of devices.\"\n\nOver the next decade and a half, Jobs was proven right and Apple capitalized on the first-mover advantage — one in two tablets being used worldwide is an iPad, according to data from Statcounter.\n\nApple put the iPad on sale for the first time on Apr. 3, 2010 and ended up selling over 300,000 units in just one day.\n\nJobs announced the iPad 2 in March 2011, and revealed that Apple sold 15 million iPads in the first nine months of it going on sale.\n\nApple has since launched 10 generations of the iPad and, apart from the standard variant, announced Mini, Air and Pro variants.\n\nSee Also: If You Invested $1000 In Apple When Macintosh Was Introduced 40 Years Ago, Here’s How Much You’d Have Today\n\niPad Is Not Apple's First Tablet\n\nA little fun fact: Did you know the iPad was not Apple's first tablet? Under John Sculley's leadership, Apple launched a tablet-like device called the Newton MessagePad.\n\n\"What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes,\" Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said in a 1983 speech.\n\nHowever, the Newton MessagePad was not well received and was discontinued by Jobs.\n\nLet’s look at how Apple stock has fared since the company launched the iPad 14 years ago.\n\nApple stock price from Jan. 27, 2010, till today\n\nApple’s stock, adjusted for stock splits and other corporate actions, was $7.4243 on Jan. 27, 2010.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts stock price today is $194.17, which is an increase of 2,515% during this period.\n\nValue of a $1,000 investment in Apple stock, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices, respectively, from Jan. 27, 2010, till today\n\nIf you had invested $1,000 in Apple stock on Jan. 27, 2010, today, you would have $26,153.\n\nLikewise, if you had invested $1,000 in an index fund replicating Nasdaq, you would have $6,982.\n\nA similar $1,000 investment in an index fund that replicates the S&P 500 would be worth $4,459.\n\nA Multi-billion Dollar Business\n\nSince the iPad's release in 2010, Apple has launched a few other products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, and, more recently, Vision Pro.\n\nApple's iPads alone made the company over $28 billion in its FY23, accounting for 7.4% of the company’s topline.\n\nApple has since expanded the use case for iPads from simple reading and entertainment devices to something that can be used by creators as well. The iPad Pro models are tailored for productivity and creation, sporting a large, high-resolution display and featuring powerful M-series chipsets.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Google Launched Its First Ever Smartphone 13 Years Ago Today: Here's How Much A $1000 Investment Back Then Would Now Be Worth\n\nPhoto courtesy: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article If You Invested $1000 In Apple When The iPad Was Launched 14 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Consumer tech manufacturer Apple (AAPL) is due to report earnings next Thursday, February 1. Notably, waning iPhone demand out of China has worried investors as Apple had a rocky 2024 start, dealing with several stock downgrades.\n\nCFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino breaks down his expectations for Apple and the biggest tailwinds and risks for its various devices.\n\n\"As far as those businesses are concerned, the only one that will probably show growth is Mac because some of the new products that they rolled out and easy comps from a year ago, you will probably see some sharp declines specifically on the iPad side of things...,\" Zino notes.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And Angelo, I want to get your take on another big name reporting next week, and that's Apple. We had tech investor, Dan Niles, on the show this week, Angelo. Not a fan of the iPhone maker. And I think Dan's point was basically-- the argument he made to us, Angelo, is, Why am I going to pay about 30 times for this company where the top line performance is just underwhelming? That seemed to be his core argument. What do you think, Angelo?\n\nANGELO ZINO: Yeah, I mean, listen, the reason you're paying, you know, high 20s on a 20, 25 basis for Apple is because of that free cash flow potential, right? I mean, this is a company that we think, this year, is going to generate about $110 billion in free cash flow. The best free cash flow generator out there on the planet clearly supporting the buybacks and real stability in that overall business.\n\nSo, you know, when we kind of think about here the December quarter results, the two key factors you have to look out for is, one, the services business. That continues to be the main growth driver for this company. You don't necessarily need to see top line growth or significant top line growth to see the earnings growth for Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you actually kind of look in calendar 2023, you're probably looking at about 8% earnings growth on no revenue growth, right? And that's because of that ongoing mix shift towards the services side of things, which essentially is 2x the margins that hardware does. So we need to continue to see good growth on the services side.\n\nAnd then China is, of course, going to be the other big story out there. If they're showing that China is holding up very well, I think, you know, that's something that kind of alleviates some concerns out there for investors and potentially kind of allows the stock to continue to work here over the next couple of months.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: What about, Angelo, how much focus are you going to have about what they have to say about the kind of non-iPhone hardware in the corner-- in the quarter, Watch, iPad, Mac?\n\nANGELO ZINO: Yeah, I mean, listen, I think as far as those businesses are concerned, the only one that probably will show growth is Macs because some of the new products that they rolled out and the easy comps from a year ago. You're probably going to see some sharp declines, specifically on the iPad side of things. They didn't have any new products on that side.\n\nAnd then on wearables side of things, it really is kind of what they have to say about the Vision Pro. And that has the potential to kind of move a couple of basis points on the wearables side of things here over the next couple of quarters, but we're not expecting much on that side of things. So, you know, I'm not looking too much into those type of end markets right now, but, you know, something to definitely keep an eye on.",

        "title": "My Top Bull Market Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "A year ago, the markets were just beginning their recovery from bear times. Growth stocks started to take off, and investors wondered when we could officially call a bull market. Well, that time is now, offering us an excellent start to 2024. The S&P 500 recently hit a new record high, confirming the market is indeed in one of these much-awaited phases of optimism and growth.\n\nIn more good news, history shows us bull markets generally last longer than bear markets, offering our portfolios time to benefit. And to maximize your bull market potential, it's a great idea to buy shares of growth stocks. That's because they tend to excel in bull market environments and times of economic recovery and expansion. Here are my top growth stocks to buy in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a the ideal growth stock because it's a leader in two high-growth markets: e-commerce and cloud computing. The company also is investing heavily in the hot area of artificial intelligence (AI), which is boosting earnings in two ways.\n\nAI is driving efficiency in Amazon's operations, helping it to lower costs. And Amazon, through cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS), offers AI tools to clients. Considering the high demand in this area, AWS' AI tools could keep these clients coming back, boosting AWS' revenue. This is particularly important since AWS traditionally has driven profit at Amazon.\n\nAmazon's recent efforts to revamp its cost structure -- to fight rising inflation and other challenges -- have been bearing fruit. Back in 2022, the company reported its first annual loss in about a decade. But by early last year, Amazon already was reporting quarterly gains in net income, and its outflow of cash had shifted to an inflow. In the most recent quarter, the company's net income more than tripled, and free cash flow improved to an inflow of more than $21 billion. Return on invested capital also has been on the rise over the past year.\n\nStory continues AMZN Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nThese moves should benefit the company in better times, too. Amazon improved efficiency across its fulfillment network, for example switching to a regional model from a national model in the U.S. The shorter delivery distances are driving improvements in Amazon's \"cost to serve,\" and the company sees potential for ongoing progress here.\n\nSo, even though Amazon stock climbed last year, the potential for gains is far from over -- and the stock could be one to excel in this bull market.\n\n2. Carnival\n\nCarnival(NYSE: CCL) had a difficult time of it earlier in the pandemic when sailings were halted, but the world's biggest cruise operator has since roared back to growth. Demand for cruise vacations soared, as we can see in Carnival's revenue and bookings. In the most recent quarter -- the fiscal fourth quarter -- Carnival reported record revenue, and bookings in the two weeks around Black Friday hit an all-time high for that period.\n\nFor the fiscal year that ended in November, Carnival reported record revenue of more than $21 billion and entered the new year with its best booked position ever, taking into account occupancy and price. And this has helped the company make gains in earnings, for example, reporting a narrower-than-expected U.S. GAAP net loss of $74 million for the year and positive adjusted net income of $1 million.\n\nInvestors' biggest concern about Carnival has been the company's debt levels. While ships were docked during early pandemic days, Carnival built up a wall of debt just to stay afloat (excuse the pun). But Carnival has made significant progress here, too, cutting debt by $4.6 billion from its peak, and Carnival says ongoing growth in adjusted free cash flow will help it pay down more debt over time.\n\nCarnival's booking volumes and customer deposits, which also have reached records, are reason to be optimistic about earnings. And the company's other efforts to streamline operations and cut fuel costs add to earnings growth potential.\n\nThat's why now, as Carnival charges ahead in its recovery and growth story, is the perfect time to pick up this stock.\n\n3. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a market giant thanks to leading products like the iPhone and Mac computers, but that doesn't mean the company has reached a plateau when it comes to growth. In fact, three things are set to drive earnings growth well into the future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe first is Apple's brand strength, which helps keep Apple users coming back to buy the latest iPhone or Apple Watch instead of trying a rival product. This brand strength is part of Apple's moat, or competitive advantage -- a key element that could keep this company ahead over time.\n\nThe second growth driver is Apple's services business, which in the most recent quarter reported record revenue. This is because all of those loyal Apple fans also subscribe to certain services through their devices -- from digital content to cloud storage. The enormous user base Apple has built over the years (the installed base of active devices topped 2 billion) now represents a source of recurrent revenue.\n\nAnd, importantly, gross margins on services are higher than those on products -- 70% compared with 36% in the most recent quarter.\n\nFinally, Apple still continues to gain new customers, so it hasn't yet reached a maximum when it comes to gaining market share. In the quarter, half of Mac and iPad buyers were new to those products.\n\nConsidering all of this, Apple's growth story is set to be a long one, and the new bull market may be one of the most exciting chapters -- for the company and for shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli.\n\nBillionaire Mario Gabelli in 1976 founded Gabelli & Co. as an institutional brokerage house. Over the years the firm went through an evolution and today it's one of the biggest investment firms operating as GAMCO Investors. The 81-year-old billionaire has a net worth of about $1.6 billion according to Forbes. In November 2023, Gabelli, while talking to CNBC, said that the US consumer is an incredibly strong position since the overall net worth of consumers in the country has gone up significantly over the past few years. However, Gabelli said income disparity in the US is high. Gabelli named several spending acts by the US government and said while the Fed is trying to reduce the aggregate demand, the amount of money the US government is putting in the system is having an opposite effect. Gabelli then went on to talk about the \"short-termism\" of the market and said while uncertainties remain and we cannot predict events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one can still make money investing in the stock market.\n\n\"You can make a lot of money in the market.. by doing simple things like buying specific stocks.\"\n\nBut how does Gabelli find \"specific stocks\" to invest in? GAMCO in a report highlighted that instead of always focusing on short-term earnings cycles and news, it focuses on true value of companies and positions itself for long-term earnings trends.\n\n\"We want to know everything and anything that will add to, or detract from, our valuation estimates. This method of analysis involves looking at businesses as a function of their assets and earnings power. We examine businesses as if we were owners of those businesses, and we believe that we can do that in a rational way by looking at industries on a global basis. Our investment professionals visit with hundreds of companies each year. Our work is proprietary, bottom up, and involves the full utilization of public resources. We calculate the Private Market Value (PMV) estimate of the business, which is what an informed strategic buyer would pay for a business in its entirety in a private transaction. Effectively, it is the intrinsic value plus a strategic premium. Finally, we look for a catalyst: something happening in the company’s industry or indigenous to the company itself that will help realize returns. A company’s PMV is not constant, and changes as a function of many variables. The objective is to identify large differences between our estimate of PMV and the stock market price. We then identify the catalyst to realize a return with minimal influence from the overall direction of the stock market. It is our belief that we can earn superior risk adjusted returns following this event-driven approach.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn another interview in August last year, Gabelli said that markets go up and down but what's important is that we want to invest in good companies with strong management and valuations. Gabelli said that there are opportunities beyond just the Magnificent Seven. Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned GAMCO's Q3'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks with PE ratios less than 20. We ranked these stocks in ascending order of GAMCO's stakes in terms of dollar value. Gabelli is a fan of undervalued companies and usually focuses on under-the-radar names, unlike many other hedge funds who have billions poured in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n11. Deere & Co (NYSE:DE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nGAMCO's Stake: $69M\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) ranks 11th in our list of the undervalued stocks to buy according to billionaire Mario Gabelli.

The bank earned $1.28 per share, beating estimates by $0.16. Revenue in the quarter jumped 9.9% year over year to $4.31 billion, surpassing estimates by $10 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 51 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE:BK).

Enpro Inc (NYSE:NPO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nGAMCO's Stake: $96M\n\nWith a PE Ratio of under 20 an about 22% jump in stock price over the past 12 months, industrial technology company Enpro Inc (NYSE:NPO) ranks seventh in our list of the top value stocks picked by billionaire Mario Gabelli. In October, Enpro Inc (NYSE:NPO) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.58, meeting estimates. Revenue in the period fell 10.5% year over year to $250.7 million, missing estimates by $21.97 million.\n\nGabelli's hedge fund owns a $96 million stake in Enpro Inc (NYSE:NPO) as of the end of the September quarter.\n\n6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 74\n\nGAMCO's Stake: $97M\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks sixth in our list of the top undervalued stocks picked by billionaire Mario Gabelli as the payments giant has a PE ratio of 17.08. Deutsche Bank Research analyst Mark DeVries recently started covering American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) along with some other stocks, citing valuation. The analyst said the stock is \"priced for greater economic weakness that seems likely.\"\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 74 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) during this period was Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway which owns a $23 billion stake in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).\n\nIn addition to AXP, hedge funds also like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding American Express Company (NYSE:AXP):\n\n“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nBillionaire Gabelli’s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential 12 Best High Yield Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Gabelli Mario Gabelli Stock Portfolio: 10 Top Stock Picks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theBillionaire Mason Hawkins' 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Billionaire Mason Hawkins' 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nOtis \"Mason\" Hawkins is a famous value investor who founded Southeastern Asset Management in 1975. Hawkins is estimated to be worth around $1.8 billion and his hedge fund had about $5.5 billion in assets under management as of March 2023. Southeastern Asset Management hunts for bottom-up opportunities around the globe, with the fund's core value and investing philosophy finding its roots in Benjamin Graham's value investing approach. Hawkins is among the traditional class of value investors who staunchly stick to age-old, tried and tested value investing principles. Back in 2008, Hawkins was asked during an interview how he examines intrinsic value of companies. The billionaire said he focuses on free cash flow as he and his team tries to project FCF for the next seven years, \"put a low or no growth terminal multiple on the business past 7 years, and discount back at a conservative discount rate.\"\n\n\"The second method calculates net asset value by adjusting book values of assets and liabilities to current liquidation values. (For example, real estate is rarely worth the original cost carried on the books, particularly if it’s been held for a long period.) Third, we check our longhand math against a data base of comparable transactions over the last 30 years, taking into account the interest rate environment at the time of the transactions. We mark our appraisal to the lower of the two values when comparable sales and our longhand math differ,\" Hawkins added.\n\nLongleaf Partners Funds, where Hawkins is a co-portfolio manager, is also a notable fund backed by Southeastern and regularly posts its performance and commentary on its website. The fund said in its Q4'2023 letter that it more than doubled the Russell 1000 Value Index, \"almost equalled the tech-led S&P 500 Index and approximately doubled\" its absolute return goal of inflation plus 10%. The fund said when everyone was busy worrying about recession, its team was finding contrarian opportunities:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our research team was busy in 2023. At the start of the year when everyone was still predicting an imminent recession, we saw opportunity as contrarians and improved our portfolio with weighting changes and compelling new investments, many of which have already contributed to the portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we have seen a growing consensus about a soft landing. This consensus view concerns us for the same reasons we were excited to be buying earlier in the year when everyone was fearful. However, we are confident in our ability to keep delivering double-digit returns with our portfolio of competitively advantaged, financially strong businesses with management teams that can take self-help measures in any environment. 2023 showed us that our investment approach can add meaningful value, even in a challenging period for bottom-up active equity managers.\" Mason Hawkins' Top Stocks with Upside Potential\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Mason Hawkins' Q3'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks with the highest upside potential from their current prices based on average analyst price estimates. Unlike many other hedge funds, Hawkins' top positions are not in stocks like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the value investor is looking at undervalued companies that are still under the radar. We ranked this list in ascending order of upside potential of these stocks. We also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors for these stocks. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $149\n\nUpside Potential: 6.43%\n\nBillionaire Mason Hawkins owns a $47 million stake in financial services company Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. Yahoo Finance data shows that Wall Street analysts have set a $149 price target on the stock for the next 12 months, while the stock was trading at around $137.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI).\n\nEarlier this month, Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform from Perform. Oppenheimer's analyst Dominick Gabriele said in his note that Fiserv Inc's (NYSE:FI) \"penetration expectation\" through 2026 is impressive and adds an \"upward upward bias for sustaining high total company margin expansion.\"\n\nGiverny Capital Asset Management made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Turning to our new positions, we have been following Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) for a couple of years now and finally bought a position during the third quarter. Fiserv has two businesses that reinforce each other: it is a key technology provider to several thousand global banks and credit unions. Mid-sized financial institutions need to offer a full complement of digital banking services to compete with larger national banks, but they can’t afford to build out an internal tech capacity. It’s more cost effective to outsource to Fiserv.\n\nFiserv’s other business is, broadly, payment processing: when you tap and pay at your favorite restaurant or retailer, you may be using a Fiserv device. That device, in turn, may connect directly to the business owner’s bank – and Fiserv built out the bank’s tech stack. The synergy here is important. Fiserv can sell terminals to the restaurant itself, but banks may also sell Fiserv products as part of their customer relationships. There is terrific distribution synergy\n\nFor the next few years, Fiserv’s growth should be led by Clover, a payments acceptance system that offers merchants faster transaction times, better fraud protection and stronger operational controls than many existing acceptance networks. While Clover is a clear leader in acceptance, it has a small market share today and could grow at double digit rates for some years. In turn, that should drive solid earnings growth for Fiserv. I believe the stock trades for a low-teens multiple of likely 2024 earnings, an attractive price for a steady compounder.”\n\n10. XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $96\n\nUpside Potential: 10.34%\n\nAmerican transportation company XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks in billionaire Mason Hawkins' portfolio with upside potential.

(NYSE:XPO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our holdings in the industrials sector also contributed during the quarter. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO), which provides freight transportation services internationally, rallied on the news that industry competitor Yellow had filed for bankruptcy, resulting in market share gains for XPO.”\n\n9. Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $45.50\n\nUpside Potential: 15.14%\n\nAsset management company Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ) ranks eighth in our list of the top Mason Hawkins stocks with upside potential.

(NYSE:AMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Also in the quarter, we initiated a new position in boutique asset manager, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG). AMG has a unique business model in which it purchases meaningful equity interests in boutique asset management firms and in return receives a fixed percentage of revenues. The Company’s partnership approach allows for its affiliates’ management teams to own significant equity while maintaining operational independence. We believe AMG’s size and scale allow the company to be the leading destination for growing boutique firms addressing succession issues and/or seeking assistance in marketing, distribution and product development. In our view, investors currently underappreciate the company’s active and alternative-asset affiliate business model.”\n\n7.

(NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Billionaire Mason Hawkins' 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets 10 Stocks with 50% Upside Potential According to Analysts 12 Extreme Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Stock Market Curveball: Apple, IBM, and Netflix Just Split Their Stocks, but It's Not What You Think",
        "content": "I subscribe to a plethora of stock market information services. It comes with the job, you know. Earlier this week, several of these tools sent me a whole lot of news announcements, nearly buzzing that phone out of my pocket. I was in for an eye-opening discovery.\n\nA flood of buzzing surprises\n\nAccording to these unexpected notifications, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) just split its stock. Oh? Maybe they announced it in that game-changing earnings report and nobody noticed? I guess it could happen.\n\nWait -- International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) did the same thing. Then there's Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), and Toyota Motor(NYSE: TM), just to name a few. There's no way all of these giants could have performed stock splits in unison, like a Gregorian chant of Wall Street accounting tricks, without generating miles and miles of headlines. Besides, I couldn't find the same stock-split announcements through my usual sources, which focus on the American stock market.\n\nSo I looked at the notifications again, zeroing in on the stock tickers. And then it hit me.\n\nThese stock splits, all taking place on Wednesday, didn't actually involve the American stocks. Every single announcement was about each company's presence on the Argentinian stock market, at the Buenos Aires exchange.\n\nDon't cry for me, Argentina. If anything, I should cry for you.\n\nYes, Netflix and Apple really did split their stocks this week, but not because their listings on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges were growing too pricey. Most of them may get there soon, and I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see a normal Netflix split someday soon -- but Bank of America's shares only cost $33 each.\n\nThings look very different on the Buenos Aires exchange, where investors must struggle with Argentina's incredible hyperinflation. Here, Netflix trades at roughly 14,700 Argentine pesos per share after Wednesday's 3-for-1 stock split. That's about $18 at current exchange rates. But things change fast in Argentina. In early December, the same stash of pesos was worth $41. A year ago, it was $79. It's no wonder that American companies feel the need to adjust their share prices amid this catastrophic exchange-rate trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe U.S. dollar's inflation rate briefly soared to 9.1% in June 2022. It was a painful jump with game-changing effects on business and personal finance in this country, sparking heavy-handed anti-inflation policies from every level of our government.\n\nThe Argentine crisis is orders of magnitude worse. December's prices were 25.5% above November's and 211% higher on the same year-over-year basis you see most often in American inflation reports.\n\nArgentina is teaching me things about value storage\n\nYou might think the prices of American stocks on the Buenos Aires exchange are a low priority in times like these. However, Argentinians with the means and foresight to invest in these stable value stores have a powerful financial tool in their hands. As the peso loses its value, alternatives such as stocks, physical gold, or Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) become incredibly important. Other defensive options include real estate holdings, cars, or bills and coins in foreign currencies such as the dollar.\n\nThe total value of Netflix, Toyota, and Apple shares on the Buenos Aires market are always in lockstep with their underlying American counterparts, filtered through the effective currency exchange rates and different number of shares. Tapping into your foreign stock holdings (and other stable assets) can keep food on your table when the pesos in your pocket are turning worthless.\n\nThis reminder of the Argentine inflation crisis may not improve my investing strategy by much, but those buzzing notifications opened my eyes to the sheer scale of this monetary disaster. Now I understand why Netflix pointed to the falling peso as a 3% currency-exchange headwind for its top-line growth in the next quarter. And the American situation doesn't seem likely to mirror the Argentine crisis anytime soon, but a healthy reserve of gold or Bitcoin could be a life-saver if the next local inflation crisis is any worse than the recent one.\n\nThese stock splits, initially a curiosity, reveal the profound impact of global economic shifts. They underscore a vital truth for investors: the importance of vigilance in an interconnected world and the wisdom of diversifying beyond the traditional stock market. Diversify, stay alert, and maybe keep some Bitcoin or gold handy for a rainy day -- because when it rains on the scale of a national economy, it really pours.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Walmart\n\nWhen our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX): A Metaverse Stock Investors Shouldn’t Forget",
        "content": "As Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) battle their way into the Metaverse, it’s easy to forget about Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX), a metaverse play that’s already proven how lucrative the market can be, especially for young audiences. Indeed, the Metaverse is more about gaming or work. Roblox’s platform has shown us just how profound digital “experiences” can be and how a metaverse-like universe can connect us in ways we never thought possible.\n\nAs the Metaverse term looks to make its way to the top of headlines (again) in 2024, Roblox will be a stock to watch as it looks to climb out of the ditch it fell into back in late 2021 and early 2022. At this juncture, Wall Street is just mildly optimistic about the firm’s prospects over the year ahead. Personally, I think Wall Street is a tad too cautious on Roblox stock, given the potential for the Metaverse to make a significant comeback in the new year as Apple looks to test the market with its Vision Pro headset.\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine many folks underestimating metaverse plays like Roblox this year. As the company looks to add to its ecosystem in 2024, I can’t help but stay bullish on the stock.\n\nRoblox’s Recent Momentum Can Continue, as Metaverse Hype Can Grow Again\n\nIndeed, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest of the hot tech trends over the past year, and while it seems tough to top, I think the Metaverse could re-emerge as a theme that attracts some of the investors who believe gen AI has gotten a tad too ahead of itself.\n\nApple’s massive user base will begin to explore an all-new medium (augmented and virtual reality), which could prove the successor of personal computers. Whether Roblox will be quick to launch a Vision Pro app remains to be seen, as many firms seem to be holding out in these initial stages. Regardless, I’d not discount the power of Roblox as the Metaverse investment theme looks to heat up again.\n\nJust last week, Roth MKM reiterated its Buy rating on shares of RBLX (with a $50.00 price target, implying 23.7% upside), citing their belief that the year could be “bright” for the firm. Roth analysts Eric Handler and Rohit Kulkarni both like the stock and its “very attractive setup” that could beef up bookings growth from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nI’m in agreement. Handler and Kulkarni really do understand Roblox’s growth narrative. With many growth and monetization levers to pull, it’s likely a mistake to think Roblox stock is destined for another year of consolidation.\n\nRoblox stock has been on a nice run since bottoming out in autumn, with shares now up around 60% from their 52-week lows of approximately $25 per share. Even with the recent 13% correction off 52-week highs, Roblox still looks incredibly intriguing if you’re in the belief that the Metaverse trend could return to the spotlight again while the company does its best to get its wheels fully back on the growth track.\n\nRoblox Has a Wide Moat, but There are Competitors Out There\n\nRoblox’s ecosystem is impressive and acts as a flywheel for growth as more users create content to win over the engagement of fellow players. With many different worlds and experiences available to players, the possibilities of digital places to hang out with friends are virtually endless. Roblox isn’t the only video game firm to implement such a model, though.\n\nFortnite is an incredibly popular Battle Royale game that’s become quite Roblox-like with recent updates. With a wide selection of user-generated worlds and games, Fortnite stands out as a potential threat that could take a big chunk of Roblox’s lunch, especially from older gaming audiences.\n\nFortunately, Roblox is doing its best to stay relevant with its users, even as they grow up. Though industry dynamics are sure to shift with every new industry combatant, I’d not be so quick to count Roblox out of the game.\n\nIn a prior piece, I highlighted the importance of maintaining attraction with users as they age. Thus far, Roblox has done a reasonable job, but whether it can outcompete ever-strengthening rivals for engagement remains to be seen.\n\nIs RBLX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, RBLX stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 22 analyst ratings, there are 15 Buys, four Hold recommendations, and three Sell recommendations. The average RBLX stock price target is $44.74, implying upside potential of 10.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $21.00 per share to a high of $55.00 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Roblox Stock\n\nThere’s a lot to love about Roblox stock as the Metaverse looks to reappear in the limelight this year. Though Roblox has numerous levers it can pull to gain traction in 2024, investors must also keep tabs on rivals as more companies recognize the economic profits to be had in the realm of the Metaverse and its like.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Spotify said on Friday that Apple's new plan to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) is \"a complete and total farce.\"\n\nFrom early March, developers will be able to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and opt out of using Apple's in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30%, under the bloc's new rules.\n\nHowever, developers will still be required to pay a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account per year under Apple's new EU regime.\n\n\"From the beginning, Apple has been clear that they didn't like the idea of abiding by the DMA. So they've formulated an undesirable alternative to the status quo,\" the music streaming-giant said on Friday.\n\nSpotify said it would have to pay a 17% commission if it stays in the App Store and offers its own in-app payment under the new terms.\n\n\"Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple,\" Apple said in an emailed statement to Reuters.\n\nApple faces strong action if changes to its App Store do not meet incoming regulations, the bloc's industry chief exclusively told Reuters on Friday.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

        "title": "3 Key Quarterly Releases to Watch Next Week",
        "content": "Earnings season continues to chug along, with various companies reporting quarterly results daily. The period is undoubtedly an exciting time for investors, as companies finally pull the curtain back and unveil what’s transpired throughout the period.\n\nThis upcoming week, we have several notable names on the reporting docket, a list that includes several mega-cap tech favorites such as Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL.\n\nIt raises a valid question – what are analysts expecting out of each? Let’s take a closer dive into quarterly expectations.\n\nApple\n\nPerhaps the most beloved of the bunch, market leader Apple will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.\n\nShares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year. Revenue expectations have been slightly more negative, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOf course, investors will be focused on the company’s iPhone sales, but Apple’s services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. For the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion.\n\nApple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late, as we can see below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon, the e-commerce and cloud computing titan, will report on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has posted strong quarterly results as of late, exceeding our consensus EPS expectations by an average of 55% over its last four releases.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike AAPL, Amazon shares moved well higher post-earnings following its latest release, with shares continuing their momentum throughout 2024 so far. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been notably bullish for the release, as the $0.81 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has been taken nearly 7% higher since November and reflects growth of a sizable 280% year-over-year. Top line expectations have primarily remained flat. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning Amazon, AWS will likely be yet again a big focus among investors. For the release, the Zacks Consensus estimate for AWS sales stands at $24.3 billion, reflecting solid growth from the year-ago mark of $21.4 billion.\n\nThe market titan modestly fell short of consensus AWS net sales expectations in its latest report. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nLike those above, Meta Platforms is scheduled to unveil its quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has crushed earnings expectations as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates in four consecutive releases.\n\nShares faced modest pressure post-earnings following its latest release before quickly rebounding and melting higher. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been bullish on tech’s outlook, and Meta certainly hasn’t been an exception, with the $4.81 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up 2% since last November and indicating growth of 60%. Top line revisions have moved similarly, as the $38.9 billion consensus sales estimate has climbed 1% over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company generates the bulk of its revenues through advertising, a metric that META has consistently positively surprised on as of late. For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus estimate for advertising net sales stands at $37.8 billion, showing considerable growth from last year’s $31.3 billion print. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is upon us, with a wide variety of companies unveiling quarterly results daily.\n\nNext week, we’ll hear from several mega-cap tech players, including Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, and Meta Platforms META.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Magnificent 7 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks looks at where the market stands after the early wave of big tech earnings reports from the likes of Tesla and Netflix. The episode then explores why investors might want to buy three of the Magnificent 7 technology stocks—Meta, Apple, and Amazon—with their quarterly earnings results due out on February 1.\n\nThe S&P 500 is trading near its new all-time highs heading into the most highly-anticipated week of corporate earnings that features reports from Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and other giants.\n\nNetflix, United Rentals, and American Airlines all surged following their financial releases, highlighting the ongoing strength of U.S. consumers and the wider economy.\n\nTesla was one of the standout underperformers thus far. But Wall Street might start to nibble at the EV giant sooner than later considering the oversold levels it is trading at.\n\nThere is no telling how Wall Street will react to the wave of Magnificent 7 reports next week. On top of that, there is little doubt that these big tech names and the broader market will face selling pressure and pull back down to key moving averages at some point again because that is always the case even in strong bull markets.\n\nBut the last several years have showcased how tricky the market timing game can be and why investors might want to adopt buy-and-hold mentalities. On top of that, owning some of these mega-cap tech giants is likely savvy investing even if it seems far too easy.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (META) shares are trading at new all-time highs ahead of its Q4 earnings release on February 1, skyrocketing 160% in the last year. Yet, Meta trades at a 16% discount to the Zacks tech sector, 10% below its 10-year median, and nearly 70% below its highs at 22.1X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nThe stock might be a little overheated, but it is still trading above all of its key short-term and longer-term moving averages. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nThe parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp grew its daily active user (people) base by 7% last quarter to 3.14 billion, while its monthly active users popped 7% to 3.96 billion, reaching half of the global population.\n\nMeta’s various apps serve different pockets of social media and digital communication, and the firm stands to benefit from ongoing ad spending in a world of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing in its AI future and it could still be a long-term winner if the metaverse dream becomes a reality.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the here and now, Meta is poised to churn out profits as it focuses on steady expansion and efficiency. Meta is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 46% in FY23 and another 23% in FY24 on the back of 15% and 14%, respective revenue growth. Meta’s positive earnings revisions activity helps it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is focused on efficiency and profitability these days and is set to report on February 1. AMZN is attempting to improve AWS cloud computing margins by rolling out more in-house chips, while also working with Nvidia.\n\nOn the e-commerce front, Amazon is boosting profitability through a different fulfillment network structure. AMZN is also growing its digital advertising unit and attempting to attract more Prime subscribers via different streaming offerings and other perks.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon’s earnings outlook has improved to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for the company to grow its adjusted earnings by 280% in FY23 from $0.71 per share to $2.70 and then expand another 36% in FY24. Meanwhile, AMZN is poised to grow its revenue by 11% and 12%, respectively during this stretch to climb from $514 billion last year to $637 billion in 2024. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon stock has soared 785% in the last decade to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 280%. Despite this run, Amazon is down 2% in the last three years vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 27% climb and it trades around 15% below its all-time highs.\n\nAmazon’s forward earnings multiple remains rather high. But its focus on bottom-line growth has it looking lightyears better than it was. Amazon’s PEG ratio might also suggest its P/E ratio will continue to come down.\n\nApple (AAPL), like all of the stocks on the list today doesn’t need an introduction and it reports earnings (Q1 FY24) on February 1.\n\nAAPL stock closed out 2023 on a downbeat note after hitting all-time highs as Wall Street worried about slowing growth in China, a saturated high-end smartphone market, possible legal setbacks, and more. Apple’s revenue did fall by 2.8% last year, but that is rather common given its somewhat cyclical iPhone-heavy business. And the stock is already bouncing back. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEven in a 'down year' Apple sold $200 billion worth of iPhones in FY23 vs. $142 billion in FY19. Plus, CEO Tim Cook has helped turn its iPhones, Macs, and more, which have amassed an installed base of “over 2 billion active devices,” into a separate growth engine via services-focused subscriptions.\n\nThe biggest growth segment at the company includes the App Store, streaming TV, and more. AAPL has nearly doubled the number of paid subscriptions it had three years ago to over 1 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple’s revenue is projected to climb by 3% in FY23 and then jump 6% higher in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 8% and 9%, respectively. Apple trades above all of its key short-term and long-term moving averages and it is trading near neutral RSI levels.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple trades at a roughly 20% discount to its five-year highs at 28.6X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its median and Tech.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Earnings Countdown: Mega-Cap Stocks Take the Stage Next Week",
        "content": "Although next week will not be the most numerous in earnings reports, it will be the most important. Five of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks will be reporting and the two largest American energy companies – sharing with investors some of the most valuable economic data in the world.\n\nThus far, the earnings season has been generally upbeat with the majority of stocks reporting thus far beating both earnings and revenue estimates.\n\nTechnology\n\nFrom the Zacks Earnings Trend Report from research head Sheraz Mian, he notes that:\n\n“For the Technology sector, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +18.7% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues. Had it not been for the strong Tech sector contribution, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index would be down -5.9% (instead of up +0.6% as a whole).\r\n\r\nThe ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ - Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) - will start reporting Q4 results in the next few days. Total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +38.3% from the same period last year on +12.5% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +54.2% higher earnings on +12.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q3.”\n\nWhich is quite incredible when you think about it. We have many analysts and commentators commenting on how large a portion of the S&P 500 the mega-cap tech stocks have become, but the sales and earnings growth they put up is simply undeniable.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the market closes, we will get earnings from Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL, and then on Thursday Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta Platforms META.\n\nI also want to note the valuations on the five tech stocks reporting next week. Although there is much talk of “its only the mag 7 dragging the market higher,” none of them have absurd valuations, and a couple are quite appealing.\n\nWe can see that Amazon and Microsoft have the loftiest forward earnings multiples, while Meta Platforms and Alphabet have the lowest and Apple is right in the middle. Both Meta Platforms and Alphabet are trading below their five-year median valuations of 23.3x and 24.2x respectively and are forecasting EPS to grow 21% and 17% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Microsoft and Apple are trading above their five-year median valuations of 31x and 26x respectively. These are obviously historical premiums, but not excessively high. Microsoft is anticipating annual EPS growth of 15.5% over the next 3-5 years and Apple 12.7%.\n\nAnd finally, Amazon, with the most premium valuation is actually the farthest below its five-year median of 72.5x. Admittedly, Amazon’s valuation has always been a bit of a conundrum, because the e-commerce business runs with such low margins, but these days it is balanced by Amazon Web services, which is the largest cloud-service provider. AMZN is projecting annual EPS growth of 28.5% over the next 3-5 years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nI think that this data can yield a fairly simple conclusion; based on valuations Meta Platforms and Alphabet are quite appealing, while Microsoft and Apple may have to work off their premium multiples before they are as attractive. Amazon looks appealing as well based on its very high earnings growth expectations.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Apple and Alphabet have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.\n\nEnergy\n\nRegarding earnings expectations, energy stocks are on the completely other side of the spectrum from Technology. From the Earnings Trend Report:\n\n“Sectors expected to experience the biggest earnings declines in Q4 include Autos, Basic Materials, Medical, Energy, and Transportation.”\n\nEnergy stocks have struggled over the last year primarily due to the easing of Oil prices. Following the start of Ukraine-Russia war, and easing of inflation, the price of crude oil has steadily fallen from the $130 highs to $78 today, with intermittent spikes up to $95.\n\nThis reflects the cyclical nature of investing in oil stocks and doesn’t come as to big a surprise. But even with expectations of falling YoY earnings, I think this sector is still rather appealing, and worth considering as investments.\n\nOn Friday, US oil majors Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron CVX report earnings before the market opens.\n\nLike the technology stocks, when looking at energy from a historical valuation perspective it is hard to deny the attractiveness. Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron are trading at very reasonable valuations of ~10x forward earnings, easing considerably from the three-year highs near 30x. But they are also below the 10-year medians, which both stand at ~17.7x.\n\nChevron and Exxon Mobil also both pay hefty dividends of 4% and 3.7% respectively and have structural tailwinds.

        "title": "The generative AI smartphone age is here",
        "content": "Generative AI is coming to your smartphone. Yes, the biggest technology trend in years is landing on your most important device. But how exactly it will impact your everyday life is still unclear.\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung are leading the generative AI charge with their latest smartphones, the Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 lineup, and you can expect others to join the fray, including Apple (AAPL), throughout 2024 and beyond.\n\nAnalysts say generative AI capabilities will quickly become table stakes for companies. That will also help tech giants hoping to woo potential smartphone customers and spawn a new upgrade cycle at a time of anemic device sales.\n\n“I think in the not-too-distant future, all phones will have some level of these capabilities,” explained TECHnalysis Research founder and president Bob O’Donnell. “It's the kind of thing that I think … people can just start to expect.”\n\nAccording to analysts at UBS, generative AI smartphones will start off slow but increase in sales rather fast.\n\n“Combining Apple, smartphone and other Android brands, we project Gen AI smartphones to ramp from 50 [million units] or 4% penetration in 2023 to 583 [million units] or 46% penetration in 2027,” UBS analysts said in a January research note. Samsung is banking on its Galaxy AI offerings to boost sales of its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones. (Samsung) (samsung)\n\nSo what can you expect from AI smartphones beyond what your current device can already do? That’s still a surprisingly open question.\n\nGenerative AI on the go\n\nBeyond a few apps and features for existing software such as the ability to improve video calls or run photo editing programs locally, companies are light on details as to how generative AI will change the overall user experience.\n\nOn the PC side, Microsoft is loading its Copilot app onto Windows 11 machines, but that’s a web-based platform that doesn’t require any particular hardware on your side.\n\n“If I compare PCs and smartphones, I think there's much more hope that smartphones will actually start to, over time, demonstrate real value from AI and Gen AI,” explained Gartner senior research director Ranjit Atwal.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to UBS analysts, generative AI-capable smartphones could improve multimedia content creation; enable fast photo and video editing; and provide better speech-to-text, translation, and enhanced gaming capabilities. Samsung and Google are already offering powerful generative AI photo editing and translation capabilities in their latest devices.\n\nLike all things related to smartphones, Apple will play an outsized role in how generative AI technology makes its way into our devices. But how the company does so will be just as interesting as when it adds the feature to its iPhones.\n\n“Will they do it through Siri and then Siri automatically talks to the other apps, which would be a different way of presenting the same capability? Or … are they going to do something else? I think the devil is going to be in the details of how it’s implemented,” O’Donnell said.\n\nHowever Apple decides to bring generative AI to the iPhone, though, it will have a distinct advantage over rival Samsung, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster explained.\n\nThat’s because Apple controls every aspect of the iPhone, from the software to the hardware right down to the chip that powers it all. That kind of capability should help Apple ensure that the overall experience is as seamless as possible.\n\nIt also doesn’t hurt that Apple has been taking advantage of the neural engine in its A-series chips for years to help power a number of on-device machine learning processes. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to Apple soothsayer Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will bring generative AI capabilities including auto-summarization for long text and auto-complete writing tools and add generative AI features to the company’s developer tools. Apple, Gurman says, will debut those features at its annual WWDC developer conference in June.\n\nThat, however, also means that Apple will be well behind Google and Samsung in bringing generative AI capabilities to market.\n\nBut with the full extent of generative AI technologies for smartphones still up in the air, it might not actually matter.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Big Tech Announces Another Round of Job Cuts As It Continues Its Expensive Efforts To Turn GenAI Into Business Magic",
        "content": "According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) hold the highest cash and short-term investment balances among nonbanking companies in the S&P 500 community. Although they are not hurting cash-wise, they are also quite careful about their spending.\n\nAmazon and Google-parent Alphabet entered the new year by announcing more layoffs. Last year, Amazon, Google, along with Microsoft, Meta and Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM), trimmed their respective workforces by 6% to 13%, but layoffs started back in 2022, costing several thousand employees their jobs.\n\nNew Round Of Layoffs Suggests Big Tech Bit Off More It Can Chew\n\nLast week, Google announced its job cuts across engineering and hardware teams as it continues its push for greater efficiency. Although other parts of the tech giant were affected, mostly impacted were workers in hardware, central engineering and Google Assistant voice-activated software product. As it continues to keep up with its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon, Google eliminated about 12,000 jobs last year under the leadership of Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud titan, Amazon laid off hundreds across Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios divisions, taking the overall job cuts to 27,000. Last year alone, Amazon laid off about 18,000 employees.\n\nCutting Jobs To Fund AI Efforts\n\nAlthough it seems like a strange time for job cuts considering that Big Tech ended 2023 by exiting the post-pandemic slump with the recovery of online advertising, Big Tech is in an expensive arms race to build AI services. Therefore, it is not a surprise that Google and Amazon opted to continue the trend of cost-cutting efforts, while streamlining operations and focusing on key projects. But even though this year will bring increased AI spending, its impact on revenue will likely be limited. Although generative AI is expected to pay out big-time, but turning GenAI magic into the desired top and bottom-line business impact will take time. Microsoft gained the early lead in the AI-race thanks to its partnership with the ChatGPT creator, OpenAI, but Amazon and Google are determined to catch up and to do so, they will need to spend their billions wisely.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Apple’s EU app store changes are truly epic—but they may not be enough",
        "content": "Apple on Thursday announced fundamental changes to the way it runs its mobile business in Europe, to very grudgingly comply with the European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA)—a massive reform of antitrust law that specifically targets Big Tech.\n\nBut Apple's move is already facing strong opposition from those who are supposed to benefit from it.\n\nThe changes, which the company revealed with stark warnings about the security and privacy implications for European iPhone and iPad users, will make it possible for those users to download alternative app stores, pay for in-app purchases and subscriptions without using Apple’s payment system, and choose to use non-Safari browsers like Chrome or Firefox—which will no longer have to be built on top of Apple’s WebKit engine—from the first time they turn on their device.\n\nHowever, companies that have long been pushing for the ability to launch rivals to the in-house iOS App Store are deeply displeased with the way Apple has chosen to make the changes.\n\nEpic Games, which has spent years crusading against the massive cut Apple demands for in-app sales, and which intends to launch its own iOS app store in the EU later this year, is the most notable example.\n\nIn a blistering X post, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney laid into Apple’s decision to claim a €0.50 ($0.54) “core technology fee” per first installation from developers who choose to distribute very popular apps (i.e. those seeing over 1 million downloads per year) through alternative app stores.\n\nApple says this would apply to less than 1% of developers, but nonetheless, it would demand that fee whether the installation comes via its own App Store or a rival channel.\n\n“They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under [the] DMA, or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don't process,” Sweeney thundered. (That last point is curious, as Apple explicitly said that “developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple.”)\n\nStory continues\n\nThis opposition could well mean that the changes still leave Apple falling foul of the DMA—which comes with the threat of fines theoretically running as high as 20% of global annual revenue.\n\n\"The DMA will open the gates of the internet to competition so that digital markets are fair and open. Change is already happening. As from 7 March [the deadline for DMA compliance] we will assess companies' proposals, with the feedback of third parties,” Thierry Breton, the European Commission’s digital chief, told Reuters on Friday.\n\n“If the proposed solutions are not good enough, we will not hesitate to take strong action.”\n\nAsked for comment earlier in the day, a Commission spokesperson told Fortune that the EU executive body—which is in charge of enforcing the DMA—“strongly” encourages Big Tech companies whose platforms fall under the law to “test their proposals with third parties.”\n\nApple told Fortune that it was sharing its changes with everyone, and that it had previewed them to the Commission in more than 50 meetings.\n\nEpic won’t be the only company griping to the Commission.\n\nAptoide, which already has an alternative app store for iOS but currently requires users to have “jailbroken” iPhones to use it, also told Reuters that it was preparing to send formal feedback on Apple’s changes. “This was definitely a good move, but the fees are still too high,” said CEO Paulo Trezentos.\n\nSweeney’s complaint went beyond the issue of fees, also touching on the measures Apple said it would take to mitigate the theoretical security threats posed by alternative app stores.\n\nApple will still review all iOS apps, regardless of how they're distributed, through a “notarization” procedure entailing both automated and human review—crucially, it will also retain the right to deny authorization to alternative app stores, “to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and [app] developers.”\n\n“Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store. They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it, for example, or block Microsoft, Valve, Good Old Games, or new entrants,” Sweeney wrote.\n\n“Epic has always supported the notion of Apple notarization and malware scanning for apps, but we strongly reject Apple's twisting this process to undermine competition.”\n\nThe DMA itself states that “gatekeepers” such as Apple will need to apply “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory general conditions of access” for other businesses that want to set up shop on their platforms.\n\nWith such strong pushback already evident, there’s a chance that Apple’s changes may not reach those benchmarks.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Fortnite is coming back to iPhone – but only in Europe for now",
        "content": "More than three years after Epic Games removed Fortnite from Apple devices, the publishers/developer is ready to bring it back, but players in the U.S. will have to wait a while longer.\n\nEpic has confirmed it will bring the popular title back to iPhones and iPads in EU markets following Apple’s announcement that it will enabled third-party stores for iOS users.\n\nA timeline for the game’s return hasn’t been set—and Epic’s much-publicized feud with Apple is far from over. Even in its announcement that the game would be returning, Epic added, “We'll continue to argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law.”\n\nThe key to the return to Apple devices in parts of Europe is the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which (among other things) allows developers to bypass Apple’s app store for payments. That law goes into effect March 7.\n\nWhile it’s enough to get Epic back on board, the game maker is still taking shots at Apple. CEO and founder Tim Sweeney, in a separate tweet, called Apple’s announcement a “devious new instance of Malicious Compliance”.\n\n“Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store. They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it, for example,” he added. “There's a lot more hot garbage in Apple's announcement. It will take more time to parse both the written and unwritten parts of this new horror show.”\n\nEven without a significant mobile presence, Fortnite ruled supreme in December 2023, topping the as player engagement charts on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox, according to Circana. Some 36% of active PS5 players and 31% of active Xbox Series players played Fortnite at least once during December. That was a 5% bump on Sony’s platform and a 3% increase on Microsoft’s.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Five of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech megacaps will report earnings next week, with artificial-intelligence investment, regulatory challenges and waning China demand among the shared themes in focus.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGiuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy US Fires on Houthi Missile Hours After Trafigura Ship Attack MacKenzie Scott Pares Her Amazon Stake by $10 Billion Gas-Addicted Europe Trades One Energy Risk for Another Putin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Seeing War Advantage\n\nAlong with Microsoft Corp., which just hit a historic $3 trillion market valuation, Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are set to post record revenues for the quarter, underscoring the strength of the US economy. Even so, they are likely to be asked about further cost reductions after the significant job cuts they have each embarked on in recent weeks.\n\nApple Inc., grappling with slowing China sales, antitrust accusations and bruised from a patent fight, could give investors a better sense of early demand for its new Vision Pro, which some big-name developers are steering clear of. Boeing Co., mired deep in a safety crisis that prompted the US Federal Aviation Administration to freeze a planned production increase of 737 Max, will face more questions about how it plans to allay concerns over the quality of its aircraft.\n\nMonday: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday: Microsoft (MSFT US) is set to post a 16% jump to record quarterly sales, with TD Cowen seeing strength in its Azure segment from returning cloud customers and rising AI demand. The monetization of its AI-powered virtual assistant Copilot will be scrutinized though the product won’t make significant topline contributions until later this year, Evercore said.\n\nAlphabet’s (GOOGL US) earnings per share is seen rising 52%, with Jefferies pointing to ad revenue growth in the year-end quarter and the ramping up of NFL Sunday Ticket channel on YouTube as driving forces. Its Google Cloud segment should see “measured and gradual” growth as customers prepare for AI deployments, Jefferies added. Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD US) AI exposure will help drive sales 9.5% higher, in contrast to Qualcomm (QCOM US), which is seen revealing a stagnant topline when it reports Wednesday despite a rebound in its handset and automotive segments. Starbucks’ (SBUX US) North American same-store sales growth is projected to about halve to 5.8% from the same period a year ago. Domestic sales were volatile in November and December amid union walkouts and social-media calls to boycott the coffee chain over its perceived response to the Israel-Hamas war, William Blair noted. General Motors (GM US) deliveries were flat in the quarter as strikes cut output at four plants that make the automaker’s top-selling models. Despite the dropoff — deliveries were up 41% the same period a year ago — profit could still beat expectations as US production likely outpaced sales to account for lost output during the strike, Bloomberg Intelligence said. UPS (UPS US) adjusted earnings per share will slide by double-digits for the fourth quarter in a row, weighed down by higher costs from its new labor contract and tepid shipping growth. Investors will want to gauge the firm’s progress on winning back market share lost during fraught labor talks and hear about the impact of Red Sea shipping disruptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday: Boeing (BA US) will see operating profit of $287 million, snapping a five-quarter streak of losses on more commercial-aircraft deliveries and strong services demand. With its growth ambitions dented by the US Federal Aviation Administration’s move to freeze planned production increases for the 737 Max aircraft, executives are set to face intense scrutiny on the company’s next steps.\n\nMastercard (MA US) should be able to raise earnings per share by 16% for the quarter as cuts to expenses offset slowing revenue growth and increased buybacks. Company guidance for 2024 should be in line with consensus, Baird said.\n\nThursday: Apple (AAPL US) may score a modest beat on earnings estimates despite slowing sales in China, Evercore said, noting that a patent dispute involving its smartwatches should have little impact. Initial signs point to strong demand for the Vision Pro headset which, along with AI-driven features on its iPhones, could drive growth this year, Bank of America said. Investors will want more color on its overhaul of its App Store and iPhone features in the European Union to appease regulators..\n\nMeta’s (META US) 2023 ad revenue growth was fueled by Chinese e-commerce platforms but whether the Facebook parent can rely on the likes of Shein and Temu this year remains to be seen, given simmering China-US tensions, BI said. Meta may also need to focus investments in its large-language model to improve ad targeting amid declining user engagement. Amazon (AMZN US) may beat expectations for a low-double-digit revenue gain — consensus calls for 11% — given a stronger-than-expected holiday season and sequentially improving sales at Amazon Web Services, BI said. The addition of ads to its Prime video service, along with its cloud order book and insights on consumer shopping trends, will be in focus.\n\nFriday: Exxon Mobil (XOM US) has warned of a $2.5 billion writedown in some of its California operations in guidance released this month. Gas trading and downstream-derivative tailwinds shored up its profits, TD Cowen said, though consensus estimates point to a 35% fall in earnings per share. Lower oil prices have also dragged Chevron’s (CVX US) profits lower as earnings per share is seen retreating 21% with an LNG pricing uptick failing to offset lower refining margins.\n\nCharter Communications (CHTR US) investors may focus on broadband subscriber numbers after its fight with Walt Disney over fees left its pay-TV customers temporarily unable to view channels backed by the entertainment giant. Broadband revenue could still get a boost from better average revenue per user gains with the end of promotional discounts, BI said. Cigna’s (CI US) earnings per share likely jumped 32%, more than double the previous quarter’s rate, amid a rise in medical customers and a largely stable medical loss ratio. Medical costs, forecast 14% higher in the quarter, is a concern, especially after health insurance peer Humana’s recent move to cut its forecast on higher-than-anticipated expenses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?

        "content": "Intuitive Surgical ISRG announced that it has submitted an application for FDA 510(k) clearance of its next-generation da Vinci 5 multiport surgical robot.\n\nThe company’s da Vinci robotic surgical system family will include the new da Vinci 5, as well as the X and Xi systems with multiple ports and the SP system with one port. It also has Ion, a robotic-assisted device for lung biopsy with minimal invasion. The addition of the next-generation da Vinci 5 will be a significant addition to its portfolio.\n\nThe company expects an approval soon, which will be followed by a launch later this year.\n\nMore on the News\n\nOn its fourth-quarter earnings call, Intuitive Surgical announced that it has successfully completed a thorough IDE trial for the da Vinci 5 in multiple centers, according to Guthart. The trial enrolled patients until May 2023, and ISRG applied for 510(k) approval in August 2023. The company is currently answering FDA’s queries. In addition, Intuitive Surgical is also discussing the approval pathway for da Vinci 5 with regulators in Japan and South Korea.\n\nInvestors have been eagerly waiting for ISRG’s new da Vinci system. The company's shares lost a year ago as there was no announcement of any new multiport system in 2023.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is preparing to manufacture da Vinci 5. The company has moved X system production to its Atlanta hub. Xi system production will also go to Atlanta this year. The company said it will open new plants in California for da Vinci 5 and Ion in the next 18 months. It will also finish moving Ion and SP lines to Mexicali, Mexico.\n\nComparison With Peers\n\nAnother company from the same industry, Masimo MASI, won a favorable court ruling in its intellectual property dispute with tech-titan, Apple AAPL over blood oxygen sensors in newer Apple Watch models.\n\nPer the latest ruling in the ongoing patent dispute litigation, Apple has to stop selling watches with the oxygen measurement feature while an appeal of the ban plays out. Masimo sued Apple in 2020 when the latter added a blood oxygen sensor to its watches, starting with Series 6. Following a three-year-long battle, Masimo received its first favorable ruling against Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nDexCom DXCM, another company in the same industry, unveiled its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Athenry. With the ability to produce millions of Dexcom rtCGM sensors annually, the new plant will contribute to the betterment of diabetes patients throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Dexcom's first manufacturing plant in Europe will guarantee product flow throughout EMEA, potentially reducing goods costs and improving sustainability by cutting down on transit delivery times.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Electronic Arts (EA) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?",
        "content": "Electronic Arts EA is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan 30.\r\n\r\nFor third-quarter fiscal 2024, EA expects GAAP revenues between $1.825 billion and $2.025 billion and diluted earnings in the range of $0.75-$1.01 per share.\r\n\r\nFor the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at $2.91 per share in the past 30 days. The figure indicates 7.38% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a 1.86% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 12.95%.\r\n\r\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\n\nElectronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nElectronic Arts Inc. price-eps-surprise | Electronic Arts Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nSteady demand for EA’s digital and live services across its portfolio is expected to have aided active user growth in the fiscal third quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, Electronic Arts announced the release of EA SPORTS NHL 24, the latest installment of the hockey game. EA also launched EA SPORTS WRC, the official game of the FIA World Rally Championship.\r\n\r\nEA SPORTS UFC 5, the latest game of the martial arts franchise, was also released in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, an increase in active users after the release of blockbuster games like EA SPORTS FIFA and Apex Legends is expected to have boosted net bookings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Apex Legends Season 18 drove greater-than-anticipated player acquisition and monetization in the fiscal second quarter. The momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nOn Oct 6, EA announced strong engagement of players in its EA SPORTS FC ecosystem, including both EA SPORTS FC 24 and EA SPORTS FC Mobile, in the first week after its launch.\r\n\r\nNet bookings for the fiscal second quarter were $1.82 billion, up 3.8% year over year or 5% in constant currency.\r\n\r\nThe company expects net bookings between $2.25 billion and $2.45 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for bookings is currently pegged at $2.383 billion, indicating a rise of 1.8% year over year.\r\n\r\nEA's strength in Live Services in mobile game franchises, such as Battlefield 2042, It Takes Two, Madden Mobile, FIFA Mobile, Tetris, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is expected to have positively impacted the top line.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, EA announced the launch of EA SPORTS FC Tactical, a new mobile game that focuses on turn-based strategy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company has been witnessing increased operating expenses for game development and marketing. The rising expenses are expected to have kept margins under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nSluggishness in video game spending in the quarter is expected to have reflected in EA’s top-line growth. Per VentureBeat, which cited NPD data on consumer spending on video games, video game spending declined 5% in October and 7% in November. For the month of December, video game sales remained mostly even, with a slight 4% increase in total sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.\r\n\r\nEA currently has an Earnings ESP of -2.65% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some stocks worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nApple is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAPL’s earnings is pegged at $2.08 per share, suggesting a jump of 10.6% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nA. O. Smith AOS has an Earnings ESP of +3.80% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nA. O. Smith is set to report its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AOS’ earnings is pegged at 95 cents per share, suggesting growth of 10.5% from the prior-year period’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nAlphabet GOOGL has an Earnings ESP of +2.26% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 30.

        "content": "By Martin Coulter, Foo Yun Chee and Supantha Mukherjee\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Apple faces strong action if changes to its App Store do not meet incoming European Union regulations, the bloc's industry chief said on Friday.\n\nIn a move designed to comply with the EU's incoming Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company will soon allow software developers to distribute their apps to Apple devices via alternative stores.\n\nFrom early March, developers will be able to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and opt out of using Apple's in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30%.\n\nHowever, critics have said the changes do not go far enough, arguing Apple's fee structure remains unfair, and that the changes may be in violation of the DMA.\n\nAsked about Apple's plans, EU industry chief Thierry Breton exclusively told Reuters: \"The DMA will open the gates of the internet to competition so that digital markets are fair and open. Change is already happening. As from 7 March we will assess companies' proposals, with the feedback of third parties.\"\n\nHe added: \"If the proposed solutions are not good enough, we will not hesitate to take strong action.\"\n\nUnder Apple's new EU regime, developers will still have to submit apps to Apple for review for cybersecurity risks and obvious fraud.\n\nApple device users in the EU will also be able to choose their default web browsers and contactless payments apps, meaning they could make contactless payments without using the Apple Pay system.\n\nBut even if developers opt not to use Apple's App Store or payment system, they will still be required to pay a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account per year.\n\nWith millions of free users, companies such as Meta and Spotify are likely to get hit more than smaller developers. Neither company was immediately available for comment.\n\nPaulo Trezentos, CEO of alternative app store Aptoide, said: \"It was a surprise to us. We heard rumours some changes were coming, but we didn't expect them to be this thorough.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This was definitely a good move, but the fees are still too high. We are preparing to send formal feedback to the European Commission.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission said: \"We take note of Apple's announcements ahead of the compliance deadline on 7 March. We do not comment on these announcements.\n\n\"We strongly encourage designated gatekeepers to test their proposals with third parties.\"\n\n(Reporting by Martin Coulter, Foo Yun Chee, and Supantha Mukherjee; editing by Jason Neely and Ros Russell)",

        "title": "55.1% of Warren Buffett's $370 Billion Stock Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett led the Berkshire Hathaway investment company to market-beating returns every year (on average) since 1965.\n\nWhen he's considering buying a stake in a company, Buffett likes to see a long track record of success, solid growth potential, and a strong management team. He especially likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, because these tools can accelerate the effects of compound growth on an investment over the long term.\n\nBuying a stock solely for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities would be out of character for Buffett (and Berkshire). But the conglomerate happens to own stakes in a number of companies that are developing aspects of the technology on top of their core businesses, and just four of them account for 55.1% of its $370 billion portfolio of publicly listed stocks. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Snowflake: 0.3% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nThough it's just a tiny piece of the portfolio, Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) was an unusual choice for Berkshire Hathaway. It purchased the stock during its initial public offering in 2020, and while Snowflake is still higher than its $120 a share IPO price, it has been below where it closed its first trading day for almost a year, it isn't turning a profit, and it doesn't pay a dividend. However, Snowflake is an innovative cloud computing enterprise with a fast-growing presence in AI.\n\nSnowflake's flagship Data Cloud product helps organizations aggregate their data onto one platform, no matter which cloud infrastructure providers they use. Its Snowpark platform is a similar innovation that helps bring software developers together to collaborate securely in one place, no matter what programming language they prefer. And the company recently launched Cortex -- a collection of AI-focused tools designed to complement those cloud services.\n\nOne such tool is Document AI, which allows businesses to extract valuable insights from unstructured data of the types commonly found in contracts or invoices. Cortex also features Snowflake Copilot, a generative AI virtual assistant capable of creating computer code from text-based prompts. That could significantly accelerate software development projects for Snowflake's cloud customers.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon: 0.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire owned Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock since 2019, well before the generative AI craze began. Buffett has often expressed regret for not buying it sooner, but Amazon is quickly becoming one of the most dominant companies in the AI industry, and the technology could drive substantial growth for it in the future.\n\nAmazon is developing AI in every segment of its business. Its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is getting the most attention from investors because it offers business customers a comprehensive portfolio of large language models to help them build AI applications. Plus, in a bid to compete with Nvidia's industry-leading hardware, Amazon has developed its own data center chips designed to process AI workloads.\n\nIt also offers generative AI tools to businesses on its e-commerce platform to help them create more engaging product images, descriptions, and ads. Plus, AI is responsible for delivering more accurate product recommendations to customers based on their search habits and purchasing patterns.\n\nAmazon could prove to be one of Berkshire's best AI bets over the long term.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 6.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nSoda and beverage giant Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) isn't a company one would normally associate with AI. But it's dabbling in the technology in a few different ways, and even appointed a global head of generative AI last year to spearhead its strategy.\n\nCoca-Cola released a drink in 2023 called Y3000 that was formulated using AI. The company collected inputs from consumers to determine their visions for the future, then had an AI use that data to predict what Coca-Cola might taste like in the year 3000. Plus, the soda giant is using AI to curate marketing campaigns. It launched \"Create Real Magic\" at Christmas time -- featuring a generative AI model powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 technology -- to allow consumers to create Christmas-themed Coca-Cola imagery.\n\nInitiatives like Y3000 and Create Real Magic are designed to engage consumers on deeper levels than traditional media-based advertising, which increases brand awareness and (theoretically) drives more sales.\n\nBerkshire owned Coca-Cola stock since 1988, and its $23.6 billion stake is the portfolio's fourth-largest holding.\n\n4. Apple: 48% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire's largest holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which also happens to be the second-most valuable company in the world (narrowly being beaten by Microsoft. Apple was founded in 1976, but most of its success has come since 2007, following the launch of its first iPhone. That led to the introduction of several billion-dollar hardware platforms, including the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones.\n\nBut Apple's latest smartphone, the iPhone 15 Pro, set the stage for its AI-powered future. It's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads more efficiently on-device, rather than relying on sending such tasks to external data centers. That means features like autocorrect and the Siri voice assistant deliver results to users much faster, but what's coming makes the new hardware even more appealing.\n\nApple is working on its own large language models, and that effort could culminate in an AI application that is intended to compete with ChatGPT. That has the potential to change the way consumers use the iPhone, because a powerful AI assistant of that caliber would bring automation to everything from emails to messages to appointment setting. The ability to quickly create and edit images and videos would also transform the way Apple users share content with their friends, families, and online.\n\nApple is positioned well in the AI race because it has an installed base of over 2 billion active devices worldwide (iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and others). That means any AI application it releases is likely to immediately see widespread adoption, potentially even leapfrogging today's leaders like ChatGPT. AI might not be the reason Berkshire first bought Apple stock, but the technology could drive substantial long-term gains for the company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Snowflake wasn't one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 26, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV, American Express Co. AXP and International Business Machines Corp. IBM.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy as Dow Hits New Milestone\n\nOn Jan 22, the Dow Index achieved a milestone, crossing the technically crucial 38,000 level for the first time in its history. The 30-stock index reached 38,109.20 before finishing at 38,001.81. Last week, the S&P 500 Index — better known as Wall Street’s benchmark — ended at its all-time highs both on intraday and closing basis.\n\nDow in 2022 and 2023 At a Glance\n\nWall Street had a highly disappointing 2022 as the inflation rate had reached a record high and the Fed had initiated an aggressive interest rate rise policy to combat elevated price levels. Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow in 2022.\n\nHowever, the Dow suffered the least. A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks.\n\nConsequently, in 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. However, the situation took a turn in 2023.\n\nSeveral economic data have pointed out that the U.S. economy has been cooling since the beginning of 2023. The inflation rate has dropped to a good extent despite remaining elevated in absolute terms. Consequently, the Fed first reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike and finally stopped the rate hike in July 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, a lower rate hike enabled growth sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary to thrive. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 43.4%. The broad-market S&P 500 Index also saw an impressive rally of 23.9%. However, the Dow was up just 13.7%.\n\nDow Set to Maintain Pace in 2024\n\nDespite initial volatility concerning the time of the first reduction in interest rate by the Fed. U.S. stock markets are in positive territory year to date. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up — 0.8%, 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively.\n\nThe Fed is set to initiate an interest rate reduction in 2024. A lower interest rate regime should be beneficial for stock markets. A low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate, thereby increasing the net present value of investment in equities.\n\nAt present, cyclical stocks are undervalued relative to growth stocks. Technically, at its current level of 37,806.39, the Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip Index of Wall Street — is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 36,566.89 and 34,672.34, respectively.\n\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.\n\nHistorically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. These companies are regular dividend payers which will act as earnings streams during the market’s downturn. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nApple Inc. is benefiting from strong demand for iPhone. AAPL expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 reported figure.\n\nAAPL expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. For the Services segment, AAPL expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\n\nApple has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.7% and 7.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last seven days. AAPL has a current dividend yield of 0.50%.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nContinued momentum in small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line of MSFT. Steady growth in Dynamics products and cloud services aided LinkedIn revenues.\n\nMicrosoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.4% and 13.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days. MSFT has a current dividend yield of 0.75%.\n\nThe Travelers Companies Inc. boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, a rise in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.\n\nTRV’s commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. TRV remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth in the auto and homeowners business. TRV expects fixed-income net investment income to be around $615 million after tax for the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Travelers Companies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 29.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days. TRV has a current dividend yield of 1.89%.\n\nAmerican Express Co. has benefited from several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances. Consumer spending on T&E, which carry higher margins for AXP, is advancing well.\n\nAXP’s balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt and ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and higher dividends.\n\nAmerican Express has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last seven days. AXP has a current dividend yield of 1.31%.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. is likely to benefit from the rising demand of its hybrid cloud and AI solutions. The buyout of Software AG’s iPaaS (integration platform-as-a-service) business is expected to accelerate watsonx data ingestion capabilities and enrich customers with additional API management features.\n\nIBM’s collaboration with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry will likely generate incremental revenues. Strong free cash flow provides IBM the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the evolving business environment.\n\nInternational Business Machines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. IBM has a current dividend yield of 3.87%.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "F5 (FFIV) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?",
        "content": "F5, Inc. FFIV is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan 29.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, F5 estimates revenues in the range of $675-$695 million ($685 million at the midpoint). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $687.1 million, suggesting a 1.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s sales of $700.4 million.\n\nThe company anticipates non-GAAP earnings in the range of $2.97-$3.09 per share ($3.03 at the midpoint). The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $3.03 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of approximately 22.7%. Earnings estimates for the quarter have remained unchanged over the past 60 days.\n\nF5’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 7.8%.\n\nLet’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings announcement.\n\nF5, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nF5, Inc. price-eps-surprise | F5, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe persistent macro uncertainty and its impact on customer spending are likely to have negatively impacted F5’s first-quarter top line, particularly the Product segment, which comprises Software and Systems sub-divisions. Our estimate of $319.4 million for the Product segment’s revenues indicates a year-over-year decline of 6.2%.\n\nThe decrease in the Product division’s first-quarter revenues is likely to be mainly due to the soft demand for its Systems products. Our estimate of $149.3 million for Systems’ revenues indicates a 13.7% year-over-year decrease.\n\nHowever, the F5 Product segment’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the improving demand for its software solutions, which had been hurt by tightened IT spending amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainties for the past few quarters.\n\nThe company’s Software revenues increased 11% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, following a decline of 2.8% and 13% registered for the third and second quarters, respectively. Our estimate for Software’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is currently pegged at $170.1 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 1.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe acceleration in BIG-IP and NGINX subscription software deals is expected to have remained a major growth driver during the to-be-reported quarter. BIG-IP’s data point performance, automation capabilities and the lower cost of ownership are likely to have helped F5 win multiple deals in the first quarter. Moreover, FFIV is anticipated to have witnessed strong demand for its NGINX subscription as large enterprises continue to adopt the solution for their cloud and Kubernetes workloads.\n\nFurthermore, high-maintenance renewals and a positive impact of the price increase introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 are expected to have boosted F5’s Services segment revenues in the first quarter. Our estimate for the Services division’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $366.1 million, suggesting an expected 1.7% increase from the year-ago quarter’s $359.8 million.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s cost-saving initiatives, which include headcount reduction, eliminating portions of its facilities footprint and travel reduction, are likely to have boosted the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for F5 this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nF5 currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, Amazon.com AMZN, Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nAmazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.58%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 1. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 54.9%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon’s fourth-quarter earnings stands at 80 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 281%. It is estimated to report revenues of $166.19 billion, which suggests an increase of approximately 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.96% at present. Apple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 3.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.09 per share, suggesting an increase of 11.2% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.88. Apple’s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve marginally to $117.52 billion from $117.15 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMeta carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.46%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 1. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 27.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.80 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 60%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $38.82 billion, calling for a year-over-year increase of 20.7%.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "FLEX Gears Up to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?",
        "content": "Flex Ltd FLEX is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan 31.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $6.73 billion, which suggests a decline of 13.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at 62 cents.\n\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11%, on average.\n\nFlex Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise Flex Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nFlex Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Flex Ltd. Quote\n\nFor third-quarter fiscal 2024, Total Flex (including Nextracker) revenues are expected to be between $6.5 billion and $6.9 billion. Management expects adjusted EPS in the range of 57-65 cents.\n\nCore Flex (excluding Nextracker) revenues are expected to be between $5.9 billion and $6.3 billion. Management expects adjusted EPS in the range of 47-52 cents.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe company’s performance in the third quarter is likely to have benefited from continued momentum in the automotive sector owing to secular demand in electrification and increasing demand for electric vehicles (EV).\n\nThe company’s industrial segment is likely to have benefited from solid demand for EV charging, automation and cloud/critical power. The healthcare segment is expected to have benefited from several program ramps and long-term secular trends.\n\nThe company expects Communications & Enterprise Compute to benefit from secular growth trends in cloud and networking technology, mainly due to strong AI-driven cloud spending.\n\nHowever, the company expects revenues in the Agility segment to be down mid-teens to low-20% due to near-term weakness in communications, enterprise IT, and consumer. The Reliability Solutions segment revenues are expected to have decreased from high-single digits to low-teens.\n\nThe lifestyle segment is likely to have suffered owing to weakness in consumer-related demand. Also, the UAW strike is a major concern for the automotive segment. Stiff competition and leveraged balance sheets are further concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for FLEX this time around.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Turn $200K Into $1 Million: January 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse, a longstanding concept, is gaining traction in the world of technology stocks. Consisting of interconnected platforms, it enables real-time communication and interaction. The key goal of the metaverse is to merge the virtual and real. For example, users can shop for products or attend concerts in the digital world.\n\nThe metaverse buzz has surged among public companies, with a surge in mentions during quarterly conference calls following Facebook’s rebranding into Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). CEO Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the future of the internet, hence this radical change\n\nNumerous firms are eager to align themselves with the metaverse narrative, reflecting the growing significance of this concept. Meta’s push into the metaverse has triggered a broader corporate interest, as companies recognize the transformative potential of this emerging space on their stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat, invests significantly in virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality (AR) software development. While this social media company may not dominate the metaverse hardware arena, it has adopted a unique approach.\n\nSnap allocates significant resources to research and development, constituting its most substantial operating expense. A substantial share of this investment focuses on advancing its VR and AR software capabilities.\n\nIn the landscape of metaverse stocks, superior VR and AR content is pivotal. Given Snap’s financial commitment to content development, its technology stands a solid chance of widespread utilization within the metaverse.\n\nAdditionally, Snap recently hit a 15-month high, a level not seen since July 2022, likely fueled by Wall Street’s bullish sentiment from the rebounding ad market.\n\nBut the social media company had already experienced an impressive year even before the analyst upgrades. Snapchat+ had over 5 million subscribers at the end of the Q3 of 2023. The number of daily active users was 406 million in Q3, an increase of 43 million, or 12%, year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Google’s parent company, primarily generates revenue through its advertising business. The majority of earnings come from Google Ads, encompassing search, display and video advertising. Moreover, Alphabet profits from cloud services and hardware products like Pixel and Nest. This diversification contributes to Alphabet’s financial strength and market influence.\n\nAlong these lines, Google has aimed for years to enter the mixed reality sector, exploring new products for user engagement and how to further diversify away from Search. Google Glass, its initial AR device, faced public disappointment, and subsequent VR products lost traction.\n\nDespite setbacks, Google envisioned facial interaction as the next frontier in computing. In 2020, a new team formed, leading to “Project Iris,” AR spectacles challenging bulkier headsets. Acquiring startups North and Raxium, Google encountered technical challenges, discontinuing Iris.\n\nThe company also has “Project Moohan,” which is a headset developed in collaboration with Samsung. Google aims for an AR glasses platform by repurposing Iris’ software, competing with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta despite internal frustrations and leadership challenges.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor company\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the three leading metaverse stocks, Qualcomm Technologies (NASDAQ:QCOM) made a significant push into the extended reality (XR) realm with its Snapdragon XR technologies. Comprising top-tier processors, software, perception technologies and developer tools, the chipmaker’s XR solutions open doors to robust possibilities for enterprise and consumers alike.\n\nBoasting high-performance, low-power computing, and the integration of 5G and AI, XR holds strong potential surpassing the combined impact of PCs and smartphones. The aim of the Snapdragon XR platforms is to replicate intricate details perceivable by the human eye.\n\nMost recently, Qualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 Platform, a cutting-edge chip designed for VR and AR. According to media reports, Google and Samsung Electronics are set to integrate this advanced chip into their immersive technology.\n\nThese advancements will allow users and communities to engage in interactive, competitive, and creative experiences through lifelike avatars, captivating virtual worlds and contextual overlays that elevate the definition of reality. On the other hand, it will position Qualcomm as one of the best-positioned metaverse stocks in the chipmaking area.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "83% of Warren Buffett's $365 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Just 7 Stocks",
        "content": "For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been putting on an investment clinic for all to see. Since taking over as the CEO of Berkshire in the mid-1960s, the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as Buffett has come to be known, has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of almost 4,500,000%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 19, 2024.\n\nLengthy books have been written highlighting the investing traits Buffett exhibits when picking out winning stocks. However, his penchant for portfolio concentration has been one of the defining factors in Berkshire Hathaway's sustained outperformance. Despite holding stakes in around 50 stocks, just seven core holdings account for 83% ($301.7 billion) of Berkshire Hathaway's $365 billion of invested assets. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple: $175,384,746,776 (48.1% of invested assets)\n\nBased on the more than $175 billion currently being put to work in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), it's crystal clear that Buffett and his team value having an outsized percentage of their company's investment portfolio in top ideas. Apple has been a continuous holding for Buffett's company for eight years.\n\nWhat makes Apple such a special company is its innovation. Its physical products have endeared users to the brand for a long time. This includes its market-leading iPhone, as well as iPad, Mac, and other wearables, such as the Apple Watch.\n\nHowever, Apple's innovation goes beyond physical products. CEO Tim Cook has been emphasizing a shift to subscription services in recent years. A services-driven operating model should further boost the company's operating margin, improve customer loyalty, and reduce the revenue swings observed during major iPhone replacement cycles.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Apple's capital-return program is unmatched among public companies. It has repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since instituting a buyback program in 2013.\n\nStory continues Effective Federal Funds Rate Chart\n\n2. Bank of America: $33,278,491,633 (9.1% of invested assets)\n\nThere's no sector of the market Warren Buffett has more knowledge of than financials. So it's not a surprise to see money-center giant Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) as Berkshire's second-largest holding.\n\nOne of the primary reasons Buffett and his team love bank stocks is because they're cyclical. Berkshire Hathaway's investment dream team is well aware that recessions are a natural part of the economic cycle. They also understand that downturns are short-lived and handily outpaced in length by periods of expansion.\n\nThese disproportionate periods of growth for the U.S. economy allow companies like Bank of America to expand their loan portfolios and steadily increase their net interest income over time. A heavy emphasis on cyclical stocks has helped Berkshire Hathaway and its shareholders.\n\nSomething else noteworthy about BofA is its interest-rate sensitivity. Changes to monetary policy will impact Bank of America's net interest income more than any other big bank. The most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades over the past two years has helped pump up its profits.\n\n3. American Express: $27,770,51,919 (7.6% of invested assets)\n\nCredit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) has been a continuous holding of Berkshire Hathaway since 1991. It's currently the third-largest holding in the $365 billion portfolio that Warren Buffett and his aides oversee.\n\nIn addition to benefiting from extended periods of economic growth, American Express is a \"double dipper\" that's generating revenue from both sides of a transaction. It's the No. 3 payment processor in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally) by credit card network purchase volume and also a lender to businesses and consumers. This allows AmEx to generate interest income and fee revenue to go along with merchant fees for processing transactions.\n\nFurthermore, American Express has a knack for attracting a more affluent clientele. Cardholders with higher incomes are less likely to alter their purchasing habits if the economy weakens. This means AmEx may be able to navigate recessions better than most lending institutions. Image source: Coca-Cola.\n\n4. Coca-Cola: $23,932,000,000 (6.6% of invested assets)\n\nBeverage stock Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the longest-tenured company in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio (since 1988) and currently its fourth-largest holding. Thanks to a minuscule cost basis of $3.2475 per share, Berkshire is netting a nearly 57% annual yield, relative to cost, on its Coca-Cola stake.\n\nWhat makes Coca-Cola great is the predictability of its operating cash flow. Food and beverages are basic-need goods that are going to be purchased in any economic climate.\n\nTo boot, the company's products can be found in all but three countries (North Korea, Cuba, and Russia -- the latter being due to its invasion of Ukraine). This virtually unparalleled geographic diversity ensures steady operating cash flow from developed markets, as well as an organic growth boost from emerging markets.\n\nCoca-Cola's marketing team has also been incredibly successful in engaging consumers for decades. The company is leaning on digital media and artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor ads to younger consumers while relying on well-known brand ambassadors to reach more mature audiences.\n\n5. Chevron: $15,681,716,627 (4.3% of invested assets)\n\nThe fifth-largest holding in Warren Buffett's portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is energy company Chevron(NYSE: CVX). Oil stocks are known for their robust capital-return programs, which makes Chevron one of Berkshire's top dividend stocks.\n\nEnergy stocks have historically not played a big role in Buffett's portfolio -- until recently. A greater than $15 billion position in Chevron indicates that the Oracle of Omaha and his team expect the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated.\n\nSupporting this take is Russia's aforementioned invasion of Ukraine, as well as multiple years of capital underinvestment by energy majors, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With oil supply constrained, a strong case can be made that the spot price for crude can head higher.\n\nAdditionally, Chevron has what might be the best balance sheet of all integrated oil and gas companies. Elevated energy commodity prices allowed Chevron to meaningfully reduce its net debt throughout 2022. It has exceptional financial flexibility, which could help when making acquisitions. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price Chart\n\n6. Occidental Petroleum: $13,750,445,662 (3.8% of invested assets)\n\nThe other big oil stock in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio is Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). The roughly 243.7 million shares of Occidental common stock held by Buffett's company have all been picked up since the beginning of 2022.\n\nOccidental is an integrated oil and gas operator like Chevron but with a meaningful twist. Whereas Chevron generates most of its revenue from its downstream operations (e.g., refineries and chemical plants), Occidental brings in the bulk of its revenue from its upstream drilling segment.\n\nIf the spot price of crude oil rises, Occidental's operating cash flow will disproportionately benefit, relative to its peers. Just understand that the opposite will happen if the spot price of crude oil declines.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Occidental Petroleum is lugging around quite a lot of debt. Although it's effectively halved its net debt since acquiring Anadarko in 2019, the $18.6 billion in net debt it was still carrying on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30 is nothing to sneeze at. Occidental very much needs the spot price of crude to remain elevated to further improve its financial flexibility.\n\n7. Kraft Heinz: $12,074,539,051 (3.3% of invested assets)\n\nThe seventh stock that, collectively with Apple, BofA, AmEx, Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Occidental, accounts for 83% of Berkshire Hathaway's $365 billion of invested assets is consumer packaged-foods and condiments company Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC).\n\nThe beauty of consumer staples stocks is the predictability of their operating cash flow. Since people need food in any economic climate, the company's cash flow doesn't change much from one year to the next.\n\nFurther, the company enjoyed a shot in the arm of organic growth during the pandemic. Kraft Heinz's well-known brands and easy-to-make meals made it a popular choice when fewer people were dining out.\n\nHowever, a case can also be made that Kraft Heinz is one of Buffett's worst investments. Kraft Heinz has reported multiple quarters of declining volume/mix, which suggests consumers are trading down to less-costly store-branded goods. With a lot of debt on its balance sheet and the company's pricing power waning, its high-yield dividend looks like its only redeeming quality for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) Could Impress as Vision Pro Launch Looms",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock may continue to be a tug of war between the bulls and the bears over the near term. Though you could build a pretty strong bullish or bearish case for the $3 trillion (or so) tech titan, I’d argue that fortune favors the bulls as the Vision Pro launch looms. Undoubtedly, the Apple Vision Pro officially goes on the market on February 2, and the reviews across the web are sure to be hot topics as many critics look to give their take on Apple’s first new product class in years.\n\nThe Vision Pro is a product that holds quite a bit of potential, but I believe its potential is being dismissed by the bears who may be missing the trees for the woods.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Vision Pro represents a giant leap in the field of spatial computing (or mixed reality, if you prefer). And though it won’t nudge earnings higher by all too much (it represents a drop in the bucket as far as 2024 is concerned), I do think those looking out to the next three to five years stand to be impressed by what the Vision Pro ultimately evolves to become.\n\nGiven this, I can’t help but remain bullish on AAPL stock ahead of the Vision Pro’s launch day.\n\nApple’s Playing the Long Game with the Vision Pro\n\nYou see, Apple plays the long-term game, and when it launches a new product, it’s looking at building profits, not just in the short term but over many years. The Apple App Store wasn’t populated with must-have apps overnight. It took years before the many must-have apps we know and love came to be.\n\nThe same thing can be said for Apple’s Vision Pro App Store. The developers need time, but they will begin to populate it with intriguing spatial computing apps that may draw in more crowds to pick up the latest iteration of Vision Pro.\n\nFor now, I’d look for the Vision Pro launch to be similar to that of the first Apple Watch, which was released just shy of a decade ago. Initially, many people scoffed at the idea of a smartwatch, given its fairly limited features.\n\nStory continues\n\nNowadays, you see Apple Watches on a broad range of different people, including those who aren’t exactly fitness buffs. From the smartwatch’s life-saving capabilities to its use as a status symbol — think the Apple Watch Ultra, which is an intriguing buy, even for those who don’t partake in “extreme” sports, deep-sea diving, or hardcore hiking — in the office, it’s clear that the Apple Watch needed a few years to warm up with consumers.\n\nThe same goes with the Vision Pro. It’s going to take time before it makes a dent in the overall product sales mix. However, it’s a mistake to overlook the technology just because a bearish analyst doesn’t view it as material over the near term.\n\nThe Vision Pro Won’t Boost Earnings Soon, but It Doesn’t Need to.\n\nOf course, the bearish analysts are right. The Vision Pro won’t magically propel earnings growth higher for the next quarter or even the quarter after that. If you’re a long-term investor focused on the next 10 years, however, I’d argue that Vision Pro is a big deal and should not be ignored at the cost of products that are more meaningful to the results in the present.\n\nFurther, Vision Pro hype alone may be able to nudge the stock higher from here if the early reviews are favorable and early demand stays hot. Thus far, pre-orders have been hot, with some pundits believing the company sold as many as 180,000 during the pre-order weekend.\n\nSo, if you look to the past, you’ll probably see that iPhone sales growth is not where it needs to be to justify the stock’s current 31.68 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. A multiple like this calls for double-digit growth, perhaps even high double-digit growth.\n\nWill Apple be able to command that through iPhone, Mac, and services alone? Possibly, assuming the economy picks up traction again in 2024. But there’s no question Apple could use a new product to do more of the heavy lifting over the coming years.\n\nAs the Vision Pro gets smarter and richer with experiences (wait for that Vision Pro App Store to populate, folks), lighter, more comfortable, and more affordable, you can bet that more Apple users are going to want to make the big purchase.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 32 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target is $203.52, implying upside potential of 4.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.\n\nThe Takeaway: Don’t Discount the Vision Pro’s Potential\n\nWhether the average person starts dawning spatial computers in public two years from now or more than five years from now, I believe AAPL stock could have a lot to gain into the back half of this year as we finally get our hands on a Vision Pro. It’s a product that could give us a glimpse of the future — one that could be profoundly prosperous for Apple.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "According to the International Monetary Fund, we are on the brink of a technology revolution spearheaded by artificial intelligence. The technology will boost productivity, accelerate global growth and raise incomes globally. Multiple AI stocks will benefit from this transformation.\n\nToday, businesses are analyzing how they can leverage AI to improve productivity and how it affects the competitive landscape. Already, organizations are using AI in various use cases, such as application development, customer service, pharmaceutical discovery and creative design.\n\nHowever, to achieve the promise of AI, companies must make significant investments. That starts with the data and models they use. First, organizations are investing in systems to collect, store, manage and access massive data sets. Then, using the right models, they can derive patterns from their data to drive decision-making, customer service and innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAcross the artificial intelligence stack, several companies are meeting various needs. From chip companies producing chips for training large language models to companies developing large language models. These AI stocks are at the forefront of this race and will be winners in 2024.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the largest semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the leading AI stocks. The company is seeing soaring demand as the scramble for AI chips for data centers and edge computing grows. Over the years, many integrated device manufacturers transitioned to fabless designers, cementing Taiwan Semiconductor’s importance in chip production.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has built an unassailable competitive advantage in its process technology. By investing heavily in research and development, it has maintained leadership in node advancement. As a result, it attracts and retains high-quality, fabless customers. For instance, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in mobile chips and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphic processing units.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, the company is producing leading-edge node chips for its AI customers. Competitors have had challenges producing these chips, enabling Taiwan Semi to dominate the market and charge higher prices. Already the firm is producing 3-nanometer chips for Nvidia, Apple and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as competitors struggle to catch up.\n\nOn January 19, the company released results and issued upbeat guidance. The company is benefitting from cloud service providers upgrading their data centers with chips supporting AI capabilities. Management was optimistic on high-performance computing demand related to AI, forecasting more than 20% revenue growth in 2024.\n\nWhile AI adoption has been mainly in the data center, it will become ubiquitous, supporting Taiwan Semi’s growth. Consumer devices such as smartphones and industrial equipment will need AI capabilities, ushering in the next growth cycle.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it is primarily a social media company, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a player in the AI for a while. Its increased efforts in the field came out of necessity after Apple’s IDFA changes curtailed user tracking. Faced with diminished advertising accuracy, Meta Platforms pivoted to AI.\n\nTwo years later, the company has become one of the top AI stocks. Notably, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has touted AI as “the foundation of our discovery engine and our ads business.” The company has amassed hundreds of top A.I. researchers and invested in significant computer power to power these systems. These efforts are paying off with impressive results.\n\nIn February 2023, it released LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) a foundational large language model. Meta’s aim was to advance AI research. Then, in July 2023 it released LLaMA 2 for research and commercial use. Impressively, the model outperforms other open-source language models in coding, reasoning, proficiency, and knowledge tests.\n\nMeta has adopted a unique approach, giving away its models for free. By open-sourcing its models, Meta hopes third-party developers will help improve the platform. Like Linux became the open-source operating system, Meta hopes Llama will become integral to building the next generation of AI applications.\n\nZuckerberg recently committed to developing artificial general intelligence. He pledged to spend heavily on compute infrastructure to support this effort. If Meta Platforms manages to standardize AI development through its open-source models, it will be a key player in the ecosystem. Considering Zuckerberg’s focus on winning in AI, it remains one of the top artificial intelligence stocks, and certainly one of the artificial intelligence stocks you should grab.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), has been derided for losing the AI war to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These assessments seem overly pessimistic. The company is an innovator and will prove the doubters wrong.\n\nThe search giant has made significant investments in artificial intelligence. The most significant one was the 2014 acquisition of DeepMind. Secondly, Google has been using artificial intelligence in search for a while, even before OpenAI launched ChatGPT.\n\nMoreover, it is introducing products that will integrate generative AI into search. Today, users can rely on Bard for chat-like responses. It is also testing Search Generative Experience and has expanded its features since its May 2023 launch.\n\nOne competitive advantage that positions Google to succeed is its high-quality training data. Today, Google has six products with over 2 billion users and 15 products, each with more than 500 million users. This data has been crucial in creating context-aware AI functions. For instance, features such as Smart Compose in Gmail have significantly improved the user experience.\n\nAlphabet’s leadership among artificial intelligence stocks extends beyond software to hardware, making it one of the best AI stocks. It developed a specialized chip, a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), specifically for AI applications. Its TPUs and open-source framework, Tensor, power services such as Gmail, Maps and YouTube.\n\nAs Google integrates AI into its products, it will see more growth. For example, serving context-rich ads into generative search results will improve ad conversion and monetization. In December 2023, Google released Gemini, its latest and most powerful LLM, proving Alphabet is still in the AI race. Don’t count out this technology giant yet; it has the resources to win!\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you were asked how many firms currently are valued at $1 trillion or more based on market cap, what would you guess? The answer might surprise you. It’s six. Of those six, one, Saudi Aramco, Is not readily accessible to American investors as it isn’t listed on commonly accessed exchanges.  Anyway, long story short, reaching a valuation of $1 trillion is an extraordinary feat. This has led us to this article on what brands could be the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nInvesting in such companies inherently makes sense. These companies are extraordinarily powerful and due to their extreme success are likely to continue to thrive. The three companies listed below could be the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is currently the 7th most valuable publicly traded stock overall. It boasts a market cap of $966 billion at the time of writing. Thus, Meta Platforms is very close to being considered one of those trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf and when Meta Platforms reaches $1 trillion it won’t be the first time it has achieved the feat. In late 2021 the company – then named Facebook – surpassed the mark. Shares are currently retesting those former highs in part due to positive remarks from Mizuho Securities. Analysts there recently increased their 12-month target price from $400 to $477.  If shares rise to that level, that would be almost exactly $100 above price levels when the shares first eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.\n\nArithmetically, that would suggest that Meta Platforms’ market capitalization would increase by more than 26% leading to a new evaluation above $1.2 trillion. It’s an entirely reasonable expectation given how strongly the company has rebounded in 2023 and into early 2024.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn reality, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is quite far from realistically reaching $1 trillion in valuation. However, AMD has made such significant strides over the last few years that it warrants discussion.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, AMD’s market cap is as high as it’s ever been, just above $260 billion. The company essentially has to quadruple in value to reach $1 trillion. Current projections suggest it could happen by the year 2031 based on share prices alone and the assumption that float does not increase.\n\nCertainly, other stocks much closer to $1 trillion in market cap at the moment are likely to cross that threshold first. However, I want to note just how rapidly AMD has grown over the last decade. In 2015 it was valued at less than $2 billion. The company has grown by a factor of 130 in less than a decade.\n\nToday, AMD is carving out a position as a legitimate challenger to Nvidia about artificial intelligence. The company will release its mi300 chips this year. Those chips are already seeing substantial demand from dominant firms that scoop up large volumes of chips for generative AI purposes.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a very interesting year for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)  and its stock. The company is known to be the largest foundry in the semiconductor industry. It is responsible for the technology behind the leading chips which it manufactures for the world’s best-known chip companies including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and more.\n\nTaiwan semiconductor manufacturing’s market cap has only eclipsed $700 billion once in its history. it is currently valued at less than $600 billion. However, the company’s recent bullish projections for 2024 chip production are a strong signal overall. The company expects the revenue growth to be above 20% this year.\n\nThat growth rate is roughly double that expected across the wider semiconductor sector overall. The bullish take here is that 2024 is shaping up to be a period of continued growth overall. Additionally, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Rafael Bostic Stated that he expects rate cuts to be implemented earlier than he had previously anticipated. Should that occur, it’s reasonable to believe that the tech sector will receive a boost which could drive Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing even higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Whispers: 3 Stocks With Recent Analyst Upgrades",
        "content": "Analyst upgrades aren’t gospel.\n\nBut retail investors should pay close attention to the way top analysts and “smart money” operators position themselves in today’s economic climate. Though we’re still (technically) in a bull market, increased nervousness around higher interest rates and Magnificent Seven concentrations point to wider bearish tendencies throughout the analyst class.\n\nTherefore, investors should take note when analysts upgrade stocks today. Sure, upgrades are easy in an era of “stocks go up.” Yet, they’re harder to justify when compressed margins and reduced profitability pressure growth sectors. Likewise, analysts offering upgrades do so with greater due diligence than they may have in the past. And this reinforces their bull thesis with an emphasis on fundamentals rather than high-flying dreams.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts upgraded these three companies this week, so investors should pay attention to their reasoning.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is low-hanging fruit when it comes to analyst upgrades. The company’s recent earnings report showed stellar growth and smart moves by management to position the media company amid shifting consumer trends. The number of bullish analysts polled by research firm EquitySet jumped to 20 from 6 after the report, with just one calling the stock a sell.\n\nThe report was strong across the board. Netflix posted a 12% revenue growth, 3% operating margin improvement, and $6.9 billion in free cash flow. Of course, the big news impacting Netflix this week is the announcement of the TKO Group Holdings (NYSE:TKO) partnership that will bring live-streamed wrestling to the platform. While Netflix affirmed its position as an entertainment provider rather than a sports platform, which fits within the deal’s spirit. Yet further indications point to a larger sports-based pivot on the horizon.\n\nLast summer, Morgan Stanley analysts echoed the apparent pivot, saying, “Eventually we expect Netflix to move into live sports, particularly as it scales in [free cash flow] generation and has the ability to invest in major sports rights around the world. In addition, as its advertising capabilities scale, we think live sports will fit well into its content offering.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHertz (HTZ) Hertz (HTZ) sign in Montevrain, France on May 8, 2016.\n\nSource: aureliefrance / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a few very difficult years, Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ) might be positioned for a reversal if Morgan Stanley analyst upgrades are any indication.\n\nIn the note, analyst Adam Jonas pinned Hertz’s per-share price at $15, nearly double its current trading price. Jonas pointed to Hertz’s decision to sell off a chunk of its electric vehicle (EV) fleet. It is seen as a wise financial decision, benefitting the company in the long term.\n\nHertz decided to limit its EV fleet largely on the heels of higher maintenance and repair costs combined with reduced customer interest in EVs when picking a rental car. And, while Hertz will likely have to write down much of its remaining fleet as values fall, the sale will likely infuse Hertz with much-needed cash as the company considers its next direction.\n\nAlso, Jonas pointed to increased travel trends that imply a strong vehicle rental market later in 2024, undoubtedly putting wind into Hertz’s sails.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nContrarian moves usually take a bearish approach to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But, on the heels of recent downgrades, Bank of America’s bullish report stands out from the more conservative crowd. In the note, analyst Wamsi Mohan pushed his price target to $225 from $208, representing a 16% upside from today’s per-share pricing.\n\nMohan specifically pointed to Apple’s pivot towards services rather than hardware alone. Podcast hosting tends to have high margins for limited back-end work.\n\nAt the same time, Apple is rapidly working to improve its verticals by designing and manufacturing more components in-house rather than relying on outsourced labor and effort. Pivoting away from reliance on third-party chipmakers helps improve Apple’s profitability, of course. Yet, it also shields it from geopolitical and supply chain risks that started during the pandemic and continues today as shipping lanes see increased stress.\n\nApple is a long-time analyst favorite, but shifting winds put consensus price targets at $199 per share, closer to where it trades today. From that perspective, investors should closely consider Mohan’s assessment as it goes against wider analyst estimates.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 blue chip dividend stocks to buy now. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe origin of the term \"blue chip\" traces back to poker, where the blue chip represents the highest value. In the realm of investing, blue chip stocks are renowned for their high value and are regarded as superior long-term investment options. These stocks have a historical track record of delivering consistent growth in long-term portfolios. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is often considered a blue-chip stocks index. The DJIA is a widely followed stock market index that represents 30 of the largest and most established publicly traded companies in the US. These companies are leaders in their respective industries and are generally considered to be stable, well-established, and financially sound. The index concluded 2023 at an almost unprecedented high, registering an impressive gain of 13%.\n\nWhen evaluating the performances of the S&P 500 and DJIA, both of which aim to monitor large-cap U.S. companies, historical analysis indicates that while the returns of these two indices have shown a high correlation over time, there have been instances of significant divergence in their performance. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the S&P 500 demonstrated a substantial outperformance compared to the DJIA over the one- and three-year periods. However, over the more extended 30-year horizon leading up to 2019, the DJIA slightly outperformed its counterpart. This suggests that while these indices often move in tandem, short-term variations in performance can occur, and the relative strength of each index can be influenced by specific market conditions and economic factors during distinct timeframes.\n\nThe report further examined the annual turnover rates for both the S&P 500 and DJIA spanning from 1997 to 2020. Throughout this timeframe, the average turnover rates were relatively comparable, with the S&P 500 registering an average turnover of 4.56%, and the DJIA slightly higher at 5.82%. Turnover rates in this context refer to the percentage of holdings within the indices that are replaced or traded annually. The similarity in average turnover suggests a comparable degree of activity and change in the composition of the two indices over the years. Investors and analysts often use turnover rates to assess the level of trading activity within an index, and the closeness in these figures for the S&P 500 and DJIA implies that, on average, both indices experienced a relatively consistent degree of rebalancing and turnover during the specified period.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the key characteristics that set blue chip stocks apart is their ability to generate reliable and steady income for investors. Many blue chip companies have a long-standing tradition of distributing a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best blue chip dividend stocks among others that are mentioned below in our list. 15 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by Artem Beliaikin on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we began by examining both current and past members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that boasted a minimum market capitalization of $100 billion as of January 25.

        "title": "35 Most Gay-Friendly Cities in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 35 most gay-friendly cities in the world. If you want to skip our discussion about the LGBTQ+ community in the US, its contribution to the economy, and legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals and their implications for corporate America, go to 10 Most Gay-Friendly Cities in the World.\n\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) defines sexual orientation as \"an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction toward men, women, or both sexes\". It has been a topic of hot debate for centuries. It is only very recently that homosexuality has started to get much-needed acceptance in society. However, even as we are well within the third decade of the twenty-first century, there are places where homosexuality is not accepted. The APA recognizes the stigma of mental illness associated with lesbian, gay, and bisexual orientations. It also recognizes that sexual orientation tends to define the group in which a person is more likely to find satisfying and romantic romantic relationships.\n\nThe LGBTQ+ community in the United States is quite prominent. According to a survey by Pew Research Center, 7% of adults in the country identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation also quotes similar figures, as according to them, the LGBTQ+ population in the United States is at least 20 million or 8% of adults. This figure is also corroborated by the Gallup survey, which claims that LGBT identification in the US was 7.1% as of 2022. According to Gallup, LGBTQ+ identification in 2020 was 5.6%, so we have seen a significant increase between 2020 and 2022. Gallup survey also reports the higher prevalence of LGBTQ+ identities in the youngest US adults. Around 21% of Generation Z Americans, who have reached adulthood, identify as LGBTQ+. For perspective, this figure is roughly double of LGBTQ+ identification in millennials. The LGBTQ+ community also contributes significantly to the US economy. Their contribution, most notably, comes through entrepreneurship and business ownership. According to the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), businesses owned by LGBTQ+ individuals have contributed $1.77 trillion to the economy and have created 33,000 jobs. These businesses generate more than $2 million in annual revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite their significant contribution to the economy, LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to face financial hardships compared to other Americans. High rates of food and economic insecurity were noted among the LGBTQ+ communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, they are also more likely to face discrimination in public settings such as education and employment, which further worsens their economic hardships. Recognizing these difficulties and a bias against them, all states have legislated legal protection in favor of LGBTQ+ individuals. As of June 5, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that employment discrimination against people belonging to the LGBTQ+ community is prohibited. Rights such as anti-discrimination, fair housing, and credit and lending vary by state.\n\nHowever, all states have some sort of protection for them. It should be noted that the legal landscape of LGBTQ+ individuals is constantly evolving. These protections have implications for the business in the United States. They are required to provide equal employment opportunities to LGBTQ+ individuals, and they can be held liable for any discrimination. Some of the top American companies go above and beyond for this cause. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the largest companies in the world. In fact, here is what Polen Capital, an investment management company, said about the company in its fourth quarter 2023 Investor letter:\n\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. While on a total attribution basis, Apple was not a top three detractor to our full-year return, given its extremely large weighting in the Index, we feel it’s worth sharing our thoughts.\n\nThe company’s share price appreciated nearly 50% in a year when its revenue declined and earnings per share was relatively flat with the previous year.\n\nFor 2024, consensus expectations are for low-single-digit revenue growth and only slightly faster EPS growth. These pedestrian growth rates are not surprising for a company with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue. What is more surprising is that Apple shares trade at nearly 30x forward earnings, a large premium to the market and many faster-growing, competitively advantaged businesses.\"\n\nThe company also leads from the front when it comes to creating a culture of inclusivity. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) has policies that explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. In addition, it donates to causes that promote equality and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) also provides comprehensive benefits to people in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nCoca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) is one of the largest beverage companies in the world. It has a long-standing support for the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, it has received 100% on HRC’s Corporate Equality Index every year since 2006. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) also has an LGBTQ employee resource group in all the major countries it operates. The company also offers transgender-inclusive health insurance coverage to its employees. In addition, Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) is also known to put its money behind legislation to fight against anti-LGBTQ+ Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) legislation.\n\nMore recently, we are starting to see online applications aimed at improving the lives of people belonging to the LGBTQ+ community. One such product is Kalda, which is the world's first LGBTQ+ mental wellbeing application. It provides a stigma-free community where members can access daily peer mindfulness. The app aims to support mental health within the community. Another application is Zoteria, which was launched to handle LGBTQ+ hate crimes. The app lets its users flag LGBTQ+ hate incidents and keep the community safe.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 35 most gay-friendly cities in the world.  35 Most Gay-Friendly Cities in the World\n\nRnDmS/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of the most gay-friendly cities in the world, we relied on four (1,2,3,4) sources and gave them equal weightage.

        "content": "(Adds comments from Epic Games chief executive in paragraphs 4-5)\n\nBy Stephen Nellis\n\nJan 25 (Reuters) - Apple on Thursday outlined its plans to allow software developers to distribute their apps to users in the European Union outside of Apple's own App Store.\n\nThe move is in response to a new EU law called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires companies with more than 45 million monthly active users and a 75 billion-euro ($82 billion) market capitalization to, among other things, make their apps compatible with those of rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices.\n\nStarting in March, developers will be able to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and opt out of using Apple's in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30%. However, developers will still have to submit apps to Apple for review for cybersecurity risks and obvious fraud, and Apple will charge a \"core technology fee\" to major app developers even if they do not use any of Apple's payment services.\n\nTim Sweeney, chief executive of \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games, which pursued an antitrust case against Apple in the United States, criticized Apple's planned changes as \"hot garbage\" and said he does not believe the moves are legal under the DMA.\n\n\"Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store,\" Sweeney said in a series of posts on social media platform X. \"They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing 'Fortnite\" through it, for example, or block Microsoft, Valve, Good Old Games, or new entrants.\"\n\nApple released tools on Thursday for developers to begin making changes to their business arrangements, and consumers will see the changes with an update to the iOS operating system in March.\n\nFirms such as Epic and Spotify Technology have for years said that Apple's commissions and restrictions impeded their businesses. But in recent years, Apple's once-monolithic App Store approach has become a patchwork of rules as the tech company responds to legal and regulatory challenge.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, earlier this month, Apple said it would alter rules around linking out of apps to third-party websites for payment in the United States to comply with a ruling in an antitrust suit brought by Epic. But Apple also said it will charge a 27% commission on proceeds of those link-outs, which, when combined with a typical 3% payment processing fee, means developers will receive few economic benefits.\n\nIn the EU, by contrast, developers will be able to use a third-party payment processor inside an App Store app free of charge. Apple will also let EU iPhone users select a default web browser and contactless payments app, which means EU users can make contactless payments without using the Apple Pay system.\n\nBut even if developers opt not use Apple's App Store or payment system, they will still be required to pay a \"core technology fee\" of 50 euro cents per user account per year.\n\nApple said that only large developers will pay the fee, though it did not specify how many users will trigger the fee. The company said the first 1 million user accounts will be exempt and that it will not charge the fee to nonprofits, schools or governments.

        "title": "Apple Overhauls App Store, iPhone Features in EU to Appease Regulators",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is embarking on a historic overhaul of its iOS, Safari and App Store offerings in the European Union, aiming to placate regulators set to impose tough new antitrust rules.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Sinks After Warning About ‘Notably Lower’ Growth Rate US GDP Grew 3.3% Last Quarter, Capping Unexpectedly Strong Year Microsoft Cuts 1,900 Jobs in Gaming, Including at Activision Boeing Blocked From Building More 737s in Hit to Growth Plan\n\nThe revamp will allow customers to download software from outside the App Store for the first time, the company said Thursday. They’ll also be able to use alternative payment systems and more easily choose a new default web browser — addressing two frequent complaints of developers and lawmakers.\n\nThe sweeping changes — coming in March as part of Apple’s iOS 17.4 operating system — is a direct response to the EU’s new Digital Markets Act, which imposes rigid restrictions on the largest tech firms and boosts the EU commission’s powers as the region’s antitrust enforcer. Still, Apple is mounting a legal challenge against the regulations through the EU courts.\n\nThe announcement is a big moment for both Apple and the EU. The closed design of the App Store was a founding principle of the technology — aimed at ensuring security, safeguarding the user experience and boosting revenue. For the EU, Apple’s changes are the biggest test yet of whether it can force meaningful reforms in how the world’s largest tech companies operate.\n\nThe announcement jarred investors, who sent the shares negative after earlier gains. As of 2:08 p.m. in New York, the stock was down less than 1% at $193.83.\n\nApple executives cautioned on Thursday that the changes do threaten to undercut the company’s long-held emphasis on user security.\n\n“Apple is having to create technology to allow an app to install other apps, and inherent in that is risk,” Phil Schiller, a longtime Apple marketing chief who now runs the App Store, said in an interview Thursday. “That could be a big threat vector for the privacy, security and integrity of your device. So Apple is putting in place technologies and policies to try and minimize that risk.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSchiller added that in a big year for elections worldwide — with the associated threats of malware and malicious technologies circulating — there may be “new risks for users” from downloading apps from alternative app marketplaces that don’t share Apple’s security standards. The company will not extend its content-related guidelines to a third-party marketplace.\n\nAs part of the overhaul, developers will be able to create tap-to-pay apps using the iPhone’s payment chip, as well as browsers with third-party engines and extensive game streaming services. They’ll also be able to request deeper access to iPhone hardware and software features.\n\nThe new approach jettisons the up-to-30% commission that Apple has imposed on developers since its App Store launched in 2008. They’ll now pay the company a cut of 17% on app sales, and that declines to 10% for most developers and subscriptions after their first year. The company isn’t changing its commission structure outside of the EU.\n\nStill, there are new costs for software makers. The company has introduced two additional fees: a 3% payment processing charge for apps that use Apple’s in-app purchase system, and a €0.50 fee per app install — via Apple’s store or third-party marketplaces — for software installed more than 1 million times in a 12-month period.\n\nMore than 99% of developers in the EU will see their payments to Apple decrease or stay the same, and fewer than 1% will need to pay the app install fee, the company said. The move also means that apps sold outside the App Store won’t require any commission beyond the €0.50 fee.\n\nThe shift could hurt Apple’s services revenue, a key area of growth for the tech giant in recent years. That category now accounts for more than 20% of the company’s sales, up from less than 10% a decade ago.\n\nApple’s in-app purchase system won’t apply to software downloaded outside the App Store — a process known as sideloading. When developers distribute their software in that way, the only fee to Apple is the €0.50. But the apps will still need to be notarized and checked by Apple for security threats, the company said.\n\nAdditional adjustments include new developer tools for third parties to create their own app download stores and web browsers without using WebKit — the standard Apple has required since the beginning of the App Store.\n\nThird-party app stores will only be able to be installed from a developer’s website. Several software makers have already said they intend to launch their own stores to take advantage of the changes.\n\nFor the first time, banks and other financial services will be able to compete with Apple Pay on the iPhone and create tap-to-pay apps. Apple customers can set up a third-party payment app or app store as their default choice in their settings as well. In another concession, users will be prompted to choose a default web browser the first time they open Apple’s Safari on iOS 17.4.\n\nBloomberg News reported on Apple’s plans in December 2022.\n\nApple is also responding to longtime complaints by allowing developers like Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. to create an application that can stream an unlimited number of games within the single app. That change will be available globally.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act, or DMA, also makes it illegal for certain platforms to favor their own services over those of rivals. Companies are barred from combining personal data across their different services or using information they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them.\n\nIn a related matter, Apple faces a potentially huge fine from EU antitrust regulators over how its App Store rules allegedly thwart music-streaming rivals from offering alternative, cheaper subscription options. That investigation was sparked by European music streaming giant Spotify Technology SA. The fine could be as much as 10% of Apple’s annual sales — although EU penalties seldom reach that level.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, there has also been an antitrust focus on App Store abuses. In mid-January, the US Supreme Court declined to hear appeals by Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. related to an antitrust suit over the App Store, bringing the case to a conclusion.\n\nThe trial judge in that case found Apple’s App Store rules didn’t violate federal antitrust law. However, she ruled that the company’s limits on developer communications flouted California’s state antitrust law.\n\nTim Sweeney, the chief executive officer of Epic Games, responded to Apple’s new policies, saying the plan was a case of “malicious compliance.”\n\n“They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under DMA, or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don’t process,” Sweeney wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nIn anticipation of the Apple announcement, Spotify said earlier this week that it would distribute companion apps to its main service via the web and enable in-app purchases inside its iPhone software.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief, said Thursday that the main question with Apple’s changes will be whether they are an attempt to follow the new rules or go around them.\n\n“That’s what will be our test of it,” she said during a briefing with journalists. “Is this a way to circumvent the intention of the legislation?”\n\n--With assistance from Sanne Wass.\n\n(Updates with responses from Epic Games and Spotify starting in the fifth-to-last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround Goldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Can America’s New Union Hero Take on Elon Musk’s Tesla?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Apple has unveiled a sweeping plan to tear down some of the competitive barriers that it has built around its lucrative iPhone franchise.\n\nThe announcement Thursday comes as it moves to comply with upcoming European regulations aimed at giving consumers the choice to use alternative app stores.\n\nThe overhaul, scheduled to take effect in early March, will include concessions that Apple had previously refused to make in its app store, including lowering the fees that it collects from developers in Europe.\n\nMost notably, Apple for the first time will allow iPhone users in Europe to switch to use app stores other than the company-operated one that comes installed on the mobile device. It will also enable enable developers to offer alternative payment systems that could help them make more money while potentially lowering their prices.\n\nBut Apple says it believes opening up the iPhone to outsiders will also increase the chances that consumers venturing outside its proprietary system will be exposed to hackers and other security problems. It says it is taking what it sees as a risky step only to comply with European rules that take effect March 7.\n\nThe revisions will also include decreasing the 15% to 30% commission that Apple plans to continue charging throughout the rest of the world on in-app transactions completed on the iPhone.\n\nIn Europe only, Apple is dropping its commission on in-app transaction to 10% to 17% for developers who opt to stay within the company's payment processing system. Apple won't collect any commissions on in-app transactions completed through alternative payment systems.\n\nThat is a stark contrast to how Apple is complying with a court ruling that took effect last week that requires it to allow iPhone apps to provide links to different payment options in the U.S. If an in-app transaction is completed outside the Apple system in the U.S., the company plans to collect commissions from 12% to 27% to prevent freeloading on its iPhone software. Apple will continue to charge 15% to 30% on in app-transaction done through its payment system in the U.S.",

        "content": "(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nFor developers, the changes include new options for app distribution and payment processing\n\nFor users, the changes include new controls and disclosures, and expanded protections to reduce privacy and security risks the DMA creates\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif., January 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced changes to iOS, Safari®, and the App Store® impacting developers’ apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but don’t eliminate — new risks the DMA poses to EU users. With these steps, Apple will continue to deliver the best, most secure experience possible for EU users.\n\nThe new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. That’s why Apple is introducing protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments — to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain.\n\nDevelopers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.\n\n\"The changes we’re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act’s requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world,\" said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow. \"Developers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission’s designation of iOS, Safari, and the App Store as \"core platform services\" under the Digital Markets Act. In March, Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA’s changes bring — including a less intuitive user experience — and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the App Store.\n\nAvailable for developers’ apps around the world, Apple also announced new options for streaming games, along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement, commerce, app usage, and more.\n\nChanges to iOS\n\nIn the EU, Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA. For developers, those changes include new options for distributing apps. The coming changes to iOS in the EU include:\n\nNew options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces — including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces. New framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces — enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app. New frameworks and APIs for alternative browser engines — enabling developers to use browser engines, other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences. Interoperability request form — where developers can submit additional requests for interoperability with iPhone® and iOS hardware and software features.\n\nAs announced by the European Commission, Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area. And in the EU, Apple is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app — or an alternative app marketplace — as their default.\n\nInevitably, the new options for developers’ EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices. Apple can’t eliminate those risks, but within the DMA’s constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March, and include:\n\nNotarization for iOS apps — a baseline review that applies to all apps, regardless of their distribution channel, focused on platform integrity and protecting users. Notarization involves a combination of automated checks and human review. App installation sheets — that use information from the Notarization process to provide at-a-glance descriptions of apps and their functionality before download, including the developer, screenshots, and other essential information. Authorization for marketplace developers — to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and developers. Additional malware protections — that prevent iOS apps from launching if they’re found to contain malware after being installed to a user’s device.\n\nThese protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, and authorization for marketplace developers — help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer.\n\nHowever, Apple has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines — other than Apple’s WebKit — may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life.\n\nWithin the DMA’s constraints, Apple is committed to protecting the privacy, security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible. For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store — asking a user’s permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA’s requirements mean that App Store features — including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy — will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.\n\nWhen these changes come into effect in March, Apple will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users — including best practices for protecting their privacy and security.\n\nChanges to Safari\n\nToday, iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser — other than Safari — as their default. Reflecting the DMA’s requirements, Apple is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options.\n\nThis change is a result of the DMA’s requirements, and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen also interrupts EU users’ experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage.\n\nChanges to the App Store\n\nOn the App Store, Apple is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU, affecting apps across Apple’s operating systems — including iOS, iPadOS®, macOS®, watchOS®, and tvOS®. The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store’s secure payment processing.\n\nFor developers, those changes include:\n\nNew options for using payment service providers (PSPs) — within a developer’s app to process payments for digital goods and services. New options for processing payments via link-out — where users can complete a transaction for digital goods and services on the developer’s external website. Developers can also inform EU users of promotions, discounts, and other deals available outside of their apps. Business planning tools — for developers to estimate fees and understand metrics associated with Apple’s new business terms for apps in the EU.\n\nThe changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users, including:\n\nApp Store product page labels — that inform users when an app they’re downloading uses alternative payment processing. In-app disclosure sheets — that let users know when they are no longer transacting with Apple, and when a developer is directing them to transact using an alternative payment processor. NewApp Review processes — to verify that developers accurately communicate information about transactions that use alternative payment processors. Expanded data portability on Apple’s Data & Privacy site— where EU users can retrieve new data about their usage of the App Store and export it to an authorized third party.\n\nFor apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Helpful App Store features — like Report a Problem, Family Sharing, and Ask to Buy — will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information. And on the App Store, users’ purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store’s In-App Purchase system.\n\nNew Business Terms for Apps in the EU\n\nAlso today, Apple is sharing new business terms available for developers’ apps in the European Union. Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms, or stay on Apple’s existing terms. Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing.\n\nDevelopers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store’s secure payment processing and share their apps on the App Store in the EU. And both sets of business terms reflect Apple’s long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers.\n\nThe new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA’s requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ businesses — including distribution and discovery on the App Store, the App Store’s secure payment processing, Apple’s trusted and secure mobile platform, and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.\n\nDevelopers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the App Store and/or alternative app marketplaces. These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the App Store, across Apple’s operating systems.\n\nThe new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements:\n\nReduced commission — iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent (for the vast majority of developers and subscriptions following their first year) or 17 percent on transactions for digital goods and services. Payment processing fee — iOS apps on the App Store can use the App Store’s payment processing for an additional 3 percent fee. Developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple. Core Technology Fee — iOS apps distributed from the App Store and/or an alternative app marketplace will pay €0.50 for each first annual install per year over a 1 million threshold.\n\nUnder the new business terms for EU apps, Apple estimates that: More than 99 percent of developers would reduce or maintain the fees they owe to Apple. Less than 1 percent of developers would pay a Core Technology Fee on their EU apps.\n\nFor apps on iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS in the EU, developers who process payments using a PSP or by linking out to their website will get a 3 percent discount on the commission they owe to Apple.\n\nApple is also sharing a fee calculator tool and new reports to help developers estimate the potential impact of the new business terms on their app businesses. Developers can learn more about the changes for EU apps on a new Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing these capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple’s five software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit Apple Newsroom (www.apple.com/newsroom), or email Apple’s Media Helpline at media.help@apple.com.\n\n© 2024 Apple Inc.

        "content": "According to a report from The Verge, Microsoft (MSFT) is laying off 1,900 employees from its Activision Blizzard and Xbox divisions, which represents about 8% of its total gaming workers.\n\nAn International Data Corporation (IDC) report revealed Apple (AAPL) iPhone shipments to China fell 2.1% in the fourth quarter, which add to concerns waning demand for iPhones in the region.\n\nShares of Nokia (NOK) are spiking on Thursday morning as investors remain optimistic about Nokia's plans to turn the business around, despite the company reporting a decline in sales and drop in profit for the fourth quarter.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right. Let's take a look at some of those individual movers here. Microsoft cutting 1,900 workers in its video gaming divisions. That includes Activision, Blizzard, according to a report by the Verge. Now, the cuts represent about 8% of Microsoft's 22,000 gaming workers. And this comes just three months after the tech giant finalized its buyout of Activision.\n\nBRAD SMITH: And another big tech company in the news, Apple. IDC reporting iPhone shipments fell 2.1% in China last quarter adding to demand concerns right now. The shares flat just barely to the upside right now.\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right. Nokia shares jumping this morning, despite reporting a double-digit decline in sales. Also, a drop in profit in the fourth quarter. Investors, though, they seem optimistic about their planned turnaround-- their expected recovery, I should say, and also, future cost controls.

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.2%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $117.52 billion, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.57% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?\n\nFor Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.96%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of +5.04%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nApple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer said in a latest program on CNBC that \"all is not well in corporate America.\" Cramer was referring to weak earnings which according to him show that the state of the economy is \"sluggish.\" Cramer said that we are \"hearing\" that the Fed might not be done tightening or at least be \"reluctant to cut in the spring\" because inflation remains sticky. Jim Cramer said that when the Fed began hiking interest rates stocks were punished and when the Fed pivoted near the end of 2023 stocks exploded which included many companies which, according to Cramer, didn’t \"deserve\" to see their stock prices soar.\n\nJim Cramer said that latest earnings show the effects of the Fed's tightening. He said many companies that raised prices are now seeing sales declines, which means they will have to roll back price hikes which would affect their stock prices. Cramer said it's \"disturbing\" but it's part of the business cycle.\n\n\"Throw Out the Old Playbook\"\n\nIn a separate program, Jim Cramer said the Fed's tightening cycle is peculiar in nature in its effects on stocks. Cramer said homebuilder stocks like Pulte Group, Lennar and Toll Brothers are going higher despite rate hikes while in the past homebuilder stocks always got punished during rate hikes. Cramer said in any \"normal\" tightening cycle stocks from homebuilding, steel and industrials sectors would get slaughtered but in this cycle many of the stocks from these sectors touched new highs.\n\nCramer also said the \"AI craze should have ended ages ago\" but stocks like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are still going higher. Cramer said that means AI was not a hype, after all.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer also said people kept complaining about lack of market breadth and the concentration of market gains in a few companies often called the Magnificent Seven group. Cramer said this lack of breadth has not mattered \"one bit.\"\n\nCramer said when the market is not sticking to the old playbook anymore, you've \"got to throw out\" the playbook and write a new one. Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds?Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer recently recommended investors to \"hold\" BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock. Cramer said he does not understand why this stock is so \"inexpensive.\" Over the past one year BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock has lost about 31%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX). The most significant stakeholder of BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) during this period was Israel Englander's Millennium Management which owns a $54 million stake in BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX).\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Notable trims in the quarter included Zscaler, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Ingersoll Rand. BioNTech is a biotech company focused on developing immunotherapies to treat cancer and other serious diseases. Management has been using its COVID-19 vaccine cash flows to reinvest in building a substantial early stage pipeline. The company’s intellectual property in mRNA and COVID-funded manufacturing capacity leave it well positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While we are optimistic that this pipeline will eventually yield promising medications within oncology and infectious diseases, patience will be required. In the meantime, demand for COVID-19 vaccine boosters continues to wane. Therefore, we decided to trim the position in favor of more compelling near-term opportunities.”\n\n9. Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nA caller recently asked Jim Cramer during his program about his thoughts on buying some more Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) stock. Cramer said you \"should\" buy more shares of the industrial tools company. Cramer highlighted the stock's over 3% dividend yield. Cramer said that if people are buying Home Depot on lows, they should be buying Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK).\n\n8. Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS), Jim Cramer said it is the \"best one of the silver companies.\"\n\n\"Holy cow, they crushed it,\" said Jim Cramer about the Canada-headquartered mining company.\n\nFor 2024, Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS) expects its total silver production to be between 21 million to 23 million ounces, while total gold production is expected to be between 880K - 1,000K ounces.\n\nA total of 22 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS). The most notable stakeholder of Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS) during this period was David Greenspan's Slate Path Capital which owns a $76 million stake in Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS).\n\n7. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 36\n\nJim Cramer recently recommended investors to buy gold stocks. Here's what Jim Cramer said when he was asked whether Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) stock should be bought:\n\n\"When rates go up, people sell gold, and that means you should buy gold. Because we buy gold for insurance.”\n\nIn December, Barron's published a list of its favorite stock picks for 2024. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) made it to the list. Barron's likes Barrick Gold Corp's (NYSE:GOLD) plans to increase mine output by 30% by the end of the decade. Barron's thinks Barrick Gold Corp's (NYSE:GOLD) CEO Mark Bristow is the industry's \"most effective leader.\"\n\nLike GOLD, Jim Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company in its Q3 earnings call talked about guidance and future plans:\n\n\"We are expecting a further improvement in production in the fourth quarter. But as I pointed to the annual production is now expected to be marginally below the low end of the 4.2 million to 4.6 million ounce range. Copper remains on track to achieve its guidance of 420 million to 470 million pounds. As you can see here, the financial results were strong with operating cash flows growing by 35% to more than $1 billion quarter-on-quarter, free cash flow up significantly to $359 million and a 26% increase in adjusted net earnings to $0.24 per share. Barrick’s robust balance sheet secures our capacity to continue investing in our growth projects independent of the market, both new and existing, while we continue to reward our shareholders through dividends.\n\nWhile growing our business, we have also been driving a new safety culture, including a new set of standards and initiatives to keep improving this important part of our business. We call this the Journey to Zero. Sadly, this key priority was impacted by two fatalities during the quarter, which are deeply disappointing for me and the company. We remain highly motivated to achieve these Zero goals.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nIn a latest program on CNBC, while answering a question about Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA), Jim Cramer said that Moderna Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stéphane Bancel is the \"real deal.\" Cramer said that he would \"back\" Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) at the current levels.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA).\n\nEarlier this month, Goldman Sachs published a list of stocks with weak pricing power it believes can outperform. Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) made it to the list. In addition to Moderna, Jim Cramer is also bullish on  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nModerna during its Q3 earnings call talked about its guidance and future expectations:\n\nFor the U.S., we expect 2024 to be at least $2 billion and believe it will grow over time. Lastly, we expect approximately $1 billion from RSV and other international COVID sales. And finally, in 2025, we expect a return to growth. Let me finish by giving you a more fulsome view on 2024 and our thinking on 2025. Starting with 2024, as I just explained, we expect sales to be approximately $4 billion. Cost of sales are expected to be approximately 35% of sales. R&D expenses of approximately $4.5 billion in 2024, would be down 6%. In 2024, the majority of our R&D expenses are for registration trials, which are now mostly committed. I will speak to our view on 2025 R&D expenses in a moment. SG&A expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in 2024 would be down 13%.\n\nWe expect taxes to be negligible in 2024 and capital expenditures to be similar to 2023 at $0.9 billion. In summary for 2024, Spikevax will generate nearly $1 billion of income. When we combine that with our estimated investments in R&D and capital expenditures, our cash balance is projected to be approximately $9 billion at the end of 2024. Now for our preliminary thoughts on 2025. As mentioned earlier, sales will return to growth.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires 13 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now George Soros and Jim Cramer Love These Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Apple and Cenovus Energy have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 25, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Apple AAPL as the Bull of the Day and Cenovus Energy Inc. CVE as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AT&T Inc. T, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ and T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nApple stock ended 2023 and started 2024 on a downbeat note as some analysts raced to outsmart themselves with various downgrades of the iPhone maker based on concerns about slowing growth in China and other headwinds.\n\nYet, Apple is up around 8% since January 5 and approaching its mid-December records heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on February 1. Apple’s recent wave of upward earnings revisions help AAPL earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nApple is certainly no hidden gem, but who cares? The moral of our story today is that it pays to keep it simple and buy shares of one of the true Wall Street titans as part of a healthy, well-rounded portfolio.\n\nApple is far more than an iPhone maker these days. Plus, AAPL is trading above all of its key short-term and long-term moving averages.\n\nRecent Negativity\n\nA few notable analysts downgraded Apple stock over the last month or so. Their concerns focused on slowing iPhone sales, with a particular focus on China, among wider fears about an increasingly saturated high-end smartphone market. There are also constant worries about legal battles regarding its App Store and more.\n\nApple is facing mounting competition from rival Huawei Technologies in the world’s second largest economy. AAPL is also suffering setbacks in the Chinese market, as are many other companies across various industries, due to the broad-based economic slowdown in China. Geopolitical fears play their part as well.\n\nAAPL’s overall sales declined YoY during the trailing four quarters, with total FY23 revenue down 2.8% (its third YoY decline in the last eight years).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the mounting concerns about Apple’s business in China and its economy more broadly, AAPL’s revenue in China only slipped by roughly 2.2% in fiscal 2023 (vs. Apple’s wider 2.8% drop). Apple’s total iPhone revenue fell by over 2% last year, and smartphone sales climbed by 2.8% in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe iPhone and Beyond\n\nApple’s branding power remains nearly unmatched and its constant cycles of new phones and devices keeps people wanting more. Many consumers upgrade to new iPhones and other devices habitually, even if there isn’t a game-changing difference, and would never think of leaving the Apple universe.\n\nApple sold $200 billion worth of iPhones in FY23 up from $142 billion in FY19. Apple’s long-term growth case is not difficult to make in a world full of smartphone addicts, especially as its subscriptions grow within its key services unit.\n\nChief executive Tim Cook has focused on transforming Apple beyond an iPhone maker by continually making money from its loyal and growing customer base. Apple’s services segment climbed by 9% in FY23 to account for 22% of sales, making it by far the biggest segment outside of iPhone.\n\nApple said last quarter that it had an installed base of “over 2 billion active devices,” which “continues to grow at a nice pace.” AAPL’s services efforts go beyond its App Store and include Netflix and Spotify competitors, a subscription news offering, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, digital workout classes, and more.\n\nAAPL finished its most recent period with “over 1 billion paid subscriptions across” its services, marking nearly double the number it had three years ago. On top of that, Apple has brought more of its chips in-house and it is quietly spending heavily on rolling out AI features in its smartphones and other devices.\n\nNear-Term Outlook\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) reported upbeat results on January 18 and provided strong guidance that signals a return to growth for the smartphone market. Apple’s revenue is projected to climb by 3% in FY24 and jump 6% higher in FY25 to reach $418.36 billion vs. $383.29 billion in FY23.\n\nMeanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to grow by 8% in FY24 and another 9% higher next year to come in at $7.19 per share. This would come on top of marginal EPS growth last year.\n\nApple has topped earnings every period over the last five years outside of a small miss in the first quarter in FY23.\n\nBetter yet, Apple’s earnings revisions have trended higher over the last month for FY24 and FY25, with its most accurate/most recent estimates solidly above the already-improved consensus. The bottom line positivity helps it capture a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.\n\nPerformance, Technical Levels & Valuation\n\nAAPL stock is up around 8% since January 5 and it trades 6% below its average Zacks price target and around 2% under its mid-December records. The rebound took Apple back above its 50-day and 21-day moving averages and from oversold RSI levels to above neutral.\n\nApple shares have climbed by roughly 1,000% in the last 10 years to top Microsoft (MSFT) and blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 275% run. Apple is only up 36% in the past three years vs. Microsoft’s 75%.\n\nAAPL has also underperformed Tech during the last 12 months, which means it might be less overheated than some might assume.\n\nApple is currently trading above its very long-term 21-month moving average and it appears far from overheated by historical RSI standards.\n\nValuation-wise, Apple trades at a roughly 20% discount to its five-year highs at 28.8X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its median or Tech.\n\nBottom Line\n\nApple returned $25 billion to shareholders last quarter via buybacks and dividends. The firm is also still investing heavily in future growth endeavors such as artificial intelligence, EVs, and beyond.\n\nSome investors might decide they would rather attempt to find the next Apple. But sometimes betting on the favorite works better than going with the underdog.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nCenovus Energy Inc. is an integrated oil and energy firm that experienced a wave of downward earnings revisions recently. Cenovus Energy is also part of a low-ranked Zacks industry, and energy is the only one of 11 S&P 500 sectors still in the red over the trailing three months.\n\nCVE Basics\n\nCenovus Energy is a Canadian-based integrated energy company headquartered in Calgary. The firm runs oil and natural gas production operations in Canada and the Asia Pacific region. Meanwhile, its upgrading, refining, and marketing operations are based in Canada and the U.S.\n\nCenovus Energy has been on a wild ride alongside oil and energy prices since the initial Covid-19 selloff. CVE is coming off an impressive stretch of top and bottom-line growth along with nearly all of its peers. But CVE, like the entire industry, faces off against a hard to compete against stretch and a slowing global economy.\n\nZacks estimates call for Cenovus Energy’s adjusted earnings to fall roughly 33% in FY23 on 28% lower sales.\n\nThe company is currently projected to bounce back on both the top and bottom lines in 2024. However, CVE’s earnings revisions have started to trend in the wrong direction again recently.\n\nCenovus Energy’s FY23 earnings estimate is down around 6% in the last 60 days, with its FY24 estimates 5% lower. The company’s fourth quarter earnings figure is currently 33% lower than it was several months ago. Worse yet, CVE’s most recent/most accurate estimates came in far below the already beaten-down consensus.\n\nBottom Line\n\nCenovus Energy lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at the moment because of its negative revisions trend. Therefore, investors might want to stay away from the stock for now, or at least until after it reports on February 15.\n\nCVE shares are down -40% in the last 10 years vs. the Zacks Oil and Energy sector’s -20% downturn and the S&P 500’s +180% climb. Cenovus Energy stock is also trading below its 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages.\n\nAll that said, some investors might want to circle CVE on their watchlists since fossil fuels are poised to play a huge role in the global economy for a long time.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nCosts of Fiber Deployment & Industry Implications\n\nThe Fiber Broadband Association recently unveiled the findings of its 2023 Fiber Deployment Cost Study, conducted by Cartesian. This study serves as a pivotal benchmark for fiber broadband service providers, offering insights into cost profiles and areas of inefficiency. The implications of this study extend beyond statistical figures, providing a roadmap for industry participants navigating the complex terrain of fiber deployment.\n\nLabor: A Dominant Cost Factor\n\nThe study underscores the significant role of labor in deployment costs, contributing to 73% of underground build costs and 67% of aerial costs. Understanding these proportions is crucial for broadband providers seeking to optimize their cost structures, especially when leveraging public and private funding to connect communities.\n\nRegional Variations and Deployment Methods\n\nThe study not only highlights labor costs but also unveils regional variations and cost differentials between deployment methods. These nuances are essential for industry players to tailor their strategies based on geographical considerations and the most efficient deployment methods.\n\nKey Findings and Common Themes\n\nThe survey, spanning diverse industry participants, revealed common themes that will be explored in an upcoming webinar. Labor emerges as a consistent factor, accounting for more than two-thirds of build costs. The initial cost disparity between aerial and underground deployment is notable, but the study suggests that higher operational expenditures of aerial deployment balance this out in the long run.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nIn 2024, respondents anticipate an overall increase in deployment costs. However, several categories are expected to show improvement. While 76% of respondents noted material cost increases in 2023, only 58% anticipate the same for 2024. Additionally, a majority expects engineering and permit costs to decrease in the coming year, signaling potential efficiency gains.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nAs the industry grapples with the dynamics of fiber deployment, the insights from the 2023 Fiber Deployment Cost Study provide a valuable compass. Industry participants like AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. are likely to use this information to refine their cost management strategies, optimize deployment methods and make informed decisions in a landscape where reliable broadband connectivity is a paramount goal. The findings particularly gain significance as the industry players are increasingly focusing on fiber densification for a more connected future.\n\nFiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. Telecom service providers are increasingly leaning toward fiber optic cable to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud-based business data and video streaming services by individuals.\n\nMoreover, the fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last-mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers to deploy the 5G network. The companies are expanding their fiber optic networks to support 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards as well as wireline connections.\n\nDisclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

        "content": "Warren Buffett primarily invests in equities directly through his company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which is one of the most watched institutional investor portfolios in the world. As of Sept. 30, Berkshire Hathaway has over $313 billion in assets under management invested in 45 stocks.\n\nWhile Buffett’s prowess in direct stock investments is widely acknowledged, a lesser-known aspect of his financial empire is Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary New England Asset Management Inc. (NEAM). Acquired in 1998, New England Asset Management operates discreetly but is a crucial driving force behind Berkshire Hathaway's growth.\n\nTotal Assets Under Management\n\nOn June 19, 1998, Berkshire Hathaway announced its plans to purchase worldwide reinsurance firm General Re for $22 billion. Although General Re’s reinsurance division stood out as the primary motivator for Buffett’s decision to pursue the acquisition, the company also boasted a distinctive investment services sector recognized as New England Asset Management.\n\nThe completion of the all-stock transaction took place in December 1998, marking the integration of General Re, along with all its subsidiaries, including NEAM, into the Berkshire Hathaway family.\n\nNew England Asset Management has approximately $68.4 billion in assets under management, as of Sept. 30. However, according to NEAM's latest Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the company's total investments are valued at nearly $610 million.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nNEAM's Biggest Holdings\n\nMicrosoft Corp.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the best-performing tech companies in 2023, with its growth strategies lauded by analysts nationwide. The tech behemoth established itself as the third-largest gaming company in the world in terms of revenue by acquiring Activision Blizzard last year. Microsoft's strategic investment in OpenAI in 2019 paid off after the latter's generative AI platform ChatGPT became one of the fastest-growing consumer applications in history.\n\nMicrosoft's explosive growth last year propelled it to become the largest company in the world in terms of market capitalization, dethroning Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Shares of Microsoft have popped by nearly 65% over the past year.\n\nNonetheless, analysts forecast further upside for the tech giant, as Truist Securities has a Buy rating on Microsoft with a price target of $600, indicating a potential upside of over 50%. Exane BNP Paribas also has an Outperform rating on the stock, with a price target of $471, which indicates a potential upside of over 17%.\n\nNew England Asset Management has a sizable stake in Microsoft, as it makes up approximately 2.1% of its total portfolio.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nNew England Asset Management's total holding of Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock accounts for over 1.7% of its total portfolio. The company, which is hailed as the largest manufacturer of computer networking equipment in the world, acquired cybersecurity software company Splunk Inc. in September to strengthen its foothold in the cybersecurity space.\n\nShares of Cisco have underperformed compared to the benchmark Nasdaq Composite Index, as it surged by only 8% over the past year. However, Cisco has significant growth potential as Chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins expects it to \"become one of the largest software companies globally.\"\n\n\"Our combined capabilities will drive the next generation of AI-enabled security and observability,\" Robbins said in a statement. \"From threat detection and response to threat prediction and prevention, we will help make organizations of all sizes more secure and resilient.\"\n\nAnalysts expect Cisco's earnings per share EPS to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% per annum over the next five years.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "content": "On Jan 22, the Dow Index achieved a milestone, crossing the technically crucial 38,000 level for the first time in its history. The 30-stock index closed reached 38,109.20 before finishing at 38,001.81. Last week, the S&P 500 Index — better known as Wall Street’s benchmark — ended at its all-time highs both on intraday and closing basis.\n\nDow in 2022 and 2023 At a Glance\n\nWall Street had a highly disappointing 2022 as the inflation rate had reached a record high and the Fed had initiated an aggressive interest rate rise policy to combat elevated price levels. Major stock indexes suffered a huge blow in 2022.\n\nHowever, the Dow suffered the least. A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like consumer discretionary and technology. In contrast to the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indexes, the 30-stock Dow is more inclined to cyclical stocks than growth stocks.\n\nConsequently, in 2022, the Dow fell 8.8% year over year, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively. However, the situation took a turn in 2023.\n\nSeveral economic data have pointed out that the U.S. economy has been cooling since the beginning of 2023. The inflation rate has dropped to a good extent despite remaining elevated in absolute terms. Consequently, the Fed first reduced the magnitude of interest rate hike and finally stopped the rate hike in July 2023.\n\nLast year, a lower rate hike enabled growth sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary to thrive. Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 43.4%. The broad-market S&P 500 Index also saw an impressive rally of 23.9%. However, the Dow was up just 13.7%.\n\nDow Set to Maintain Pace in 2024\n\nDespite initial volatility concerning the time of the first reduction in interest rate by the Fed. U.S. stock markets are in positive territory year to date. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up — 0.8%, 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Fed is set to initiate an interest rate reduction in 2024. A lower interest rate regime should be beneficial for stock markets. A low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate, thereby increasing the net present value of investment in equities.\n\nAt present, cyclical stocks are undervalued relative to growth stocks. Technically, at its current level of 37,806.39, the Dow — popularly known as the blue-chip Index of Wall Street — is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 36,566.89 and 34,672.34, respectively.\n\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.\n\nHistorically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. These companies are regular dividend payers which will act as earnings streams during the market’s downturn. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple Inc. AAPL is benefiting from strong demand for iPhone. AAPL expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 reported figure.\n\nAAPL expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. For the Services segment, AAPL expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\n\nApple has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.7% and 7.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last seven days. AAPL has a current dividend yield of 0.50%.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nContinued momentum in small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line of MSFT. Steady growth in Dynamics products and cloud services aided LinkedIn revenues.\n\nMicrosoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.4% and 13.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days. MSFT has a current dividend yield of 0.75%.\n\nThe Travelers Companies Inc. TRV boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, a rise in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.\n\nTRV’s commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. TRV remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth in the auto and homeowners business. TRV expects fixed-income net investment income to be around $615 million after tax for the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Travelers Companies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.6% and 29.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days. TRV has a current dividend yield of 1.89%.\n\nAmerican Express Co. AXP has benefited from several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances. Consumer spending on T&E, which carry higher margins for AXP, is advancing well.\n\nAXP’s balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt and ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and higher dividends.\n\nAmerican Express has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last seven days. AXP has a current dividend yield of 1.31%.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. IBM is likely to benefit from the rising demand of its hybrid cloud and AI solutions. The buyout of Software AG’s iPaaS (integration platform-as-a-service) business is expected to accelerate watsonx data ingestion capabilities and enrich customers with additional API management features.\n\nIBM’s collaboration with SAP to tap generative AI technology within the retail industry will likely generate incremental revenues. Strong free cash flow provides IBM the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the evolving business environment.\n\nInternational Business Machines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.

        "title": "Warren Buffett's \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence Bets: 48.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's $365 Billion Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks",
        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett used to have a reputation for avoiding technology sector investments because of the complexities involved. On the other hand, it's probably fair to say the Oracle of Omaha changed his tune. Today, over half of Berkshire's stock portfolio is made up of technology-focused businesses. Even more striking, 48.5% of its $365 billion portfolio is actually held in just two \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nNamed for their incredible sizes, resources, and technology advantages, the Magnificent Seven is a group that includes Microsoft, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Each of these technology giants is a major player in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. But notably, only two of them have attracted investment from Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $2.96 trillion, Apple stands as the second-most-valuable publicly traded company, trailing just slightly behind Microsoft. While the iPhone maker recently lost its title as the world's largest business, it remains the largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio by far.\n\nBerkshire's last public filing showed that it owned more than 915 million shares of Apple stock. At today's prices, that position is worth over $175 billion and accounts for approximately 48% of the total stock portfolio Buffett's company owns.\n\nApple has been somewhat secretive about its AI initiatives, but it has some big advantages in the space. For starters, the tech giant has a massive base of users who love its mobile devices, computers, wearables, software, and services. The company's loyal user base love its ecosystem, and its customers also generates tons of valuable data that can be fed to AI systems.\n\nApple leads the market when it comes to smartphone unit sales in the U.S. and the world at large, a particularly impressive feat given that it typically sells hardware at higher prices than its competitors. Thanks to its incredible pricing power and the popularity of its products, the company captures roughly 85% of worldwide operating profits on smartphone sales. Apple continues to dominate the mobile market, and it's also been an early mover in the voice-based-assistant space with its Siri software.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf AI-powered personal assistants come to be a revolutionary new product category in the way some analysts and tech luminaries are predicting, Apple's user base and early mover advantages could help it be a big winner in the space. Strength in the unfolding virtual-assistant space could give way to big opportunities in online search, e-commerce, and productivity software.\n\nIn addition to virtual-assistant technologies and other AI features that will continue to evolve on its mobile and computer hardware, Apple is reportedly working on a self-driving smart car. The tech leader's incredible brand strength could make it a formidable player in the auto market. Delivering an AI-powered computing platform on wheels could have disruptive impacts across multiple industries.\n\nAs the AI revolution continues to unfold, Apple's existing strengths and penchant for delivering hugely influential products could help the stock continue to be one of Buffett's biggest winners.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns 10 million shares of Amazon stock, a position that's valued at roughly $1.5 billion. While that holding works out to just 0.4% of Berkshire's total stock portfolio, it's the only other Magnificent Seven stock the investment conglomerate owns -- and it has a range of exciting AI opportunities.\n\nWhile Amazon is best known as a market-leading e-commerce company, the large majority of its profits actually come from its cloud-infrastructure services. Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to lead the cloud computing market, and it will see rising demand as more applications are developed, launched, and scaled on its infrastructure.\n\nGenerative AI tools and features have already been rolled out on AWS and seem to be a hit with customers, and the business stands to see long-term tailwinds stemming from the development of new artificial intelligence services on its infrastructure.\n\nBut the cloud unit isn't the only Amazon business poised to benefit from AI. The tech giant has built a fast-growing digital advertising business on the foundation of its massively popular e-commerce business. The company has huge troves of data on what users of its online retail platform are interested in, and AI should continue paving the way for increasingly efficient digital ad targeting.\n\nBeyond boosting its ad business, AI also has the potential to revolutionize key facets of the company's online retail business. AI is likely to power huge increases in robotics capabilities and help Amazon unlock the untapped profit potential of its massive e-commerce business.\n\nWhile the company's online retail operations have historically generated a relatively low margin because of high costs, increased warehouse automation stands to be a major positive catalyst. The rise of AI-powered autonomous vehicles and delivery robots is also likely to increase profitability for the e-commerce business.\n\nBetween its cloud business, digital ads unit, and online retail segment, Amazon is poised to win big with AI on multiple fronts. While the tech giant occupies a relatively small position in the Berkshire portfolio, it wouldn't be surprising to see Buffett's company increase its holdings in the stock at some point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "10 Best Small Cap Chemical Stocks to Buy",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best small cap chemical stocks to buy. If you want to skip our overview of small cap stocks and the chemical industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Small Cap Chemical Stocks to Buy.\n\nInvesting in small cap stocks is different from investing in others. These companies, whose market capitalization sits below $2 billion, are present by the thousands on the stock market. Even though they do not receive significant media coverage, small caps form the backbone of the economy, and when it comes to American small cap stocks, the performance of these firms is more closely tied to the U.S. economy. While firms such as those belonging to the semiconductor industry can rely on a global market courtesy of robust logistics networks, small cap firms such as Banc of California, Inc. (NYSE:BANC) often do not have the funds to establish a global presence.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that if a firm is a small cap stock then it can not have a global presence. For instance, small caps such as Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:SBLK) operate all over the world and if their operations are disrupted, then the consequences can be far reaching.\n\nThe ability of small cap stocks to play a central role in global economies and industries provides them an added advantage. This comes in the form of lower share prices that can significantly appreciate in the future if a small cap firm's management executes a growth strategy to increase the value of its balance sheet. The potential for share price gains stands in contrast to established companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose stock is preferred primarily due to the stability that billions of dollars in assets and an established global presence provide a company with.\n\nOne sector of the stock market that is closely tied to the performance of the global economy is the chemicals sector. Chemicals are used for industrial and consumer applications, and they are essential for the smooth functioning of vast and unrelated industries such as hospitality and semiconductor fabrication. In fact, chemicals created quite a bit of controversy in one of the most popular industries in the world today, i.e., semiconductor fabrication.\n\nStory continues\n\nChip fabrication companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Intel Corporation (NYSE:INTC) require copious amounts of chemicals to ensure product purity. Chip fabrication is an intensive process, and even the slightest impurities can affect quality and performance. Subsequently, wherever chip firms set up shops, such as TSMC and its new facilities in Arizona, they require a well developed supply chain to ensure smooth raw material procurement.\n\nOne chemical needed for making chips is per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS. PFAS are used in making jet engines, cars, and chips. For chips, the chemicals are present in the chip manufacturing machines as well as during the lithography process to print billions of nanometer sized circuits on a chip. However, these chemicals have also been shown to potentially have links to thyroid cancer, and while their properties such as durability and corrosion resistance make them suitable for industrial uses, these same properties also mean that PFAS are called 'forever chemicals.'\n\nThese have led to global calls to stop their use, and in 2023, when one of the world's biggest industrial firms 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) announced that it would stop PFAS production by 2025, the chip companies weren't happy. In fact, according to a report in the Financial Times, 3M's decision led to Intel and TSMC springing to action. According to FT's source in an American Intel and TSMC supplier, the two firms \"summoned\" suppliers to make sure they'd have enough supplies for production as 3M left the industry.\n\nAs to the current environment in the chemicals industry, here's what the management of The Chemours Company (NYSE:CC) had to say during the firm's Q3 2023 earnings call:\n\nYou know, 2023 has been a challenging year with a weaker second-half than we expected. But The Chemours team remains focused on driving long-term shareholder value and improvements in our three industry-leading businesses. Most of our year-over-year performance deterioration has been driven really by lower TT volumes, and we have responded with reductions of the TT Transformation Plan, which will shine through in 2024, as we see demand weakness decelerating. Our APM business is also seeing some demand weakness, especially in advanced materials, but we have achieved, again, double-digit growth year-to-date of 11% in our performance solutions. And this business remains tied in to long-term secular gains in advanced electronics and clean energy, which we’re hugely excited about.\n\nAnd then finally, our TSS business continued with strong performance with another record net sales. This is the seventh quarterly net sales record in a row. And as we look again to 2024, we have the step down in the AMAC that's going to drive further Opteon adoption and beyond ‘24 [Technical Difficulty] of immersion cooling in 2025. So again, we're excited about the work that's on the way here at the company. And despite the challenging environment we see ourself in, remain focused on what we have to do going forward into 2024.\n\nSo, if you're interested in small cap and chemical stocks, then find out more below.

        "content": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.)\n\n*\n\nFutures: Dow up 0.25%, S&P up 0.06%, Nasdaq flat\n\nJan 25 (Reuters) - Futures tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were subdued on Thursday, as investors paused after a technology-fueled Wall Street rally to size up a slew of key economic data, while Tesla slumped on a warning of slowing growth.\n\nTesla lost 7.8% in premarket trading after cautioning that sales growth may slow down sharply this year, while expecting to start production of next-generation electric vehicle at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025.\n\nOther EV makers Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group fell over 2% each.\n\n\"Any significant attempt (of Tesla) to boost sales and revenues from here on will probably come at the cost of further falls in operating margin, on having to compete with BYD in China, one of its biggest markets, as well as increased competition elsewhere,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nThis comes in the face of concerns over whether earnings would support the rich valuations for heavily weighted megacap companies, also known as the \"Magnificent 7\", that have been the key driver of a Wall Street rally since late 2023.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 climbed to its fourth straight record high close on Wednesday, after hitting an intraday all-time high for the third time in less than a week, with Netflix surging nearly 11% on blowout quarterly results.\n\nIntel's result is due after the market closes, with its shares up 1.2% in early trade.\n\nMegacaps Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Nvidia were up between 0.2% and 1.1%, while Microsoft slipped 0.1% after its market value surpassed $3 trillion for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nApple slipped 0.5% after supplier STMicroelectronics, an European chipmaker, forecast an over 15% drop in first-quarter revenue, and data showing the iPhone-maker's smartphone shipments in China shrank 2.1% year-on-year in the final quarter of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the day, investors will keenly monitor data on fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) and personal consumption expenditures advance, December durable goods and weekly jobless claims.\n\nAll eyes will be on the trend for inflation, any signs of weakness in the U.S. labor market and chances of a soft landing before the Federal Reserve's policy decision next week.\n\nBets of interest-rate cuts commencing as early as March have now shifted to May, seen at 87%, as per CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nAt 5:36 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 94 points, or 0.25%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.75 points, or 0.06%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 3.25 points, or 0.02%.\n\nAiding Dow futures, IBM jumped 8% after forecasting full-year revenue growth above estimates.\n\nAmong others, Ford Motor shed 1.1% as the automaker expects to record a pre-tax remeasurement loss of about $1.7 billion.\n\nBoeing dropped 2.3% after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration barred the troubled planemaker from expanding production of its 737 MAX narrowbody planes.

        "title": "How To Tech: Why it's important to turn on Apple's new Stolen Device Protection",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — You’re in a crowded bar when a thief watches you unlock your iPhone with your passcode, then swipes it. That sinking feeling hits when you realize it's gone, along with priceless photos, important files, passwords on banking apps and other vital parts of your digital life.\n\nApple rolled out an update to its iOS operating system this week with a feature called Stolen Device Protection that makes it a lot harder for phone thieves to access key functions and settings. Users are being urged to turn it on immediately.\n\nHere's how to activate the new security option and why it's so important:\n\nSHOULD I TURN ON STOLEN DEVICE PROTECTION?\n\nThe software update for iPhones and iPads includes the essential new feature designed to foil thieves from wiping phones for resale or accessing Apple ID or other important accounts. Stolen Device Protection is a new setting that's included with the latest iOS release, version 17.3.\n\nApple says the feature, buried in your iPhone's settings, adds an extra layer of security for users. It addresses a vulnerability that thieves have discovered and exploited: allowing them to lock victims out of their Apple accounts, delete their photos and other files from their iCloud accounts and empty their bank accounts by accessing passwords kept in the Keychain password manager.\n\nApple is introducing the feature as anecdotal evidence suggests phone thefts are surging. Stories of stolen phones abound on Reddit groups and in news articles in places from Los Angeles to London, where police say pickpocketing, “table surfing\" and moped snatching are common tactics.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last year how criminals watched people use their passcodes to gain access to their personal information after stealing their phones.\n\nHOW DOES STOLEN DEVICE PROTECTION WORK?\n\nStolen Device Protection keeps track of a user's “familiar locations,\" such as their home or workplace, and adds extra biometric security hoops to jump through if someone tries to use the device to do certain things when it's away from those places.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt also reduces the importance of passcodes, which thieves can steal by peering over someone's shoulder or threatening and forcing victims to hand them over, in favor of “biometric” features such as faces or fingerprints that are a lot harder to duplicate.\n\nLet's say the bar thief that snatched your iPhone tries to erase its contents and settings to sell it. With Stolen Device Protection turned on, the phone will now require a Face ID or Touch ID scan to verify that person is the rightful owner.\n\nAnd that's the only way — the new feature doesn't let someone use the passcode or any other backup method.\n\nOther actions that will trigger this feature if it's not at a familiar place include using passwords saved in Keychain or payment methods saved in Safari, turning off Lost Mode, applying for a new Apple Card or using the iPhone to set up a new device.\n\nThere’s also a second layer designed to slow down thieves trying to access critical security settings. If someone tries to, say, sign out of an Apple ID account, change the passcode or reset the phone while it’s in an unfamiliar location, they’ll have to authenticate using Face ID or Touch ID, wait an hour, then do a second facial or fingerprint scan.\n\nChanging an Apple ID password, updating Apple ID security settings, adding or removing Face or Touch ID, and turning off the Find My device feature or Stolen Device Protection also will trigger this feature.\n\n“The security delay is designed to prevent a thief from performing critical operations so that you can mark your device as lost and make sure your Apple account is secure,” the company said. \"When your iPhone is in a familiar location, these additional steps will not be required and you can use your device passcode like normal.\"\n\nHOW DO I ACTIVATE STOLEN DEVICE PROTECTION?\n\nIt's simple — if you know where to look.\n\nFirst, download and update your iPhone or iPad with the latest iOS update. Then go to your settings, scroll down to “Face ID & Passcode” or “Touch ID & Passcode” and enter your passcode. Scroll down and you’ll see Stolen Device Protection.\n\nDepending on your iPhone model, you'll need to tap or toggle to turn it on or off. Make sure you've first activated two-factor authentication and Find My device for your Apple ID account, or it won't show up.\n\nWHAT DEVICES DOES IT APPLY TO?\n\nIPhone XS and newer models, including second- and third-generation SE models.",

        "title": "11 Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.\n\nGrowth stocks have rewarded investors over the past several years, thanks to the hyper growth and mind-numbing expansion of technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Data from the CFA Institute showed that since the end of the financial crisis, growth stocks outperformed value stocks by 144% through June 2018. The study highlighted that this massive outperformance was not a \"fluke\" since most of the growth stocks studied were trading at decent valuation multiples during 2009 and they also saw earnings growth during the period which was analyzed in the study.\n\nIn theory, growth stocks tend to underperform during a high interest rate environment when investors turn to realistic valuations and move away from risky assets. But what happened last year was the opposite of this. That means Mr. Market really cares about AI and the impact it is creating. That's why investors are still happy to buy technology stocks trading at higher multiples. Many analysts believe we are going through the beginning of the AI revolution and the AI products and services mega-cap technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making will have far-reaching consequences on human progress.\n\nCan Growth Stocks Continue to Outperform in 2024?\n\nFinancial markets defied all expectations last year and avoided the much-feared recession. But will the AI-related euphoria and economic resilience help the stock market this year? UBS said in its 2024 market outlook report that it would be \"historically unusual\" if the US economy ends up avoiding recession after the rate hikes of 2022 and 2023. But the report said there is a reason for optimism this time as UBS expects no significant economic contraction in 2024 even though it sees a slowdown in growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Invest in Quality Stocks with Higher Multiples?\n\nIn this environment, UBS recommended investors to pile into quality stocks. The firm said quality stocks can have higher valuations on a relative basis but it said quality stocks would be worth paying for this year.\n\n\"Quality stocks have historically outperformed in the late stages of the business cycle, including in periods of economic contraction, which should offer portfolio protection if the economy slows more than we expect. The quality tilt also aligns with our preference for US technology companies, which should be among the key beneficiaries of AI-related demand for both hardware and software. Quality stocks typically have higher valuations than the overall index, but we think that quality is worth paying for in 2024. Investors can find quality stocks within US tech; stable quality-income and high-quality cyclical stocks in Europe; and in select names in Asia.\" Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to see which stocks with extreme revenue growth are on the radar of billionaire investors.  For this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with EPS growth of over 30% over the past five years, sales growth of over 25% over the past five years and quarter-over-quarter sales growth of over 25% posted in the most recent quarters. From these stocks we selected 11 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. To find the number of billionaire investors for these stocks we used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of billionaire investors and their stock holdings. Why care about billionaires and hedge fund managers? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11. Sunshine Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:SBFM)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 1\n\nSunshine Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:SBFM) ranks 11th in our list of the hyper-growth stocks billionaires are loading up on. In November Sunshine Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:SBFM) posted third quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at -$0.04. Revenue in the quarter totaled $5.96 million.\n\n10. Agile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 1\n\nAgile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX) makes contraceptive products. Agile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX) posted third quarter results in November. Total revenue in the third quarter came in at $6.7 million, an increase of 122% from the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at -$1.47, beating estimates by $0.37.\n\nOne billionaire in Insider Monkey's database of billionaires had stakes in Agile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. Billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is a shareholder in Agile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX).\n\nThe company talked in detail about its financial performance during Q3 earnings call in November:\n\n\"In the past year, we’ve seen consistent quarter-over-quarter improvements across all of our key performance areas, and we believe there is room for additional growth both in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as into the first quarter of 2024. I’ll now get into some of the details of our third quarter 2023 performance that supports our confidence in achieving our 2023 net revenue goal and generating positive cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2024. Net revenue, third quarter 2023, net revenue was $6.7 million, which represents a 21% increase from the second quarter of 2023. The continued increase in net revenue was primarily driven by our ability to once again accelerate Twirla demand across both the retail and non-retail channels.\n\nTwirla demand for the third quarter 2023 was 74,325 total cycles a 33% increase from the second quarter of 2023, a new single quarter record. Retail demand as reported by Symphony was 40,196 total cycles, a 13% increase from the second quarter of 2023, also a single quarter record. Non-retail demand was 34,129 total cycles, a 71% increase from the second quarter of 2023.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 2\n\nMassachusetts-based Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO) ranks ninth in our list of the hyper-growth stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Spero Therapeutics Inc's (NASDAQ:SPRO) revenue jumped about 1175% on a year over year basis.\n\nTwo billionaires in Insider Monkey's billionaires database had stakes in Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO). Billionaires Israel Englander and Jim Simons had stakes in Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO) through their hedge funds.\n\nThe company's management talked about important business updates and its cash position during Q3 earnings call in November 2023:\n\nSpero is well capitalized with a strong financial position of $93.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023. This includes the $30 million milestone we announced on our last earnings call, which has now been received as part of the Tebipenem HBr License Agreement with GSK. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund the company into the second half of 2025. We reported total third quarter revenues of $25.5 million compared with revenues of $2 million in the third quarter of 2022, a $23.5 million increase compared to the prior year period that was primarily a result of the $23.2 million of collaboration revenue related to the license agreement with GSK.\n\nCurrent revenue was $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $0.9 million in the same period in 2022. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2023 were $16.4 million compared with $7.4 million in research and development expenses for the same period in 2022. This $9 million year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher direct costs related to the Tebipenem HBr and SPR720 programs. These included increased clinical activity related to our ongoing Phase 2a trial of SBR720, as well as startup clinical activities and increased preclinical activities related to the planned Phase 3 trial of Tebipenem HBr. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2023 of $5.7 million were lower than the $6.6 million reported in the same period in 2022.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n8.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) stock ended 2023 and started 2024 on a downbeat note as some analysts raced to outsmart themselves with various downgrades of the iPhone maker based on concerns about slowing growth in China and other headwinds.\n\nYet, Apple is up around 8% since January 5 and approaching its mid-December records heading into its Q1 FY24 earnings release on February 1. Apple’s recent wave of upward earnings revisions help AAPL earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nApple is certainly no hidden gem, but who cares? The moral of our story today is that it pays to keep it simple and buy shares of one of the true Wall Street titans as part of a healthy, well-rounded portfolio.\n\nApple is far more than an iPhone maker these days. Plus, AAPL is trading above all of its key short-term and long-term moving averages.\n\nRecent Negativity\n\nA few notable analysts downgraded Apple stock over the last month or so. Their concerns focused on slowing iPhone sales, with a particular focus on China, among wider fears about an increasingly saturated high-end smartphone market. There are also constant worries about legal battles regarding its App Store and more.\n\nApple is facing mounting competition from rival Huawei Technologies in the world’s second largest economy. AAPL is also suffering setbacks in the Chinese market, as are many other companies across various industries, due to the broad-based economic slowdown in China. Geopolitical fears play their part as well. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAAPL’s overall sales declined YoY during the trailing four quarters, with total FY23 revenue down 2.8% (its third YoY decline in the last eight years).\n\nDespite the mounting concerns about Apple’s business in China and its economy more broadly, AAPL’s revenue in China only slipped by roughly 2.2% in fiscal 2023 (vs. Apple’s wider 2.8% drop). Apple’s total iPhone revenue fell by over 2% last year, and smartphone sales climbed by 2.8% in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe iPhone and Beyond\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s branding power remains nearly unmatched and its constant cycles of new phones and devices keep people wanting more. Many consumers upgrade to new iPhones and other devices habitually, even if there isn’t a game-changing difference, and would never think of leaving the Apple universe.\n\nApple sold $200 billion worth of iPhones in FY23 up from $142 billion in FY19. Apple’s long-term growth case is not difficult to make in a world full of smartphone addicts, especially as its subscriptions grow within its key services unit.\n\nChief executive Tim Cook has focused on transforming Apple beyond an iPhone maker by continually making money from its loyal and growing customer base. Apple’s services segment climbed by 9% in FY23 to account for 22% of sales, making it by far the biggest segment outside of iPhone. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple said last quarter that it had an installed base of “over 2 billion active devices,” which “continues to grow at a nice pace.” AAPL’s services efforts go beyond its App Store and include Netflix and Spotify competitors, a subscription news offering, Apple Wallet, a video game platform, digital workout classes, and more.\n\nAAPL finished its most recent period with “over 1 billion paid subscriptions across” its services, marking nearly double the number it had three years ago. On top of that, Apple has brought more of its chips in-house and it is quietly spending heavily on rolling out AI features in its smartphones and other devices.\n\nNear-Term Outlook\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) reported upbeat results on January 18 and provided strong guidance that signals a return to growth for the smartphone market. Apple’s revenue is projected to climb by 3% in FY24 and jump 6% higher in FY25 to reach $418.36 billion vs. $383.29 billion in FY23.\n\nMeanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to grow by 8% in FY24 and another 9% higher next year to come in at $7.19 per share. This would come on top of marginal EPS growth last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple has topped earnings every period over the last five years outside of a small miss in the first quarter of FY23.\n\nBetter yet, Apple’s earnings revisions have trended higher over the last month for FY24 and FY25, with its most accurate/most recent estimates solidly above the already-improved consensus. The bottom line positivity helps it capture a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.\n\nPerformance, Technical Levels & Valuation\n\nAAPL stock is up around 8% since January 5 and it trades 6% below its average Zacks price target and around 2% under its mid-December records. The rebound took Apple back above its 50-day and 21-day moving averages and from oversold RSI levels to above neutral.\n\nApple shares have climbed by roughly 1,000% in the last 10 years to top Microsoft (MSFT) and blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 275% run. Apple is only up 36% in the past three years vs. Microsoft’s 75%.\n\nAAPL has also underperformed Tech during the last 12 months, which means it might be less overheated than some might assume. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple is currently trading above its very long-term 21-month moving average and it appears far from overheated by historical RSI standards.\n\nValuation-wise, Apple trades at a roughly 20% discount to its five-year highs at 28.8X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its median or Tech.\n\nBottom Line\n\nApple returned $25 billion to shareholders last quarter via buybacks and dividends. The firm is also still investing heavily in future growth endeavors such as artificial intelligence, EVs, and beyond.\n\nSome investors might decide they would rather attempt to find the next Apple. But sometimes betting on the favorite works better than going with the underdog.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Adds details in paragraphs 2-3, 5-10, 12)\n\nBy Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh\n\nBEIJING, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Apple's smartphone shipments in China shrank 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023 from the same year-ago period, hurt by intensifying competition from local rivals led by Huawei, data from research firm IDC showed on Thursday.\n\nThe drop underscores the challenges facing the U.S. firm in its third biggest market, as some Chinese companies and government agencies limit employees' use of Apple devices, a measure that mirrors U.S. government restrictions on Chinese apps on security grounds.\n\nHuawei, whose smartphone business was decimated by U.S. sanctions, also made a comeback last year with new launches, intensifying competition in the world's biggest smartphone market that grew just 1.2% in the final quarter of 2023.\n\nHuawei's shipments increased 36.2% in the last quarter of the year, the IDC figures showed. The company became the fourth largest smartphone vendor in China in the period with a 13.9% market share, up from 10.3% in the same year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year 2023, however, Apple overtook Vivo to become the top smartphone seller with a 17.3% market share, according to IDC. This marks the first time Apple became the top seller in China, but analysts predict its sales will come under pressure again this year.\n\nIDC said Apple's high-end market share in China has been impacted by rival products and limited product upgrades by Apple which reduced the overall attractiveness of iPhones.\n\nIt said Apple still attracted demand from many consumers through substantial discounts and promotions carried out through third-party distribution channels.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple offered rare discounts on its iPhones, cutting retail prices by as much as 500 yuan ($70) amid growing competitive pressure.\n\nJefferies analysts predicted earlier this month that Apple's shipment volumes would continue declining by double digits in 2024, while Huawei is seen bolstering its market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey estimate Huawei will ship around 64 million smartphones worldwide in 2024, a significant rise from fewer than 35 million units projected for 2023.\n\nOverall, shipment volume in China's smartphone market was 73.63 million units in the fourth quarter. For the full year, shipment volume was 271 million units, down 5%, IDC said.\n\nApple releases its quarterly results next week.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s iPhone was the top-selling smartphone series in China for the first time last year, a surprisingly strong showing in the face of fierce local competition and expanding government prohibitions against the American company’s technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Fails to Convince Tesla Investors to Overlook Slow Growth Boeing Growth Plans Arrested as Regulator Freezes Output Hikes Russia Says Ukraine Downed Plane Carrying Prisoners for Swap How Yemen’s Houthi Attacks Are Hurting the Global Supply Chain\n\nThe iPhone ranked first in shipments in the fourth quarter and 2023 overall, market tracker IDC said. It came after several analysts, including Jefferies, said iPhone sales tanked in the fourth quarter due to a lull in enthusiasm for the Cupertino, California company’s latest generation of hardware in the world’s biggest smartphone market. IDC also noted rising competition from domestic names like a resurgent Huawei Technologies Co., but timely discounts and promotions helped reduce the harm for Apple.\n\nSuccess in the fourth quarter was largely a matter of declining less than competitors, the IDC data showed. For the year, Apple’s 2.2% drop in 2023 was better than local rivals like Honor Device Co. and Vivo — both of which suffered double-digit slumps — and the overall 5% fall in shipments.\n\nThe year marked the lowest volume of smartphones in China in a decade, due to a soft economic recovery and weak consumer sentiment, according to IDC. It was also highlighted by Huawei’s return to prominence with its Mate 60 series, catapulting it back into the top five makers in China in the holiday quarter, with a 36% jump in shipments.\n\n“Apple’s climb to the top spot in 2023, especially in light of renewed competition from Huawei and the soft spending sentiment, marks a tremendous success,” said IDC research analyst Arthur Gao. “Apple achieved this thanks to timely price promotions in its third-party channels, which stimulated demand.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple also took the crown of the world’s biggest smartphone seller in 2023, after iPhone sales slumped less than Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy smartphones. Still, the iPhone 15 family of products is facing headwinds in sustaining demand in China, where analysts forecast sales will continue to weaken.\n\nSee: IPhone Sales in China to Fall Double Digits, Jefferies Says\n\nChinese agencies and government-backed companies ordered staff to stop bringing iPhones and other foreign devices to work, Bloomberg News reported in December, expanding prohibitions against such technologies in sensitive sectors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors It’s the Tesla Earnings Call—Time for Elon Musk Bingo Can America’s New Union Hero Take on Elon Musk’s Tesla?

        "content": "Tim Cook, boss of Apple, is having a rough start to 2024. In the past month his company has faced an unusual barrage of unpleasantness. A patent dispute forced it to remove features from two of its smartwatches. It found out that America’s Department of Justice (DoJ) would be suing it shortly over antitrust transgressions. It reported that it was losing market share in smartphones in China, its second-biggest market. Adding insult to injury, a few Wall Street analysts said something that would have been unthinkable until recently—that Apple’s shares were overvalued. On January 11th Microsoft, a rival tech titan, duly dethroned the iPhone-maker, temporarily, as the world’s most valuable company.\n\nThe run of bad news may continue on February 1st, when Apple reports its latest quarterly earnings. Equity researchers estimate that its revenues barely grew in the last quarter of 2023, if at all. Then, on February 2nd, Apple will be tested once again. It will start shipping the Vision Pro, an augmented-reality (AR) headset that it has been working on—and talking up—for a few years. The high-end gadget, which will sell for $3,499, represents a big bet on a new technology “platform” that, Apple may be hoping, could one day replace the smartphone as the core of consumers’ digital experience—and the iPhone as the source of its maker’s riches. Early indications hint that Apple should worry about the device’s prospects. Netflix, Spotify and YouTube have announced that they will not make their popular streaming apps work on the headset. None said why. But it could be because they all compete with Apple’s own streaming services, and developing an AR app is likely to be costly.\n\nMr Cook can brush off some of these worries. Despite everything, Apple’s share price has not moved meaningfully in January. A few days after being overtaken by Microsoft, it reclaimed its heavyweight stockmarket title—and its $3trn valuation. And if the Vision Pro’s launch is a flop, the short-term effect on Apple’s revenues will be nugatory, given the headset’s limited initial production.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, Apple’s boss would be unwise to dismiss the new year’s niggles. For they point to larger challenges for the company. These fall into three broad categories: antitrust and legal issues; slowing iPhone sales; and growing geopolitical tensions. None of these is existential right now. But each carries with it a risk of causing a big upset. Could they cost Apple its position as the world’s most valuable company for longer than a week or so?\n\nThough Apple’s market value has been among the world’s top ten since 2010, until a few years ago it traded at a low valuation relative to profits. It was thought of as a maker of hardware, a business that is more difficult to scale than software. For much of the 2010s its price-to-earnings (p/e) ratio, which captures investor’s expectations of future profits, was below 20, comparable to that of HPE or Lenovo, boring computer-makers with low growth and tight margins. It was also below the average for big American companies in the S&P 500 index (see chart 1).\n\nThis started to change around 2019, notes Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein, a broker. Revenue from Apple’s “services” business, which provides software to its devices’ 1bn or so users, began to grow. The two biggest parts of this category are an advertising business, which Bernstein puts at $24bn a year (including around $20bn a year from Google for making the search engine the default option on Apple’s devices), and the App Store (another $24bn). Services also includes Apple Music and Apple TV, its streaming offerings, as well as a fast-growing payments business. All told, revenues from services amount to $85bn a year, or a fifth of total sales. In 2016 they contributed just $24bn, or a tenth of overall revenues (see chart 2).\n\nThis helped convince investors that Apple was no longer a stodgy hardware provider. It was a software platform, where new paying users could be added at little extra cost. That meant higher profits—the gross-profit margin for Apple’s services arm is 71%, compared with 37% for devices—and more recurring revenue. As services became a bigger part of the business, Apple’s overall profitability swelled, too, from 38% in 2018 to 44% last year. That was also aided by the fact it was selling more high-end, high-margin iPhone models. All of this helped lift Apple’s p/e ratio to around 30, comfortably above the S&P 500 average and higher than that of Alphabet (Google’s parent company), though still below Microsoft’s (38) and Amazon’s (72).\n\nOne set of risks that could undo Apple’s p/e progress has to do with its legal headaches. Some, such as the patent problem, look like minor threats. In October the International Trade Commission ruled that Apple infringed patents related to an oxygen-measuring sensor that were owned by Masimo, a medical-device maker. Apple stopped selling the models which contained the offending technology. But on January 18th it started to sell them again, minus the disputed sensor.\n\nApple’s bigger legal problems have to do with its services business. In March new rules will come into force in the EU, a huge market, that force Apple to allow apps to be installed on its devices without going through its App Store. That makes it harder for it to charge the 30% fee it levies on most in-app purchases (Apple has filed a lawsuit against the rules).\n\nIn America, the DoJ is reportedly looking into whether Apple’s smartwatch works better with the iPhone than with other smartphones and why its messaging service is not available on rival devices. If, in a separate case against Google, the courts agree with the DoJ that its default-search deals with device-makers are anticompetitive, Apple could be deprived of roughly $20bn a year in virtually free money. As a result of a lawsuit filed in 2021 by Epic Games, a video-game developer, Apple has already had to change the way the App Store charges developers to sell apps there.\n\nThe orb is in your court\n\nApple is not defenceless in the legal battles. It quickly found a workaround to the Epic-induced changes to its App Store policy that lets it keep collecting hefty fees. A final ruling in the DoJ’s case against Google is probably years away. The same is true of its expected case against Apple. As with many antitrust cases against big tech, investors seem nonplussed.\n\nThe company is more vulnerable to the second area of concern—its slowing core business. According to a poll of analysts, Apple sold about 220m iPhones last year, barely more than the 217m it shifted in 2017. In 2024 the number might not be much higher. For a while, Apple could offset the slowing volumes with higher prices. But annual revenue growth has slipped to 1% in the past three years, down from an average of 9% between 2012 and 2019.\n\nSome rivals are trying to eat into Apple’s market share in high-end devices by exploiting consumers’ appetite for ChatGPT-like “generative” artificial intelligence (AI). Samsung, a South Korean tech titan, said that it would launch a new range of AI-powered phones by the end of January. Flashy features will include real-time voice translation and turbocharged photo- and video-editing. The devices may be on sale eight months before Apple’s next iPhones. Apple, by contrast, has said little about its plans for the hottest thing in tech since, well, the iPhone. “We’re investing quite a bit,” Mr Cook noted cryptically on the company’s most recent earnings call.\n\nApple is also being given a run for its money in China, the source of 17% of its overall revenues. According to Jefferies, an investment bank, Apple’s share of smartphones in the country declined last year. Meanwhile that of Huawei, a domestic tech champion, grew by around six percentage points. In August Huawei stunned industry-watchers—and America’s government, which has for years barred sales of American technology to the firm on national-security grounds—by launching the first 5G device containing advanced chips that were Chinese-made rather than imported. Patriotic shoppers in China snapped up the phone and, for good measure, other Huawei devices.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, worries about Apple’s progress may be overstated. Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, points to signs that the company is indeed investing quite a bit. In October the firm’s boffins and researchers at Columbia University jointly released an open-source AI model called Ferret. Two months later Apple published a paper about how such models could run on smartphones, which are much less powerful than the data centres typically used for the purpose. In January a South Korean tech blogger reported that an update to Apple’s operating system possibly as early as June would include AI enhancements for Siri, Apple’s robot assistant. Rumours swirl that Apple is planning to use generative AI in its own search engine.\n\nChina represents a bigger threat—and not just because of a revitalised Huawei. Apple’s plans for future growth depend in large part on success in emerging markets, including the biggest one of all. Mr Cook kicked off Apple’s past three earnings calls by talking about the company’s sales outside the rich world. China was doubtless on his mind.\n\nApple is also exposed to China risk through its supply chain. Despite much-publicised efforts to move some production to India, around 90% of iPhones are still manufactured in Chinese factories. So are most Mac computers and iPads. Mr Sacconaghi of Bernstein says that Apple will be hugely exposed to a serious geopolitical escalation, such as a conflict over Taiwan, for at least the next five years.\n\nEvents short of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could also hurt the company. The return of Donald Trump to the White House, a serious possibility now that he has all but wrapped up the Republican nomination, would almost certainly raise barriers to trade and heighten Sino-American tensions. Even if Joe Biden defeats Mr Trump in the presidential election in November, he is hardly a China dove. The Chinese government is beginning to hit back against American sanctions. It has already banned products made by Micron, a chipmaker from Idaho, from some infrastructure projects. In September reports surfaced of a ban on Apple products among government officials. Although the authorities later denied the claims, the episode put investors on edge.\n\nAny Chinese action that hurts Apple in China would hurt China, too. Apple says 3m people work in its supply chain. Many of those workers are Chinese. One analyst likens Apple’s position vis-à-vis China’s government to “mutually assured destruction”. The same could be said of the commercial balance between America and China. Try explaining that to Mr Trump.\n\n© 2024 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss dividend stocks with the biggest buyback programs. You can skip our detailed analysis of buyback programs and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with the Biggest Buyback Programs.\n\nShare buybacks refer to the process by which a company repurchases its own shares from the open market. By repurchasing shares, a company can return excess cash to shareholders and optimize its capitalization. US companies have hesitated to buy back their own shares due to the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation by increasing interest rates, leading to higher borrowing expenses. Bloomberg Intelligence reported that share buybacks have experienced a decline for five consecutive quarters following a peak in 2022. However, in one of our articles titled 11 Stocks with the Biggest Buyback, we highlighted that the resurgence of share buyback activity is becoming prominent. This is attributed to the Federal Reserve's potential readiness to reduce interest rates and an anticipated improvement in earnings growth forecasts. Investors are optimistic that, with these factors in play, more companies will utilize their recently freed-up capital by engaging in stock market investments. In addition, our coverage included information from a Wall Street Journal report citing VerityData's data, indicating that accelerated share repurchases (ASRs) were poised to achieve their second-highest quarterly performance since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis aligns with the latest report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which noted that share repurchases in Q3 2023 amounted to $185.6 billion, marking a 6.1% increase compared to the $174.9 billion spent in the preceding quarter. Analysts express confidence in the potential for robust buyback activity throughout the current year. They believe that increased buyback activity could have positive implications for shareholder value, earnings per share, and overall market performance. Analysts at Deutsche Bank anticipate that even at their presently restrained rate, buybacks are expected to contribute to generating annual returns in the range of 7% to 8% for the S&P 500 index. In a research note dated January 12, strategists from the bank penned their insights or analysis. Here is what they say:\n\nStory continues\n\n“The key reason buybacks remain subdued is the continued overhang of cyclical uncertainty with the consensus of economists steadfast in their forecast for a sharp and imminent slowdown. However, further increases in earnings as in our forecast should prompt increases in buybacks.”\n\nDividend companies in the US are actively participating in share buyback programs. While dividends involve distributing a portion of the company's profits to shareholders in cash, buybacks involve using company funds to repurchase its own outstanding shares from the market. Both mechanisms are ways for companies to return value to shareholders. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some of the best dividend stocks with the biggest buyback programs. They are highlighted alongside other noteworthy companies in the list below, all recognized for their strong combination of dividend payments and substantial share buybacks. 10 Dividend Stocks with the Biggest Buyback Programs\n\nPhoto by nick chong on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn this article, we used a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices that gathered information on stock repurchases in 2022 and 2023. From this comprehensive report, we identified 10 dividend-paying companies that had the greatest dollar value of share buybacks in the 12 months leading up to September 2023. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiment data for these stocks where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. Deere & Company (NYSE:DE)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$7.24 Billion\n\nDeere & Company (NYSE:DE) is an American company that operates in the agricultural, construction, forestry, and turf care industries. On December 6, 2023, the company declared a 9% hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.47 per share, which was its second dividend growth for the year. Moreover, it has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders since 1990. The stock has a dividend yield of 1.51%, as of January 24. In the past 12 months ending September 2023, the company carried out $7.24 billion worth of share buybacks, which makes DE one of the best dividend stocks with the biggest buyback programs.\n\nAt the end of Q3 2023, 55 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Deere & Company (NYSE:DE). compared with 56 in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is more than $3.07 billion. With roughly 4 million shares, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\n9. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$7.57 Billion\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a global pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, and manufacturing of biopharmaceutical products. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share, having raised it by 5.3% in December 2023. This marked its 18th consecutive year of dividend growth. The stock has a dividend yield of 4.76%, as of January 24. It is one of the best dividend stocks with the biggest buybacks on our list.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of Q3 2023 showed that 65 hedge funds owned stakes in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), compared with 66 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $1.8 billion. Among these hedge funds, Two Sigma Advisors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nMadison Investments mentioned Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and The Walt Disney Company. We added Texas Instruments as a new position. Bristol-Myers has been dealing with the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid, one of its key products. Although the company is launching new drugs in melanoma, heart failure, and psoriasis it will need additional products to offset the lower revenue in Revlimid.”\n\n8. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$7.6 Billion\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks with the biggest buyback programs in the 12-month period ending September 2023. The American financial services company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.48%, as of January 24. In the most recent quarter, the company returned $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends.\n\nAs of the close of Q3 2023, 109 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), growing from 106 in the preceding quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $6.6 billion.\n\nVltava Fund mentioned JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“Last spring, the US went through a brief banking crisis that cost several smaller and medium-sized banks their lives. One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations. That is why we hold JPM.”\n\n7. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$9.7 Billion\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a global technology company that operates in the financial services industry, specializing in payment solutions. The company is a major player in the payment processing industry. On December 6, 2023, it declared a 16% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share. Through this hike, the company achieved its 11th consecutive year of dividend growth. In addition to this, the board has given its approval for a fresh $11 billion share repurchase initiative, which makes MSFT one of the best dividend stocks with the biggest buyback programs. This program is set to take effect upon the conclusion of the company's previously disclosed $9 billion repurchase program.\n\nAs of the end of September 2023, 140 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), compared with 139 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $15.2 billion.\n\n6. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$11.2 Billion\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) ranks sixth on our list of the best dividend stocks with the biggest buyback programs.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 dividend stocks with sustainable payout ratios. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the importance of payout ratios, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with Sustainable Payout Ratios.\n\nInvestors have traditionally shown a strong preference for dividend stocks because of their ability to generate income. When seeking stocks that provide a steady income stream, investors often lean toward companies that have a track record of consistently increasing their dividends over time. Such companies typically maintain low payout ratios, indicating robust cash generation capabilities. Payout ratio is a measure indicating the percentage of a company's net income or free cash flow that is distributed as dividends. A lower payout ratio is generally considered favorable because it implies that the company has the potential to sustain or even increase its dividend payments in the future. Adam Kramer, who oversees the Fidelity Multi-Asset Income Fund, discussed payout ratios in a report. Here is what he said:\n\n\"It's important to analyze the stability of a company’s cash flows when assessing the level of payout. When the payout ratio is more than 50%, you always stress test that ratio.\"\n\nA high payout ratio indicates that a company is allocating a substantial portion of its earnings towards dividend payments, resulting in a reduced amount of funds available for potential investments in the future growth of the business. In a study conducted by Wellington Management, dividend-paying stocks were categorized into quintiles based on their dividend payouts. The top 20%, known as the first quintile, comprised the highest dividend payers, while the bottom 20%, the fifth quintile, included the lowest dividend payers. The second quintile stocks showed better performance than the S&P 500 Index in eight out of the 10 time periods from 1930 to 2022, while the first and third quintile stocks tied for the second place, outperforming the Index 67% of the time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe study revealed that the success of second-quintile dividend-paying stocks could be attributed to the sustainability issues associated with the excessive dividend payouts of the first quintile. Additionally, the average dividend-payout ratio since 1979 for the first two quintiles of dividend payers within the Russell 1000 Index was highlighted in the study. The first-quintile stocks had an average dividend payout ratio of 74%, while the second quintile had a more moderate 40% average payout ratio. Maintaining a high payout ratio, such as 74%, may pose challenges for a company if it undergoes a decline in earnings. In such circumstances, the company might be compelled to reduce its dividend, a move often interpreted in financial markets as a sign of weakness. This reduction frequently leads to a decline in the company's stock price.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) are some of the best MLP dividend stocks with sustainable payout ratios discussed among others in this article. 10 Dividend Stocks with Sustainable Payout Ratios\n\nPhoto by Scott Graham on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds as of Q3 2023 to find stocks with sustainable payout ratios popular among hedge funds. Our focus was on companies that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. From this initial selection, we narrowed down the list to include only those companies with a 5-year average payout ratio below 30%, indicating a robust cash position. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\n\n5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 28.7%\n\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is a multinational company primarily engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of paint, coatings, and related products. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.605 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.79%, as of January 23. It has been growing its dividends for the past 44 consecutive years. The company's 5-year average payout ratio comes in at just 28.7%, which makes SHW one of the best stocks with sustainable payout ratios.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 71 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), compared with 78 in the preceding quarter. The overall value of these stakes is roughly $3 billion. With nearly 1.5 million shares, D E Shaw was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\n9. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\n5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 9.81%\n\nThe Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) is a global health services company that operates in various segments of the healthcare industry.

Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“In the attractive healthcare sector, we look beyond the obvious to identify businesses that simultaneously have exposure to this growth industry and also trade at low prices. We’re especially drawn to companies like Cigna Group, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices. Furthermore, recognizing that the constantly rising cost of healthcare cannot go on forever, we have been particularly drawn to companies whose products or services play some role in managing or reducing the cost of care. As a result, we have positions in Cigna Group, a well-regarded provider of managed care.\n\n8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\n5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 23.3%\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks with sustainable payout ratios. The American multinational financial services company is known for its credit card, charge card, and traveler's check businesses. The company has been paying uninterrupted dividends to shareholders for the past 34 years and currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share. The stock's dividend yield came in at 1.29%. Over the past five years, its average payout ratio stood at 23.3%.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of Q3 2023 indicated that 74 hedge funds owned stakes in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), up from 73 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are worth over $25.6 billion in total. With over 151.6 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.\n\nOakmark Funds mentioned American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. The firm made the following comment:\n\n“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.”\n\n7. S&P Global Inc.

        "title": "Satya Nadella’s triumphant tenure hits a new peak as Microsoft tops $3 trillion in market value—its stock is up 1,006% since he took over",
        "content": "Microsoft continues its AI-powered march to the top of the corporate food chain. On Tuesday, the Washington software giant’s market cap crossed the $3 trillion mark, making it only the second company in history to record such a feat, alongside its old rival Apple.\n\nThe news comes just two weeks after Microsoft even overtook Apple to become the world’s most valuable company, although Apple regained its spot shortly afterward. The two companies, famous competitors since the dawn of the computing revolution half a century ago, have been neck and neck for the top spot in corporate America since the beginning of the year. In fact, understanding their decades-long competition is key to understanding just how instrumental Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been in taking the rivalry into this new, $3 trillion era.\n\nFor years, Microsoft languished behind Apple, as the Cupertino giant rolled out hit after hit—from the iPod to the iPhone to the Apple Watch. Microsoft risked being left behind in the industry that it helped create with the invention of Windows and Microsoft Office, both products that became bywords for computing in the 1990s as Microsoft leapfrogged the early computing giant Apple, with its trademark Macintosh desktops. As it sought to regain its luster in the new millennium, Microsoft tried to enter a series of new markets, such as phones and search to name a few, racking up a series of flops.\n\nThen, in 2014, current CEO Satya Nadella stepped into the role, revived the company’s culture of innovation, and led the company back to the mountaintop. Investors have rewarded Nadella’s turnaround, with Microsoft seen as exceptionally well positioned for the artificial intelligence boom. Its Azure cloud services division provides much of the cloud computing power that AI developers use to power their products, such as Meta’s Llama2 model. While its widely coveredpartnership with OpenAI means its fortunes are linked with the startup considered to be the market leader in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far this year, Microsoft's stock is up 7%, capping an astonishing 1,006% increase under Nadella’s leadership, according to Fortune calculations. Widely considered to be the architect of Microsoft’s turnaround over the last 10 years, Nadella pivoted the company to cloud computing and orchestrated its massive $10 billion deal with OpenAI back in 2019, years before it became a sensation with the release of ChatGPT to the public. The decision to partner with OpenAI was a masterstroke, foreseeing the AI revolution before others, and positioning Microsoft ahead of its competitors.\n\nThe tech industry as a whole is fueling much of the stock market rally. The so-called Magnificent Seven—which in addition to Microsoft includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla—accounted for 60% of the gains on the S&P 500.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Apple’s 2024 is off to a rough start",
        "content": "We’re less than a month into the new year, but it feels like it’s been a heck of a lot longer for Apple (AAPL) watchers. The tech giant has been making headlines left and right as it juggles a handful of downgrades to its stock price, faces required major changes to its App Store policies, and gears up for a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business.\n\nAll of this comes as Apple prepares to launch its $3,499 Vision Pro headset. Apple’s most ambitious product in years, the Vision Pro catapults the company into a product category that even established players like Meta (META) have struggled to turn into a hit.\n\nIt’s a lot to say the least.\n\nBut it’s not all doom and gloom for Apple. Generative AI-equipped iPhones and a re-acceleration of the company’s services business should help goose growth in the years ahead. And if the Vision Pro takes off, it would provide an entirely new revenue stream across both Apple’s hardware and services segments.\n\n“I don't think Apple's in any way under any existential threat right now that didn't exist before,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “It's just that they're participating in markets that [have] slower growth and they're looking for ways to try to juice that growth.”\n\nApple’s China slowdown\n\nChina is Apple’s third largest market, generating $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. North America, Apple’s biggest market, generated $162.6 billion, while Europe generated $94.3 billion.\n\nAll this makes reports of a slowdown in iPhone sales in China perhaps Apple’s biggest and most pressing story. A sluggish economic recovery coupled with a resurgent Huawei, which despite US sanctions has managed to put out smartphones with modern processors and features, are expected to hurt Apple’s market share in the country.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, the iPhone maker controlled 15% of the Chinese market in Q3 2023. That was slightly better than Huawei’s 14%, but behind Vivo’s 16% and Oppo’s 19%.\n\nStory continues Apple's iPhone 15 Pro on display at the company's headquarters in Sept. 2023. REUTERS/Loren Elliott/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nAnalysts at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic each pointed to the region as a potential problem for Apple with Barclays’ Tim Long saying that the firm saw “incrementally worse” iPhone 15 data out of China. He also added that he doesn’t predict any “features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling.”\n\nRedburn Atlantic’s James Cordwell also called out China in a Jan. 10 note, saying that he remains concerned about Apple’s competitive position in the country.\n\nPiper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar and Robert Aguanno said that the deteriorating macro environment in China could weigh on Apple’s handset business.\n\n“We highlight in our outlook that China is a key swing factor for sales next year,” Aguanno told Yahoo Finance. “Any recovery in expectations for iPhone growth will be fueled by either the reemergence of the Chinese consumer along with outsized growth in other emerging markets such as India.”\n\nAntitrust concerns and App Store changes\n\nApple is also contending with reports that the Department of Justice is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the company. According to The New York Times, the department could file the lawsuit, which would focus on Apple’s strategic hardware and software moats, as soon as March. The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after it's unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCritics have long called on antitrust enforcers to take action against Apple for establishing policies that prevent users from accessing apps from third-party app stores or keep device and app makers from using certain hardware features of Apple’s iPhone, such as its mobile payment technology.\n\nThe European Union is also attempting to force Apple to loosen restrictions on its App Store, including allowing third-party app stores on the iPhone. The company has also set up new App Store rules in the US that allow developers to advertise third-party links for making app purchases outside of the App Store. Apple, however, will still charge a commission on those sales but will lower the amount from 15% or 30% to 12% or 27%.\n\nThat drew a sharp rebuke from long-time rivals like Spotify who say Apple’s changes don’t go far enough.\n\nThe Vision Pro is a risky bet\n\nApple’s new Vision Pro AR/VR headset is also a major part of its 2024 equation. The device, which is available for pre-order and hits the market Feb. 2, is a huge gamble for Apple, as it looks to enter a completely new market.\n\nWith a starting price of $3,499, the Vision Pro won’t reach the kind of sales volumes as the iPhone. And while early reports say pre-orders have sold out, there’s no guarantee that interest in the spatial computer will remain high. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n“Initial sales data upon the device launch is encouraging to us but we would still be cautious about the long-term prospects for the device,” Aguanno said. “It’s too early to tell here.”\n\nThat said, Apple’s long-term prospects remain strong, the analysts said. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan told Yahoo Finance Live that he has a high degree of conviction that Apple will continue to move higher in the coming years.\n\n“Primarily it’s about generative AI on iPhones,” he said. “We think that’s going to be a major catalyst.” Mohan further added that he believes the Vision Pro will have long-term potential on the hardware and services fronts.\n\nAguanno offered a similar take on the company’s future outlook, saying Apple’s market positioning and product set is solid.\n\nWe’ll get our first taste of Apple’s 2024 performance when it reports its earnings on Feb. 1.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple’s EV could be facing yet another delay—and it could end up coming to market at the worst possible time",
        "content": "Apple’s decade-long journey to bring an electric vehicle to market looks to be delayed once again, and it could be yet another sign of CEO Tim Cook, a master salesman, having less success as a product person. The Apple car, codenamed Titan and T172, could be one of Cook’s last attempts to make his mark before retiring and it’s been fast-tracked under reported pressure from the board. The trouble is that it may still be years away—and when it comes to market the EV space will have lost its shine, and the car may be a far cry from its initial vision.\n\nThe EV project has been in the works for years, prompting rumors of an industry-changing product, but people with knowledge of the project told Bloomberg that the company has not only stripped the car down from its previous design but also delayed its release by two years to 2028.\n\nTo be sure, Cook’s record at Apple includes presiding over the most highly valued firm in the history of capitalism. Apple’s market cap has grown to $3 trillion, from about $360 billion when he took over. But in his more-than-decade-long tenure, the company just hasn’t brought to market a revolutionary product on par with those of his legendary predecessor Steve Jobs, those being, of course, the iPod and iPhone.\n\nApple did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nShifting priorities\n\nWhile at one point the company envisioned the car as a fully autonomous vehicle capable of driving on any terrain, its latest iteration would instead have features that more closely mirror Tesla’s existing autonomous steering and braking capabilities, people with knowledge of the plans told Bloomberg. After the initial release, Apple may still upgrade its autonomous capabilities, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe mentality shift from exceeding current technology to replicating what already exists is reminiscent of Apple’s run of nearly identical iPhones, which seem to get minimal upgrades each year. The iPhone strategy has proved lucrative for Apple and Cook as the product consistently brings in about half of the company’s revenue every year, but it's clear that it needs another hit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s shares surged last year but still underperformed compared to other high-flying tech stocks as sales for some of its popular products stalled—and it was famously overtaken, albeit briefly, by Microsoft, which has now joined it in the $3 trillion club. iPhone sales over the summer were the slowest in a decade, and China’s economic woes led to a worse-than-expected performance in the company’s biggest overseas market.\n\nAdding to the company’s troubles last year was a temporary pause in sales for the Apple Watch 9 and Ultra 2 smart watches just before the winter holidays. The pause, which has since lifted pending Apple’s appeal, came after the U.S. International Trade Commission claimed that Apple’s watches infringed upon patents held by a medical device company.\n\nHesitation in the EV sector\n\nAs Cook’s Apple goes all in on its electric-vehicle project, the bloom is coming off the rose within the existing auto industry. Despite an 18% increase in EV sales in 2023, led by the F-150 Lightning, Ford’s electric vehicle division is losing around $1 billion every quarter. In October, the company postponed a $12 billion investment in electric vehicles. General Motors, meanwhile, has ditched an earlier target of making 400,000 electric vehicles by mid-2024 amid uncertainty in the sector.\n\nTesla, which is responsible for about half of the EV sales in the U.S., cut prices multiple times last year as electric vehicle demand weakened. A rare bright spot for the market is China’s BYD, which recently surpassed Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs.\n\nYet even the chairman of one of the biggest car companies in the world, Toyota’s Akio Toyoda, predicts demand for electric vehicles will max out at about 30%. To make matters worse, fewer electric vehicles will be eligible for a federal tax credit in 2024 thanks to tougher domestic manufacturing requirements imposed by the Biden administration.\n\nApple’s quest to bring an electric vehicle to fruition may be just the push the company needs to boost sales, but it will need to deal with multiple headwinds and some stiff competition to get there. Yet it wouldn’t be the first company to look to the automotive industry as the race to improve autonomous vehicles heats up.\n\nAlphabet’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary Waymo raised $2.5 billion in outside funding in 2021 and said in a filing that it planned to expand its autonomous taxi operation to Los Angeles, according to Reuters. In China, tech giants Huawei and Xiaomi have both announced their own vehicles.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

But it later closed at $402.56, valuing Microsoft at $2.99 trillion, just below the threshold price of $403.65 that would have kept it above $3 trillion.\n\nApple's shares pared earlier gains and closed down 0.35% at $194.50, giving it a market value of $3 trillion, according to LSEG data.\n\nBacked by its investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is widely seen as a frontrunner in the race for market dominance in the rollout of generative artificial intelligence (AI) among other tech heavyweights, including Google owner Alphabet, Amazon.com, Oracle, and Facebook owner Meta Platforms.\n\nUsing OpenAI's technology, Microsoft has rolled out newer versions of its flagship productivity software products as well as its Bing search engine, which is expected to better compete with Google's dominant search offering.\n\nApple, on the other hand, is facing slowing demand for its iPhones, particularly in China, where the company is offering customers rare discounts to boost sales amid stiff competition from homegrown rivals such as Huawei Technologies.\n\n\"I think it's AI optimism for Microsoft,\" said Stifel analyst Brad Reback, adding that Apple doesn't seem to have the same \"clear AI story\" coupled with concerns about iPhone sales growth rates and penetration.\n\nThe 54 analysts covering Microsoft's stock have a median price target of $425, up from $415 a month ago, and their average recommendation is \"buy\", according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuoyed by AI optimism, Microsoft shares gained nearly 57% in 2023 and are up 7% this year. Apple's stock rose by 48% last year and is up about 1% year-to-date.\n\nWall Street's run-up to record highs will be put to the test in the coming weeks as megacap U.S. technology-related companies begin reporting results.\n\n(This story has been refiled to adjust year-to-date gains for Microsoft and Apple in paragraph 10)\n\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Additional reporting by by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; Editing by Mark Porter, Bill Berkrot, David Evans and Jonathan Oatis)",

        "content": "Apple AAPL has emerged as a major player in the movie industry thanks to impressive content. It recently won a record 13 Academy Award nominations, including ten for Killers of the Flower Moon.\r\n\r\nThe Martin Scorsese directorial was the first Apple Original Films release to have a wider theatrical run, garnering roughly $150 million in global box office sales.\r\n\r\nKillers of the Flower Moon has garnered nominations across multiple categories, including Best Picture, Best Director and a historic nomination for Best Actress for Lily Gladstone, who has become the first Native American to be recognized in this category.\r\n\r\nThe movie, set in the world of the Osage Nation, also earned nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography.\r\n\r\nIndigenous artists Robbie Robertson and Scott George have also made history with their first-ever nominations in the Best Original Score and Best Original Song categories, respectively. Scott George, a member of the Osage Nation, became the first of his tribe to receive an Academy Award nomination.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Martin Scorsese's nomination for Best Director places him in the annals of history as the most-nominated living director, amassing a total of ten lifetime Academy Award nominations.\n\nApple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAdding to Apple's triumph, Ridley Scott's epic feature Napoleon secured three nominations in the categories of Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects.\r\n\r\nThis year's 13 nominations mark a significant milestone for Apple, more than doubling its previous record for Academy Award nominations in a single year. Since its launch just over four years ago, Apple has become one of the most-nominated studios for this year's Oscars.\r\n\r\nThe historic nominations for Killers of the Flower Moon follow Apple's notable wins at the 2022 Academy Awards with CODA, making history as the first motion picture starring a predominantly deaf cast in leading roles to win Best Picture. The success continued in 2023 with The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse winning the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film.\r\n\r\nKillers of the Flower Moon has received widespread acclaim, earning nine BAFTA Film Award nominations and being named the Best Film of the Year by the National Board of Review.

Total viewership surged 42% year over year.\r\n\r\nMovies and shows like The Family Plan, The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry, Messi Meets America, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Silo, Hijack, Bad Sisters and Ted Lasso drove consumption.\r\n\r\nMark Wahlberg-starrer The Family Plan, which premiered on Dec 15, became the most-viewed movie ever for the service since its launch. The latest season of Jennifer Aniston - Reese Witherspoon starred The Morning Show witnessed a viewership increase of 20% over the second season.\r\n\r\nApple shares have outperformed Disney but lagged both Amazon and Netflix in the past year.

        "content": "Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to release earnings results for its fiscal first quarter, after the closing bell on Feb. 1, 2024.\n\nAnalysts expect the iPhone maker to report quarterly earnings at $2.10 per share on revenue of $118.03 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nApple has requested a U.K. tribunal to dismiss a lawsuit worth close to $1 billion. The lawsuit, brought forth by over 1,500 app developers, alleges that Cupertino imposes unfair App Store charges.\n\nThe company also launched its newest iPhone software update, iOS 17.3, and it comes with several innovative features.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.49%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,219,875 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $243,975 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nView more earnings on AAPL\n\nAlso Read: Top 4 Consumer Stocks That May Collapse This Month\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.7% to close at $195.18 on Tuesday.\n\nRead More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

        "content": "Woodward, Inc WWD is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan 29.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $739.3 million, suggesting growth of 19.5% from a year ago. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.10 per share, indicating an increase of 124.5% from the prior-year levels.\r\n\r\nWWD’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, while missing in the remaining quarter. The average surprise stands at 14.7%.\n\nWoodward, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Woodward, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nWoodward, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Woodward, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe company’s performance in the fiscal first quarter is likely to have benefited from strong demand in both business segments. Also, strategic investments made to strengthen the supply chain are expected to have been other tailwinds.\r\n\r\nHigher commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket sales due to improving passenger traffic and fleet utilization are likely to have driven revenues in the Aerospace segment. The Aerospace segment is likely to have gained from higher defense activity.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial segment is likely to have gained from solid demand for power generation, especially in Asia, and continued requirement for backup power for data centers. Increasing investment in LNG infrastructure development and higher demand for alternative fuels across the marine industry are positives. The Industrial segment is also likely to have been aided by momentum in the global marine market brought on by higher utilization and rising shipbuilding rates.\r\n\r\nWe expect revenues from the Aerospace and Industrial segments to be up 15.5% and 20.4% to $456.9 million and $268.5 million, respectively, in the fiscal first quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, softness in defense OEM sales due to lower guided weapons sales is a major headwind. Low visibility into the China on-highway natural gas truck market, global macroeconomic weakness, forex volatility and rising costs are added concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for WWD this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nWWD has an Earnings ESP of -2.52% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With Favorable Combination\n\nHere are a few stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and carries a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.09 per share and $117.5 billion, respectively.

        "title": "4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Bet on as Dow Hits All-Time High",
        "content": "Wall Street has resumed its rally after starting January on a volatile note. All the major indexes officially entered the bull market last week, with the S&P 500 hitting an all-time high and recording its highest close since January 2022.\n\nOn Jan 22, the Dow extended its bull run and closed above the 38,000 mark for the first time. The Dow ended Jan 22 at 38,001.81 points. The blue-chip index crossed the 37,000 mark on Dec 13, 2023, and took less than a month to hit an all-time high.\n\nRising optimism that the Federal Reserve will soon end its monetary tightening campaign as inflation has declined sharply and a positive outlook from economists that the economy will have a softer landing than expected earlier has helped blue-chip stocks extend their rally.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 but left its benchmark policy rate unchanged in the range of 5.25-5.50% in its past three FOMC meetings.\n\nAlso, a dovish outlook from Federal Reserve officials that it will try not to keep interest rates higher for a longer period has raised optimism that rate cuts are on the anvil this year. Markets are now pricing in at least three 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThis bodes well for the economy as lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing and give more spending power to consumers.\n\nThe U.S. economy also expanded at a solid pace last year despite inflationary pressures. The third-quarter GDP grew 4.9% and expectations are high that the final quarter of 2023 also grew at a rapid pace.\n\nThis has seen consumer sentiment soaring to a two-and-a-half-year high. The preliminary index of consumer sentiment in January showed a reading of 78.8, surpassing estimates and the December reading of 69.7. The 13.1% jump also marks the fastest rise since December 2005.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven the positive sentiment and bright outlook, investors should bet on these four fundamentally strong blue-chip stocks, namely American Express Company AXP, Apple Inc. AAPL, International Business Machines Corporation IBM and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. These companies are strategically positioned to take advantage of the overall upward trend in the market. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express Company is a diversified financial services company, offering charge and credit payment card products, and travel-related services worldwide. AXP’s range of products and services include charge card, credit card and other payment, and financing products; Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants; Network services; other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs; Expense management products and services; and Travel-related services.\n\nAmerican Express has an expected earnings growth rate of 14% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days. AXP presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nApple Inc.’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio of AAPL, which includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod have gained significant traction.\n\nApple has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 60 days. AAPL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms. IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat, in particular, has helped it strengthen its competitive position in the hybrid cloud market. In addition, International Business Machinesprovides advanced information technology solutions, computer systems, quantum computing and super-computing solutions, enterprise software, storage systems and microelectronics.\n\nInternational Business Machines has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 60 days. IBM presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. MSFT dominates the PC software market, with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems. Microsoft Corporation’s Microsoft 365 application suite is one of the most popular productivity software globally. MSFT is also one of the prominent public cloud providers that can deliver a wide variety of infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service solutions at scale.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days. MSFT presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - Spotify users in Europe from March will be able to buy audiobooks and subscription plans from within the music-streaming app as a result of the region's new competition law for Big Tech, the Swedish company said on Wednesday.\n\nThe move will help the company avoid Apple's 30% fee for purchases through its App Store, which has long been a source of contention between app developers and the tech giant.\n\nSpotify has for years been in embroiled in a legal battle, alleging that it was forced to raise the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs tied to Apple's App Store rules.\n\n\"For years Apple had these rules where we couldn't tell you about offers, how much something costs, or even where or how to buy it,\" Spotify said in a blogpost.\n\n\"The DMA (Digital Markets Act) means that we'll finally be able to share details about deals, promotions, and better-value payment options in the EU.\"\n\nUnder the DMA, which all Big Tech firms must comply with by March 7, companies are obligated to treat their own products and services like they do rivals'.\n\nApple plans to challenge the European Union's decision to put all of App Store into the bloc's new digital antitrust list, Bloomberg News had reported in November.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple asked a London tribunal to throw out a mass lawsuit worth around $1 billion brought on behalf of more than 1,500 app developers over its App Store rules.\n\nApple had also drawn criticism from Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg who called App Store policies and fee structure as problematic and causing a conflict of interest.\n\n\"We've always been interested in helping developers distribute their apps, and new options would add more competition in this space,\" Meta said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Developers deserve more ways to easily get their apps to the people that want them.\" (Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAs we came into 2024, a lot of strategists were calling for a broadening of the stock market rally beyond the Magnificent Seven. Those calls sounded familiar, because we’ve been hearing them for at least the past year.\n\nBut the broadening hasn’t really materialized. And now the major averages are hovering at record highs.\n\nMaybe it’s time to put to bed the notion that the rally “needs” to broaden to be sustained.\n\nInfo tech and communications services are the two best-performing groups thus far this year. Utilities and energy and consumer discretionary are in the red, among other sectors.\n\nThe Seven (or really, Magnificent Six, since Tesla has slumped) has powered forward. Nvidia is still the standout, with a 20% jump this year on top of its nearly 240% rally last year.\n\nThat means that once again — but even more so — big-cap tech is responsible for the push to new records. The Magnificent Six have accounted for a whopping 89% of the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) year-to-date return through Monday’s close, according to Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre.\n\nBig Tech hasn’t reported earnings yet, so the stocks could take a hit when their numbers and forecasts come out. Both info tech and communications services are predicted to report year-over-year growth in both earnings and revenue, according to FactSet. It’s certainly possible that they won’t be able to meet the lofty expectations implied by the stocks’ run this year.\n\nBut that was frequently the narrative around tech earnings last year as well. As the refrain went, how could they possibly continue to gain, given what was being priced in?\n\nAnd then Meta leaped 194%. Tesla doubled. Amazon soared 80%. Microsoft rallied 57%. Alphabet rose 58%. Apple gained 48%. And Nvidia, as previously mentioned, more than tripled. For some investors, surprise at these numbers amounted to an utter failure of imagination.\n\nStory continues\n\nNone of this is to say the same thing will continue to happen. But it certainly makes one question the idea that it can’t continue to happen. morning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nA previous version of this story was corrected to fix the number of contributors to the 89% return in the S&P 500 this year.",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 35 richest countries by median income. If you want to skip our overview of the global economic environment, then head over to 10 Richest Countries by Median Income.\n\nEconomic Outlook for 2024\n\nThe richest countries by median income in the world tend to have a strong economic system that offers a wide range of jobs and business opportunities. The world’s most developed economies have suffered since the COVID-19 pandemic as things have not been the same since the pandemic. Despite the economic disruptions, the world has gone through a transformative decade of development with the practical application of technologies such as AI, Cybersecurity, Blockchain, and Metaverse, among others. However, the global economy is set to end 2024 on a downward side - the slowest half-decade of GDP growth in 30 years, as per the World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects report.\n\nCompared with 2023, the global economy is expected to get better with the risk of a global recession fading, mainly due to the strengthening of the US economy. But the increasing geopolitical tensions are creating havoc. Especially, in the Middle East, things seem all tense with Israel’s inhumane bombardment of Gaza and Iran’s proxies acting against Israel and its allies. In addition, the Russia-Ukraine war has entered a new phase almost 700 days after its beginning. On January 19, Reuters reported that NATO is launching its largest exercise since the Cold War, with the participation of nearly 90,000 troops. The drill is expected to begin in May and will rehearse NATO's execution of its regional plans, coming up against a potential response to Russian attack and European defense.\n\nThe medium-term outlook for many developing economies looks sluggish due to slowing growth in major economies, flat global trade, and tight financial conditions globally. According to the World Bank, global growth is expected to drop from 2.6% in 2023 to 2.4% in 2024, slowing for the third year in a row. Whereas, developing economies are projected to have a growth rate of 3.9% and low-income countries are expected to grow 5.5% in 2024. By the end of 2024, around 40% of people in low-income countries and people in one out of every four developing countries will still be poorer than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global economy is shifting its growth circle and Asia seems to be the strongest region heading forward. According to Goldman Sachs, China, the US, India, Indonesia, Germany, Japan, and the UK will be the leading economies in 2050. These economies are some of the richest countries by GDP per capita. By 2075, India will surpass the US to be the second-largest economy. Nigeria and Pakistan will replace Germany and Japan to be the fifth and sixth-largest economies in the world. The United Kingdom is tightening its immigration rules in 2024 to avoid a large inflow of immigrants and stabilize the country’s job market. Whereas, Germany is making its immigration more flexible as it needs a more skilled workforce. In the summer of 2023, Germany’s parliament passed the Skilled Immigration Act intending to quickly lower the barriers to immigration of skilled workers from countries outside the European Union.\n\nCompanies from the Richest Countries\n\nCorporations are one of the biggest resources of an economy and strong industries reflect the power of an economy. International Holdings Co. PJSC (ADX:IHC), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are the biggest companies from some of the richest countries in the world.\n\nInternational Holdings Co. PJSC (ADX:IHC) is the biggest public holding firm based out of the United Arab Emirates. On January 2, International Holdings Co. PJSC (ADX:IHC) announced the approval of a next-generation holding company to International Holdings. The new holding company, 2PointZero, will comprise multiple sectors with business combinations of entities under common control. 2PointZero is expected to have an asset size of over AED 100 billion. 2PointZero will cover sectors including technology and AI, financial services, investment banking, mining and resource management, and digital and crypto ecosystems.\n\nNovartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is one of the top Swiss multinational pharmaceutical firms. On January 5, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) reported that it had obtained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial manufacturing of PluvictoTM. The FDA’s approval of Novartis AG’s (NYSE:NVS) second US Radioligand Therapy (RLT) manufacturing facility increases RLT production capacity to 250,000 doses. The new RLT manufacturing facility is a 70,000-square-foot site based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Novartis AG’s (NYSE:NVS) new RLT manufacturing facility will add a substantial supply increase for the foreseeable future.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the biggest companies in the world by revenue. On January 20, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced the opening of its 100th retail location in the Asia-Pacific region. The company has opened Apple Hongdae in Seoul, South Korea. On January 11, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported that former president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, Dr. Wanda Austin, was nominated for election to Apple’s board of directors. Dr. Austin brings extensive science and technology experience to her role at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), said:\n\n“She’s an extraordinary leader, and her invaluable experience and expertise will support our mission of leaving the world better than we found it.”\n\nThese were a few top companies that are playing a massive role in both domestic and international economies. Now, let’s take a look at the richest countries by median income.  35 Richest Countries by Median Income\n\n35 Richest Countries by Median Income\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile and list the richest countries by median income, we obtained the data on median income by country from the Data Pandas, updated as of 2024. We have also highlighted the GDP (PPP) of the countries in the lists, which is taken from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) database, updated as of 2024. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) figures are used, and as a simple definition, PPP is calculated by subtracting price differences and nominal changes in the local currency and the US Dollar. We ranked the richest countries by median income in ascending order of their median income.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

If you want to, you can skip our detailed robotics industry analysis and go directly to our shorter list of the 5 worst industrial disasters in the world.\n\nIndustrial disasters are accidents that occur in industrial companies due to failure, negligence, or incompetence in handling chemical, mechanical, civil, electrical, or other processes. Since an industrial disaster involves dangerous chemicals and hazardous substances, it is a significant threat not just to humans, but also to the natural and infrastructural environment.\n\nToday, the industrial sector takes up a large portion of the world economy, making up 17.9% of the GDP of the United States, which is the largest economy in the world as of 2024. Over the decades, the industrial sector has maintained its position in the world economy. A detailed analysis of this conducted by the Industrial Analytics Platform further emphasizes the close link between industrial activities, economic growth, and sustainable development, and how industrial development will take a whole new level in the years to come.\n\nGiven the importance of the industrial sector, it is also important to note that if the balance is tipped, there can be a significant impact on the world economy. Throughout history, we’ve seen multiple times how industrial disasters trigger huge economic losses and destabilize sustainable growth.\n\nDisasters by Industry\n\nIndustrial disasters concern not just the manufacturing industries, but others as well. In 2022, the chemical industry’s total revenue, on a global level, stood at around USD 5.72 trillion, reaching the highest value in the last 15 years. The chemical industry is growing at an exponential rate, but a minor negligence or failure involving chemicals like in the Bhopal Gas Tragedy can lead to a catastrophe.\n\nSimilar to the chemical industry, the nuclear industry, which is responsible for generating 10% of the world’s electricity according to the World Nuclear Association, is also prone to disasters. For instance, in 2011, the Fukushima disaster in Japan was an eye-opener for many countries with nuclear energy plants. It dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economy, with its share of nuclear energy dropping from 29.2% in 2010-11 to 2.1% in 2012.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, the industrial sector continues to learn from past disasters and implement more safety precautions to safeguard the future. As world technology progresses, industrial workplace safety is enhanced and the risk of disasters is also minimized. One of the most effective solutions has been the incorporation of robotics technology as it can perform repetitive tasks faster and with much higher accuracy and precision than human workers.\n\nFor the same reason, using robots and automating industrial manufacturing has been a growing trend in recent years. In 2023, there were around 4.09 million units of service robotics and 450 thousand units of industrial robots worldwide. (See: 15 Biggest Robotics Companies in the World). While human workers are still needed in industrial manufacturing, robots and machines can be used to handle hazardous chemicals and dangerous tasks to minimize industrial disasters.\n\nOutlook: 10 Years From Now\n\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, economic growth has mainly come at the expense of the environment. While economies, populations, and resource demands grow continuously, the availability of resources remains the same, therefore urging industrial companies to adopt strategies in the modern world to uplift economies without exhausting natural resources.\n\nFrom human-centered processes to machine-reliant assembly lines to highly automated factories, industrial companies are adapting to new trends and transforming their methods. Some of the main reasons for adapting to new trends are to minimize the risk of disasters, improve efficiency, lower costs, and reduce material wastage.\n\nSome industrial companies are already incorporating Industry 4.0 in their manufacturing processes. For instance, HIROTEC Corporation, a major automotive supplier, uses the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for operational intelligence and predicting maintenance in its manufacturing machines and assets.\n\nSome of the key players in the manufacturing companies are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM), Samsung Electronics (KSE: 005930), and BASF SE (ETR: BAS). All these industrial companies are well-aligned with Industry 4.0 and use it in their process management. In fact, in 2017, Apple partnered with GE to bring iOS into Industry 4. In 2023, Apple took more initiatives including the first Smart Manufacturing Forum for SMBs in South Korea, to showcase its serious involvement in the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nOver the years, Apple has invested millions of dollars in automation technology, and it is not the only one. Today, all industrial companies are prioritizing technology and development to reduce the risk of disasters and become the key players in their sector. At the same time, they acknowledge that automation technology cannot replace the skill of human workers— even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) did, in their conversation with The Information.\n\nSo, with the risk of industrial disasters still there, it’s important to keep looking at the history, learning from it, and working to ensure better safety of the sector.\n\nHere, we have compiled a list of the 15 worst industrial disasters in the world.  15 Worst Industrial Disasters in the World\n\n15 Worst Industrial Disasters\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world, we analyzed a list of notable industrial disasters in the world and shortlisted the ones that incurred the most damage to human life and/or the economy. We ranked disasters based on the number of deaths caused by the disaster, going from the least to the highest. We’ve also discussed financial and industrial losses caused by each disaster.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

The Buncefield Explosion (2005)\n\nNumber of deaths: 0\n\nThe Buncefield Explosion of 2005 is the only industrial disaster on this list where there were 0 fatalities. Still, many people were injured. This disaster took place in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, near the M1 motorway.\n\nThe Buncefield explosion started in an oil storage facility due to three hundred tonnes of fuel leaking. Not only was the facility set ablaze, but the fire stayed burning for five days.\n\nThe aftermath included a hefty cleanup, destroyed properties, and around £1 billion in damage. Total UK, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, and the British Pipeline Agency (BPA)  were all fined after this disaster.\n\n14. Seveso Disaster (1976)\n\nNumber of deaths: 73,000 (farm animals)\n\nOn 10 July 1976, a chemical reactor exploded in the ICMESA plant located near Seveso, Italy. The disaster killed 3,000 farm animals immediately and left people with terrible health disorders. The explosion caused dioxins to leak into the area.\n\nWhile no human lives were lost as a result of the explosion, over 70,000 animals were euthanized to make sure no one would get harmed by the chemicals. To this day, the Seveso area is off-limits for any development.\n\nIn the aftermath of this disaster, Seveso experienced financial consequences due to environmental damage, decreased property value, livestock loss, and agricultural loss. Healthcare costs also increased because of skin diseases caused by chemicals.\n\n13. The Deepwater Horizon Explosion (2010)\n\nNumber of deaths: 11\n\nThe Deepwater Horizon Explosion of 2010 is known as one of the most significant oil spills and one of the worst industrial disasters in history. As a result of this disaster, 11 people lost their lives and 17 got severely injured.\n\nThe Deepwater Horizon rig is owned by BP PLC (NYSE: BP), a leading oil company. According to a report published by BP, the explosion was a result of many causes— all of which contributed to a wellhead explosion, the release of natural gas, and its eventual ignition at the rig. After the explosion, 1000 barrels of oil leaked into the ocean daily for 85.5 days.\n\nBP had to pay compensation of $20 million to the victims and families of those who lost their loved ones. A lot of damage was caused by this explosion, including thousands of marine animals dying. This explosion also left many people unemployed due to the lack of tourism in the petroleum-laden areas.\n\n12. The Texas City Refinery Explosion (2005)\n\nNumber of deaths: 15\n\nAnother tragic chemical explosion, the Texas city refinery disaster, was the result of a vapor cloud of chemicals catching on fire. One hundred eighty workers were heavily injured, and 15 lost their lives. This took place at a BP refinery in Texas when a vapor cloud exploded in its isomerization process unit.\n\nBP PLC (NYSE: BP) was sued for an environmental crime and charged a $50 million fine. BP PLC (NYSE: BP) also had to pay around $1.6 billion to compensate the victims. These continued until 2009 when OSHA charged BP a whopping $87 million fine.\n\n11. Phillips Disaster (1989)\n\nNumber of deaths: 23\n\nThe deadly Phillips Disaster took place in 1989 when high-flammable gasses caused multiple explosions at the Phillips Petroleum Company (NYSE: PSX). Twenty-three people were killed and 314 were injured. The fire lasted for 10 hours, damaging water pipes and making it harder to put out.\n\nThere was a loss of $715.5 million since the explosion damaged all of the facilities within the vicinity. The company also faced a $700 million disruption loss.\n\n10. Chernobyl (1986)\n\nNumber of deaths: 50+\n\nThe Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is one of the most known industrial disasters and even inspired a $40 million show by HBO. The miniseries depicted the atrocities of the disaster and helped create awareness regarding industrial disasters. It is available to watch on Apple TV+ (NASDAQ: AAPL) as well. The disaster took 50 lives and has left the entire area radioactive and inhabitable to this day. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone will be habitable again in 20,000 years.\n\nIn April 1986, an explosion occurred at a Chernobyl nuclear plant. Perhaps the worst nuclear disaster to ever exist, over $68 billion was spent to help with migration. Chernobyl is still radioactive, although some residents have returned to their homes.\n\nThere was a direct loss of $12.6 billion on the economic side. Around 784,320 hectares of land were destroyed, and food production in the area was banned. The disaster also caused significant electrical loss in places like Ukraine.\n\n9. Xiangshui Chemical Plant Explosion (2019)\n\nNumber of deaths: 78\n\nThe Xiangshui chemical plant produced chemicals such as pesticides and other organic compounds and has since shut down. Like the other disasters mentioned on this list, the plant ignored waste management and safety regulations warnings. Not only did they choose to ignore them, but there had also been previous fires at this plant.\n\nIn March 2019, an explosion took place, killing 78 people and destroying buildings nearby. The Xiangshui chemical plant was shut down soon after, and the district faces a property loss of around $100 million. There was also an economic loss of about $284.3 million.\n\n8. Centralia Mine Disaster (1947)\n\nNumber of deaths: 110+\n\nThe Centralia Mine Disaster is known as the second-worst mining disaster in the US, killing over 100 people. It took place in Centralia, Pennsylvania on 25 March 1947. The disaster started off with the electricity being cut off and thick black smoke surging through the mines. This then led to a large accumulation of smoke and a deadly explosion.\n\nPoor safety regulations and coal dust caused this tragic explosion. Out of 142 men, only 31 managed to escape. The mine had received previous warnings about the coal dust that was collecting, but they chose to ignore it.\n\nSome economic consequences faced after this disaster were compensation for victims, recovery investments, and safety regulations. According to a report by the UN, there was a temporary decline in coal production after the disaster.\n\n7. The Beirut Explosion (2020)\n\nNumber of deaths: 200+\n\nThe Beirut explosion is one of the most recent industrial disasters caused by an ammonium nitrate explosion in the capital of Lebanon. There were more than 200 deaths and 7000 injuries resulting from the incident which took place in 2020. This explosion was the cause of large amounts of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse without proper security measures. Lebanese authorities believe that welding work was what resulted in a fire which then led to the explosion.\n\nWhile some time has passed, Beirut still hasn't recovered from the explosion. Not only did this disaster weaken the local currency and push millions into poverty, but it also wrecked necessary infrastructure like ports. The economic loss caused by this incident was around $15 billion, with $3 billion going into infrastructure restoration. With the port destroyed, there was a lack of exports and imports, which the country relied on.\n\n6. Petrochina Chuandongbei Natural Gas Field Explosion (2003)\n\nNumber of deaths: 233+\n\nIn December 2003, PetroChina’s Chuandongbei natural gas field exploded in the municipality of Chongqing, China, killing more than 233 people and injuring over 10,000, putting it sixth on our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world. The blast was at such a catastrophic level that it nearly wiped out an entire village and caused other widespread damages.\n\nWhile there isn’t much information about how much PetroChina (HKSE: 0857) paid compensation regarding this case, there most likely would have been rescuing operation costs, property damages, and compensation for blast victims.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Top 5 Worst Industrial Disasters in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n24 Biggest Industries in the World in 2024 10 Best Industries to Work In According to Billionaires 15 Worst Performing Industries in 2023\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Worst Industrial Disasters in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors are still deeply divided over what the future might look like for the stock market in the weeks and months to come. While the bulls believe a soft landing is in sight, doubts remain over the Federal Reserve's possible plan of action regarding rate cuts as inflation remains sticky. A latest Wall Street Journal report cited CME FedWatch tool data which says there is now a 50% chance the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged during its March meeting. When 2024 was about to start this figure stood at just 3.85%. The optimism seen in the last quarter of 2023 was overwhelming and proved to be fickle. The WSJ report also said, citing swap contracts tied to the consumer-price index, that traders now see inflation at 2.4% over the next five years, the highest level since November. This shows we might be in for a long period of elevated inflation and high interest rates. In this environment, would mega-cap tech stocks like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which posted euphoric gains in 2023 be able to keep going higher? Only time would tell. For now let's take a look at the stocks that are trending these days. Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nAmid earnings, the beginning of the election buzz and upcoming economic data, it's interesting to see which stocks are currently trending in terms of high volume. For this article we used Yahoo Finance' stock screener which looks for mid-, small- and large-cap stocks with high trading volume and movement. From these stock we selected stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.  Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nStory continues\n\n13. Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nCrypto mining and digital assets company Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) has gained about 80% in value over the past one year amid a rebound in bitcoin.\n\nIn December, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) achieved record bitcoin production as Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) produced 1,853 BTC in the month, which was up 56% from November 2023. It was also a 290% YoY increase.\n\nOut of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 13 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA).\n\n12. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nLucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of the most shorted stocks in the EV space amid fears regarding production and uncertainty in 2024 due to upcoming elections. Earlier this month, the stock fell to an all-time low after Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) said it produced 2,391 vehicles during the last quarter of 2023 and delivered 1,734 vehicles, better than the analyst estimates for 1,696 vehicles delivered.\n\n11. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nAs US presidential elections 2024 inch closer, investors are starting to closely watch EV companies as a new government in the US could make or break EV stocks amid new policies. Analysts believe if Republicans come into power and make policies unfriendly to US EV companies, it would bode well for Chinese EV companies like Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) which would also plan faster expansion in other markets.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) during this period was Jos Shaver's Electron Capital Partners which owns a $38 million stake in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO).\n\n10. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nBrazilian mining giant Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) ranks 10th in our list of the top buzzing stocks to buy now. The stock is moving after Bloomberg reported that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants his former finance minister to be the next CEO of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\nIn December, Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) disclosed that its iron ore production of 310M-320M metric tons in 2024 will be flat when compared to  2023.\n\nA total of 34 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE). The biggest stakeholder of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) during this period was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $243 million stake in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\nMiller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world’s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any “unreasonable” price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year’s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company’s market cap.”\n\n9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) ranks ninth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Earlier this month Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) posted domestic Q4 sales volumes, with record electric vehicle (EV) numbers. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) sold 25,937 EVs in the period, a growth of 24% on a YoY basis.\n\n8. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 52\n\nAT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is buzzing as investors get ready to see the company's fourth quarter earnings report. Earlier in the month Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $21 price target.\n\nOppenheimer's analysts see several tailwinds for the stock, including AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 120MHz C-Band portfolio which now covers over 200M point of presence, or POPs. Oppenheimer said that about 60% of AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) subscribers are now fiber, which means healthier margins and pricing leverage.\n\nIn addition to AT&T, other stocks trending right now include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). AT&T is one of the most buzzing stocks to buy right now popular among hedge funds.\n\nMiller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.\n\nAT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”\n\n7. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is creating a buzz as investors get ready to receive Intel Corp's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings report slated to be released on January 25. Recently, a Gartner report said Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) ranked first in the list of top semiconductor companies in 2023, with a  total semiconductor revenue of $48.7 billion.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The most significant stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is owned by William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns a $468 million stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel ranks fifth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\n6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are creating a buzz on the Wall Street as investors await Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings that are set to be announced on January 24. The stock also came in the limelight after Elon Musk expressed his desire to have about 25% voting control over Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in order to make Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) a leader in AI and robotics. Tesla ranks sixth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Like Tesla, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also trending.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have gained about 47% over the past one year. Some analysts expect Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings to come in weaker than expected amid pricing wars in the EV sector.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nTsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable 11 Stocks Insiders and Billionaires Are Crazy About\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Nowis originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "2024 Oscar nominations were released on Tuesday morning, with Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer scoring the most nominations at 13. The nominations had a mix of traditional movie studios with streaming studios soaking up many of the nominations as well. \r\n\r\nYahoo Finance Reporter Alexandra Canal joins the latest to break down the 2024 Academy Award Nominations and what it means for the industry.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, Academy Awards nominations are out this morning with some very familiar names dominating the top categories. We're talking about \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" and of course, \"Barbie.\" Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's [? Allie ?] Canal to break it down for us. Allie, how does it all break down by studio?\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, Akiko, it seems like we have a mixed bag when it comes to traditional studios versus streamers. You teased \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Barbie.\" It looks like we're going to have another showdown between those two films with both of those movies securing a fair amount of nominations.\n\nHere are the top five. Universal's \"Oppenheimer\" coming in with 13 total nods. That's followed by Searchlight Pictures' \"Poor Things\" coming in at number two with 11 nods. Then a big showing from Apple here with Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" with 10 nominations.\n\nThen we have Warner Brothers' and Mattel's \"Barbie\" coming in at number 4 with eight nominations. Although I will say that Greta Gerwig was snubbed for Best Director along with Margot Robbie for Best Actress. And then rounding out the top five, we have Netflix with \"Maestro\" securing seven nods.\n\nNow, Netflix, as a studio, they've been steadily increasing their nomination count over the year, over the past few years. This year in particular, Netflix securing 18 total nominations. And if you think of where we were just a few years ago, streamers did not have a seat at the table. It was actually very difficult for them to even be considered for these award shows. And that was very important for them in order to secure the best directors, the best producers, the best talent.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, just a few years later, they certainly have become mixed with traditional studios. There doesn't seem to be that distinction anymore. And they've really come out swinging with a lot of solid hits. And I think this year's nomination list certainly proves that as well.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed, I mean, I've only seen one of those only because I don't have the energy to sit there for three hours. At least with streaming, you can sit down, take some breaks. So speaking of streaming, how does this latest award season impact Netflix? I mean, we've seen them making the most changes to their content strategy over the years.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Right. I mean, just this morning, we saw Netflix secure a deal with WWE, venturing into the world of live sports entertainment. And certainly with their film division, they're committed to it.\n\nWe did recently get the news that Scott Stuber who ran the film division, he will be exiting his role in March. He led some really great deals with \"Bird Box,\" \"Glass Out, Knives Onion,\" \"Red Notice.\" I mean, these are films that were housed in Netflix, Netflix original titles, that did very well. So I think moving forward, we're going to continue to see Netflix push for original content.\n\nThey recently paid $17 million in a bidding war at the Sundance Film Festival to secure the thriller \"It's What's Inside.\" So we're still seeing them spend a lot of cash for the movies that they think will create that sticky environment, will bring subscribers onto the platform. There's a lot of competition out there right now. And besides just original series, they need to make sure that they have a presence for original film titles as well. So I think we're going to see a lot of different types of films from Netflix moving forward as they look to compete with big tech along with those traditional studios.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So Netflix, at least for now, still holding that crown. Appreciate you and good to see you, our very own Allie Canal.",

        "content": "Badger Meter BMI is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 26.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1780.7 million, which suggests growth of 22.7% from the year-ago levels. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 80 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 33.3%.\n\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 10.3%.\n\nBadger Meter, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Badger Meter, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nBadger Meter, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Badger Meter, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe company’s performance in the fourth quarter is likely to have benefited from robust demand for smart water solutions and improving operating environment. Also, the company’s acquisition of Syrinix is likely to have acted as a tailwind.\n\nIncreasing demand for digital smart water solutions owing to changing secular challenges in the water industry is expected to have acted as a major tailwind. In the last reported quarter, utility water sales rose 31%, owing to strong demand momentum.\n\nRising adoption of E-Series volume, cellular AMI solution, ORION Cellular endpoint sales and higher BEACON Software-as-a-Service revenues are likely to have acted as major tailwinds. Also, solid adoption of water quality and pressure monitoring systems is a tailwind.\n\nHowever, the company’s performance in the fourth quarter might have been impacted due to rising global macroeconomic constraints. Increasing competition in the digital smart water solutions space and rising research and development costs are concerns.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for BMI this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\n\nBMI has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With Favorable Combination\n\nHere are some stocks you may consider, as our proven model shows that these, too, have the right mix of elements to beat estimates this time around.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple AAPL has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. Apple is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.09 per share and $117.5 billion, respectively.

        "title": "Western Digital (WDC) to Post Q2 Earnings: Key Factors to Note",
        "content": "Western Digital WDC is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan 25.\r\n\r\nFor the to-be-reported quarter, management projects non-GAAP loss per share to be between $1.05 and $1.35. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.13. WDC reported loss per share of 42 cents in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nWestern Digital expects non-GAAP revenues in the range of $2.85-$3.05 billion. The consensus estimate is currently pegged at $2.99 billion, indicating a decline of 3.7% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.\r\n\r\nThe company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing it in the remaining quarter. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 101.5%, on average.\n\nWestern Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nWestern Digital Corporation price-eps-surprise | Western Digital Corporation Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nWestern Digital is likely to have gained from efforts directed at operating expense management as well as adjusting production with supply and demand trends in the fiscal second quarter. To battle macroeconomic uncertainties, WDC is focused on reducing capital investments and operating expenses to better align cash flow and cost structure with market conditions.\r\n\r\nThe company expects overall revenues for the fiscal second quarter to have benefited from higher nearline HDD shipments and improved flash pricing. Margins are likely to have been positively impacted by lower underutilization charges.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter HDD revenues is pegged at $1.291 billion. WDC expects higher nearline shipments and seasonal demand in the consumer end market to drive sequential revenue growth for the HDD segment. The company is witnessing healthy adoption of SMR-based nearline drives (especially ultra-SMR hard drives 26-terabyte drive exabyte shipments).\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flash revenues is pegged at $1.666 billion. Management expects modest improvements in bit and average selling prices, along with a decline in underutilization charges, to drive sequential growth for the Flash unit. Also, the company’s performance is likely to have benefited from strong demand for client SSD portfolio, SanDisk as well as WD_BLACK offerings.\r\n\r\nHowever, soft consumer demand due to prevailing global macroeconomic uncertainties and inflation remain concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Western Digital this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nWestern Digital has an Earnings ESP of +6.94% and presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nHere are a few other stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. Apple is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.09 per share and $117.5 billion, respectively. Shares of AAPL have gained 36% in the past year.\r\n\r\nSeagate Technology Holdings plc STX has an Earnings ESP of +100.00% and presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. STX is slated to release quarterly numbers on Jan 24.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for STX’s to-be-reported quarter’s revenues is pegged at $1.55 billion. The consensus estimate is pegged at a loss of 8 cents per share. Shares of STX have rallied 39.9% in the past year.\r\n\r\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc AAL has an Earnings ESP of +43.10% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. AAL will release results on Jan 25.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Airline’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 6 cents per share and $13 billion, respectively.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever: January 2024",
        "content": "Even as the S&P 500 marks new highs, many top growth stocks haven’t seen the same momentum. Since most of the recent market gains come from just a handful of leading stocks, hidden opportunities in growth stocks abound. Some are small-caps, of course, and those represent the best long-term growth stocks as they have more room to run. Others, though, are firmly within the mid or large-cap categories. Still, they remain beaten down by factors outside of their control that have limited bearing on their overall future.\n\nThe worst growth stocks, generally, have already been pushed out of the market as the Fed’s interest rate hikes made unprofitable losers with limited prospects an endangered species. These stocks, therefore, have the short-term strength to stay afloat as we navigate whatever comes from today’s questionable economy while offering multi-bagger opportunities.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nIf there’s any growth stock destined to be part of the next era’s “Magnificent 7” equivalent, Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) might be it. Businesses today face innumerable challenges, including geopolitical conflict, natural disasters, and supply chain shocks. Despite these risks, the vast majority of business owners (small and large) rank cyber threats as the most important global risk they face. Those concerned about cyber threats, data breaches, digital infrastructure destruction, and ransomware attempts rank among the top specific threats.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike, a top cybersecurity stock, is positioned to grow to meet that threat as technology innovation demands more comprehensive security applications. The company already provides its tech to various governments, corporate entities, small businesses, and even school administrators. Better yet, the company’s revenue climbed substantially in each of the preceding five quarters while, critically, its past three quarters mark the first consecutive profitable periods. Though incremental, successive income boosts in an economy like today’s bode well for Crowdstrike as it remains at the forefront of digital security and safety.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold: Palantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of AI-powered tech stocks marking consecutive profitable periods, it’s impossible to talk about growth stocks to buy and hold forever without mentioning Palantir (NYSE:PLTR). The much-maligned company seems to have finally found its footing after SPAC-mania sent shares surging well beyond reasonable expectations before the stock plummeted in a drastic overreaction to the reverse.\n\nBut today, the stock has marked four consecutive profitable periods as a glut of corporate and government contracts validates the company’s position as a leader in data analytics, AI integration, and predictive forecasting. By marking its fourth profitable quarter, Palantir satisfies each of the requirements for S&P 500 inclusion. And, regarding market cap, Palantir is already more valuable than almost 300 companies within the index. If Palantir’s S&P dreams come true in 2024, expect significant momentum to carry the stock as more institutional investors wake up to its long-term potential.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nIf you had to guess the best-performing stock of the past few decades, go with one of the many big-name tech firms or even a Magnificent Seven stock. You wouldn’t pick a consumer-discretionary beverage brand, right? But Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is the best-performing stock of the past 25 years, returning a 31% annualized gain since 1998. By comparison, second-place leader Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) returned “just” 28% annually.\n\nWhile there’s still some steam left in Monster stock, the “next big thing” in beverage growth stocks is undoubtedly Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Better yet, as you’re reading this, a Bank of America downgrade sent pushed share prices down – representing an ideal entry point as the company consolidates and prepares for the next leg up. That leg up could come from Celsius’ aggressive expansion plans, which include inroads into Canada, the UK, and Ireland. A core concern within the Bank of America report pointed to flatlining market share in the US as the flooded market saturated consumers. But, by opening new growth avenues, Celsius is set to renew its rapid growth trajectory.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold: AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking for the high-risk/high-reward profile, pricing, and volatility that typifies many early-stage growth stocks, AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) gets top billing in today’s market. The space stock trades within penny stock territory and sells an incredible story – satellite-enabled, 5G cell service globally without needing physical cell tower infrastructure. The company’s concept proved viable last year after it completed the world’s first low-earth satellite 5G cell phone call with standard cell phones. The successful test marked a major milestone and pivot towards productization as the company plans its first commercial roll-out later this year.\n\nBetter yet, the company revealed major backers last week, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), and AT&T (NYSE:T). The three companies, alongside other backers, are infusing AST SpaceMobile with much-needed cash to fuel its next steps toward marketization.\n\nOf course, early-stage growth stocks tend to dilute existing shareholders in the fight for profitability, and ASTS is no exception. Though the above strategic funding deal (totaling more than $205 million) won’t dilute shareholders, a press release that came on the heels of the funding announcement revealed another $100 million in fundraising – from equity offering. The new equity offering dilutes existing shareholders by nearly 30%, and shares fell drastically on the news. The upside is that, operationally, ASTS’ prospects haven’t changed – they’ve only gotten better. If you’re in it for the long haul, a temporary share drop shouldn’t scare you off. And if you’re looking for growth stocks to buy and hold forever, today’s per-share pricing is a perfect entry point.\n\nHims & Hers Health (HIMS) The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nTelehealth companies offering “male enhancement” and hair loss solutions might not strike you as competitive for a running list of top growth stocks to buy and hold forever. But Hims & Hers Health (NYSE:HIMS) is a clear exception as the small-cap healthcare stock expands its offerings to capture emerging weight loss trends. To secure a larger market share and keep customers (patients) moving within a single integrated ecosystem, HIMS recently announced a partnership with Hartford HealthCare in Connecticut. The move takes HIMS out of the digital-only landscape. It lets customers secure in-person referrals for treatment beyond at-home basics like weight loss, drug therapy, and cardiovascular health management.\n\nRight now, the connection only serves Connecticut-based patients and customers. But the company claims to triage tens of thousands of patients daily and will now refer a handful of those eligible to its Hartford partner network. If the move proves sustainable and profitable, expect further expansion from this growth stock into the national sphere.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold: Unity Software (U) In this photo illustration the Unity Technologies (U) logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf all the virtual reality and Web3 enthusiasm that came and (seemingly) went, Unity Software (NYSE:U) stands as one of the few growth stocks in that specific sector with staying power, positioning itself to explode as the pendulum swings back towards VR and metaverse market interest. In the meantime, priced well below past highs, now is a great time to accumulate shares in this growth stock.\n\nUnfortunately, Unity is firmly in a “trim the fat” phase, and its recent workforce reduction points to some pain ahead as the company right-sizes itself to meet current market conditions and achieve operational efficiency. The move is just the latest in a multi-step series of “company reset” initiatives led by interim CEO Jim Whitehurst. Whitehurst is well known for turning Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) around in the early-2000s, and he’s well on his way to performing the same feat for the stellar software stock – just be ready for further turbulence as he and the board realize their collective plan to reorient Unity’s trajectory.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoing over growth stocks without mentioning Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is nearly impossible. Despite the company’s current troubles – including flagging EV sales and Elon Musk’s personal power struggles – there’s no doubt that the dominant EV manufacturer is set to keep expanding in the coming years.\n\nPerhaps most important to the company’s core operations, Tesla is embarking on an aggressive path to create an integrated vertical supply chain that isn’t dependent on outside forces. Those forces, including supply chain shocks and geopolitical maneuvering, are why the car market has seen so much volatility in recent years. To combat the trend, Tesla is creating an in-house lithium refinery to reduce the Chinese dependency that many other EV manufacturers face. Likewise, Tesla is cutting out rare earth metals from its batteries, cutting down on logistics complexity while improving its overall environmental impact.\n\nWe’ll likely see some further volatility for Tesla; practically speaking, this week’s earnings report is likely to be tough on shareholders. But shorts consistently lost when going against Tesla, and this current downturn is no exception.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Stocks Jim Cramer Recommended Selling, But Billionaires Love Them. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Stocks Jim Cramer Recommended Selling, But Billionaires Love Them.\n\nJim Cramer recently talked about the top themes of 2024 he's eyeing. Cramer said that he likes to talk about themes that investors can always fall back to. Cramer's top theme for 2024 is, unsurprisingly, AI. Related to this theme, Cramer talked about his expectations for this year and said that he's expecting a few stocks from the Magnificent Seven group to fall from their 2023 glory. Some Mag. 7 stocks Cramer has been recommending investors in 2023 include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nCramer Expects a Difficult 2024 for Tesla\n\nCramer said that Tesla will be first to go down in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks. Cramer criticized Elon Musk's latest demands in which he said he needs to take a 25% control of Tesla in order to make it a leader in AI and robotics. Cramer called this \"pure hubris.\" Cramer also talked about some research reports which believe Apple will have a terrible time in the start of 2024 amid problems in China.\n\nCramer's Thoughts on Donald Trump\n\nRegarding the election 2024 theme, Cramer said that there has never been a president more friendly for the stock market than Donald Trump was.\n\n\"He measured himself by the Dow,\" Cramer said of Trump.\n\nCramer said that Trump will \"fight for the rich like no other\" and the analyst expects the former President of the US to speak against capital gain tax, which Cramer thought would result in \"market soaring.\" Stocks Jim Cramer Recommended Selling, But Billionaires Love Them\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first listed down all the stocks Jim Cramer has been recommending investors to sell or stay away from over the past 12 months. From these stocks we picked stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. We used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of billionaires and their stock holdings to find the number of billionaire investors for these companies\n\nStory continues\n\n11. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 6\n\nJim Cramer has long been bearish on Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) and recommending investors to stay away from this stock. Recently, Jim Cramer made the following comment about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT):\n\n\"Let’s stop fooling around. If you want bitcoin, buy bitcoin. I think bitcoin’s topping out, by the way, so I’m going to say, enough is enough and ka-ching is ka-ching.”\n\nIn November 2023, Jim Cramer had said that Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) does not make any money and investors should own Bitcoin directly if they want to get exposure to crypto.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of billionaires shows that six billionaires had stakes in Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT).\n\nJim Cramer is bearish on RIOT but recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n10.

These are both new materials used as a base (substrate) on which to print power-oriented chip circuits. Shares fell during the quarter as the stock was trading at a premium valuation heading into the quarter, and investors were broadly concerned about underlying demand conditions in key end-markets like smartphones. Despite near-term concerns, the company reiterated its outlook to double revenues in 2023, reported strong design win momentum, and indicated opportunity pipeline growth. Navitas sells monolithically integrated GaN power integrated circuit chips (completed printed circuit systems on a chip), which provide greater reliability and performance compared to competitors that supply discrete power devices (multiple individual, larger components put together on a chip). It recently purchased a silicon control company to drive integration and performance even further, and its SiC products offer high performance across many different applications. The company’s high-power GaN product launches remain on track for data center, solar, and electric vehicle applications. We expect Navitas to gain share in the rapidly growing GaN and SiC power semiconductor markets over time, driven by its superior technology.”\n\n9.

        "content": "After experiencing a remarkable December, the Dow continued its upward momentum and closed above the coveted 38,000 mark for the first time on Jan 22. The 30-stock blue-chip index took only 25 trading sessions to jump 1,000 points to set a record close. The index surpassed the 37,000 milestone on Dec 13.\n\nIt’s the shortest time the Dow has taken to add 1000 points since the period between 33,000 and 34,000, per Dow Jones Market Data. Also, the move between 37,000 to 38,000 represented an increase of 2.7% for the 30-stock benchmark.\n\nDespite stretched valuation, the blue-chip stocks are climbing northward and have more room to rise due to the Federal Reserve’s dovish outlook and the rising optimism that the economy would avoid a recession this year.\n\nThe Fed has kept its interest rates unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5% and has hinted at rate cuts this year as inflationary pressure has begun to show signs of cooling down. The Fed’s intention to curb monetary tightening bodes well for the economy and, in turn, the stock market. This is because rate cuts boost consumer spending and reduce the cost of borrowing.\n\nThe U.S. economy, anyhow, is showing immense strength as consumers remain confident about their well-being amid a sturdy labor market. The University of Michigan stated that its consumer sentiment index had hit its highest level in January since July 2021. Americans are feeling optimistic about the economic scenario as jobs are being added at a steady clip and the unemployment rate remains low.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Association of Business Economics stated that almost 91% of the respondents have said that there is a 50% or less chance of the U.S. economy entering a recession in the next 12-month period. Many of them believe that corporate profits will rise this year as inflation is falling at a faster-than-expected pace, supply-chain bottlenecks ebb, and labor shortages ease.\n\nAmid such positives, it’s prudent for investors to place bets on fundamentally sound blue-chip stocks such as Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Salesforce, Inc. CRM and Apple Inc. AAPL that are well-positioned to capitalize on the broader market uptrend. These stocks have solid balance sheets, a steady stream of cash flows, and large market capitalization. They currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. Revenues from the intelligent cloud business, primarily driven by growth in Azure, are aiding Microsoft.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.1% over the past 60 days. MSFT’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.6%. Its projected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 15.5%.\n\nSalesforce is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Strong clientele and diverse products are benefiting Salesforce.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. CRM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 56.5%.

        "title": "18 High Growth Low PE Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the18 High Growth Low PE Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 High Growth Low PE Stocks.\n\nWhen value stocks came back with a vengeance in 2022, value investors cheered what they thought was the beginning of a long bull run of value stocks. But thanks to the AI boom, growth stocks rebounded in 2023. In a ten-year period ending 2021, the Russell Growth 1000 Index doubled the performance of the Russell 1000 Value Index. The so-called 'value investing' strategy has taken a hit amid an unending growth of technology stocks. But over the years the traditional boundaries between value and growth investing have faded. In fact, successful investors like Warren Buffett have long been saying that differentiating between value and growth does not make sense as they see growth a part of the broader value investing philosophy. Warren Buffett once said:\n\n\"There is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks as Wall Street generally portrays them, as contrasting asset classes. Growth is part of the value equation.”\n\nThere was a time Buffett stayed away from tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) saying he did not understand business models of these companies. But today he has huge stakes in some of the top tech companies in the US.\n\nRelying totally on PE ratios without paying attention to fundamentals and growth of companies is also not useful. For example, Oakmark in its September 2023 report on Value Vs Growth said the following which shows the importance of paying attention to both value multiples and growth metrics before making investment decisions:\n\n\"When we compare the 50 lowest ranked companies by P/E ratio on the S&P 500 today to the ones that made that list in previous periods, we don’t observe any decline in business quality. Therefore, considering both the relatively high price of the higher P/E companies and the solid business quality of the lower P/E companies—we believe that low P/E stocks today present a better hunting ground than they normally do. Last year we bought depressed stocks of high- growth businesses, such as Uber, at a double-digit free cash flow yield; Workday at a low price relative to sales; and Adobe at only a slightly higher than average P/E ratio. This year, after strong outperformance, we sold them and bought much lower P/E stocks. Here’s a fun way to think of it: In 2022, we bought a share of Adobe for about three shares of CVS Health. (CVS was just under $100 and Adobe under $300). This year we sold Adobe to buy more than six shares of CVS. (Adobe increased to well over $400 and CVS fell to $70.) We thought Adobe was cheap when we bought it, despite it being a high-growth business, and that CVS was fully priced when we sold it, despite it having a below-average P/E ratio.\"\n\nStory continues High Growth Low PE Stocks\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with PE ratios less than 15 and high revenue growth (over 25%) over the past five years and also in the most recent quarters. From these stocks we selected 18 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "title": "Samsung Races Apple to Develop Blood Sugar Monitor That Doesn’t Break Skin",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is exploring the development of noninvasive glucose monitoring and continuous blood pressure checking, setting its sights on ambitious health-care goals in a race with Apple Inc. and other tech giants.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlorida Governor DeSantis Drops Out of 2024 Race, Endorses Trump Hong Kong Stocks at 36% Discount Show True Depth of China Gloom Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Say Buy the Dip After Treasury Rout China Weighs Stock Market Rescue Package Backed by $278 Billion Never Trumpers Brace for New Hampshire Shutout\n\nThe work is part of a broader push to put health features in a range of devices, including its just-announced Galaxy Ring, said Samsung executive Hon Pak, who is overseeing the effort. The company aims to eventually give consumers a complete picture of their well-being via sensors on different parts of the body and around the home.\n\nHealth tracking is already a key selling point of smartphones and watches, with Samsung, Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google using the features to attract and retain customers. Creating sensors for continuous blood pressure tracking and glucose monitoring would be particularly valuable breakthroughs. Apple has been working for years on a glucose reader that wouldn’t require users to prick their skin for blood — a potential boon for millions of diabetics.\n\n“If we can do continuous blood pressure and glucose, we’re in a whole different ballgame,” Pak, Samsung’s mobile digital health chief, said during a wide-ranging interview. “I think that’s where everyone is trying to get to. We’re putting significant investment toward that.”\n\nHe wouldn’t comment on a timeline for either feature, but said he hopes noninvasive glucose monitoring could come to the market in some form within five years. “We are looking at everything from miniaturization to the various different technology platforms that can do some type of glucose monitoring or anything in between,” Pak said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe remarks follow Samsung’s announcement last week that it’s working on a ring with health sensors. The Galaxy Ring product is scheduled to be released before the end of 2024 and will come in a range of colors and sizes, Pak said. The company is eyeing activity and sleep tracking for the ring, with more health features to come later.\n\nSmart rings from companies like Oura offer an alternative for people who don’t like to wear a watch but still want to track their health metrics and sleep patterns.\n\n“The ring represents that community of people who want health tracking that is more comfortable and less obtrusive,” Pak said. “It’s meeting a need of a specific population of people who want to track and measure, but in a different way.”\n\nPak said Samsung hasn’t finalized pricing on the Galaxy Ring, but — like the company’s Galaxy Watches — it probably won’t be compatible with Apple’s iPhone.\n\nDeveloping a blood sugar monitor would be a more challenging task, but one that could have major rewards. Current products on the market typically require a blood draw or a prick in the skin — an obtrusive process. Apple has been working on a noninvasive approach since around 2010 and has since made major progress, Bloomberg News has reported. Even so, a product remains years away.\n\nRead More: Apple Has Plans to Eventually, Maybe Revolutionize Health-Care\n\nThe two companies also are working to improve blood pressure monitoring. Samsung smartwatches have long offered the ability to determine a user’s blood pressure, but the monitoring isn’t constant throughout the day and requires calibration against a standalone blood pressure checker.\n\nPak said Samsung is “evaluating all options” to improve its blood pressure features. The aim is to go longer without needing calibration. “We’ve been thinking long and hard about this,” he said.\n\nApple, meanwhile, is planning to add hypertension detection to its smartwatch later this year in a way that doesn’t require calibration but also doesn’t provide exact readings. Instead, the watch will inform users that they may have elevated blood pressure. Apple’s expansion into health technology hasn’t gone entirely smoothly. It recently pulled a blood oxygen feature from the Apple Watch after a legal setback in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp.\n\nPak said traditional blood pressure readings aren’t “really that meaningful” other than showing a range of normal and abnormal. “Whether it’s Apple or others, I think we are trying to redefine blood pressure in a way that it was originally intended, which is: How much cardiovascular risk do you have?” he said.\n\nSamsung also is exploring a range of different sensors for future versions of its earbuds. The company is studying new ways to measure body temperature and heart rates, adding that the ear is a closer pathway to the heart than the wrist. Data from the ear could be combined with wrist and ambient data to provide users with a more comprehensive picture of their health.\n\nMixed-reality headsets could be a new frontier for health as well, Pak said. Apple is poised to release its first product in that market next week when the Vision Pro goes on sale for $3,499.\n\nMeditation and mental health could be key areas for such devices, he said.\n\n“We are right now looking at partnerships to address that,” Pak said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Apple (AAPL) reached $193.89, with a +1.22% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.22%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.36%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.32%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 1.05% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.61% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on February 1, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.09, indicating a 11.17% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $117.49 billion, indicating a 0.29% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.60 per share and revenue of $393.49 billion, which would represent changes of +7.67% and +2.66%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.49% higher. As of now, Apple holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Apple is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 29.05. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 20.61.\n\nIt's also important to note that AAPL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.63. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. AAPL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.54 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 16, positioning it in the top 7% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "title": "After Mixed Bank Results and Economic Data, Can Tech Earnings Restore the Calm?",
        "content": "Mixed earnings results and strong economic data out last week induced some market jitters and a VIX that rose to its highest level in over two months.\n\nAfter lackluster big bank results at the kickoff of the fourth-quarter 2023 season, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) started off last week on a more positive note. Both handily beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom-line thanks to year-over-year improvements in asset management, investment banking and equities trading.[1] [2] Smaller U.S. banks, however, didn't fare as well. In order to compete with higher-yielding instruments, regional banks had to increase payouts on deposits to retain customers which lowered Net Interest Income (NII). Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW)[3], U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)[4], PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC)[5] and Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG)[6] all pointed to this in their results. In addition, these banks also saw a hit to the bottom-line from fees paid to the FDIC as they replenish the government insurance fund that was depleted after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last year.\n\nThen there was the better-than-expected jobs and consumer data out last week, continuing the trend of \"good news is bad news.\" On Wednesday, December Retail Sales increased 0.6% versus economists' expectations of 0.4%, pointing to a holiday shopping season that was more robust than previously thought.[7] On Thursday, Weekly Initial Jobless Claims came in at their lowest level since September 2022, showing that a tight labor market is still in play.[8] Markets retreated after both of these reports as investors are likely worried that a hot labor market and resilient consumer may mean fewer rate cuts in 2024. Expectations for a March rate cut dropped to 54% according to the CME FedWatch Tool.[9]\n\nComing to the rescue late in the week, however, were once again the tech stocks. A blowout report from the world's largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)[10], helped push the Nasdaq Composite higher for the week, and into positive territory for the year after getting off to a rough start. Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also added to that boost after Bank of America upgraded the stock to a buy.[11]\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the mixed earnings results from last week, the blended S&P 500 EPS growth rate fell to -1.7% from -0.1% the week prior.[12]\n\nCorporate Uncertainty Eases to the Lowest Level in Nearly 2 Years\n\nEven as the fourth-quarter season gets underway with some shaky results and commentary, our proprietary gauge of corporate uncertainty continues to sport a very low reading. The most recent reading of the Late Earnings Report Index (LERI) shows that fewer companies are delaying earnings reports than advancing them.\n\nThe LERI tracks outlier earnings date changes among publicly traded companies with market capitalizations of $250 million and higher. The LERI has a baseline reading of 100, anything above that indicates companies are feeling uncertain about their current and short-term prospects. A LERI reading under 100 suggests companies feel they have a pretty good crystal ball for the near-term.\n\nThe pre-peak season LERI reading for the fourth quarter (data collected in the first quarter) stands at 74, the lowest reading in nearly two years. As of Jan. 19, there were 55 late outliers and 67 early outliers. This is in stark contrast to the LERI readings from the second and third-quarter earnings seasons, which showed CEOs at their most uncertain since the Covid-19 pandemic. After Mixed Bank Results and Economic Data, Can Tech Earnings Restore the Calm?\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nAcademic research shows, for example, that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier would suggest the opposite.[13]\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an example of a company with an outlier date this week. T-Mobile is set to report Q4 2023 results on Thursday, January 25, six days earlier than expected. For the last two years TMUS has reported Q4 results on a Wednesday in the 5th or 6th week of the year, in the four years prior the company always reported on a Thursday in the 6th week of the year. This will be the first time they have reported in the fourth week of the year, and their earliest Q4 report date ever since they IPO'd in 2013.\n\nOn Deck this Week\n\nThe focus will move beyond financials this week as other sectors start to report their fourth-quarter earnings. Highly anticipated results from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be out Tuesday, Jan. 23 after the market closes. According to analysts polled by Factset, year-over-year EPS growth for Netflix is expected to come in at 1,742%, which would be the second-highest growth rate of any U.S. large-cap company this season after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nA closely watched Magnificent 7 component will also be out, when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reports Wednesday, January 24 AMC. Industrials such as 3M (MMM) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) will also report results, as well as big tech names International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). After Mixed Bank Results and Economic Data, Can Tech Earnings Restore the Calm?\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nQ4 Earnings Wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between Jan. 29 and March 1, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Feb. 22 is predicted to be the most active day with 599 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 47% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 10,000+ global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data. Keep in mind the Q4 reporting season is always a bit more prolonged, typically stretching over four or five peak weeks rather than the usual three peak weeks seen in Q1 - Q3.

        "title": "US-China Rivalry Keeps South Korean Chipmakers in Costly Limbo",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A memory chip plant located halfway between Seoul and Beijing illustrates the tough choices South Korean business leaders and policymakers face as they try to limit the damage from the US technology war with China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlorida Governor DeSantis Drops Out of 2024 Race, Endorses Trump Hong Kong Stocks at 36% Discount Show True Depth of China Gloom Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Say Buy the Dip After Treasury Rout Never Trumpers Brace for New Hampshire Shutout Gloom Over China Assets Is Spreading Beyond Battered Stocks\n\nSouth Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. bought its Dalian plant in northeast China from Intel Corp. in a $9 billion deal in 2020 that was supposed to help the world's No. 2 memory maker shore up capacity and expand into cutting-edge chips in the world's largest chip market. Instead, the factory has ensnared SK Hynix in a complex web of US restrictions aimed at limiting China’s access to materials and equipment considered key to dominating the battlegrounds and industries of the future.\n\nIn the years since the deal closed, SK Hynix has remained in limbo, unable to commit to big capex plans at the factory. The company had quickly built a shell for a new fab at the back of site, but it remains unclear if it contains any equipment to produce chips at all, let alone the advanced semiconductors that might secure solid returns on its hefty investment. Intel’s logo still sits atop the gleaming marine-blue glass façade of the factory complex, with the final payment for the plant due in 2025.\n\nThe company appeared to find a solution to its predicament in the fall after the US gave SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics Co. indefinite waivers to keep bringing some high-end equipment into China.South Korea’s government has attributed those concessions in part to President Yoon Suk Yeol’s charm offensive during his meeting with US President Joe Biden, aided by promises of investment and a surprise rendition of “American Pie.” The US side was also likely swayed by the need to keep major tech firms supplied with chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there’s no guarantee those waivers will stay in place, especially if Republican frontrunner Donald Trump wins November’s US presidential election and returns to the White House.\n\n“The SK Hynix plant in Dalian captures the difficult position South Korea chipmakers are in as a result of US restrictions,” said Masahiro Wakasugi at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Even with the latest US concessions it still probably doesn’t make sense for SK Hynix to expand capacity in Dalian given uncertainty over the US presidential election and US policy after that.”\n\nSouth Korea’s economy is heavily reliant on the semiconductor sector to drive growth. That makes it especially vulnerable to Washington's drive to cut supply chain dependence on China and constrain Beijing’s access to key chip technology. The International Monetary Fund has warned that South Korea would be the largest potential loser in the Asia-Pacific region if the two superpowers' economies were to decouple.\n\n“Korea needs to walk a delicate tightrope in balancing its relations with the United States and China,” said Troy Stangarone, senior director at the Korea Economic Institute. “It is at the forefront of critical technologies related to semiconductors and EV batteries that create economic opportunities, but also vulnerabilities for Korean firms.”\n\nThe SK Hynix factory in Dalian specializes in 3D NAND flash memory used in smartphones and other devices. NAND accounts for an increasing portion of the company’s revenue, around 27% of which comes from China. Including DRAM, South Korea has a combined global memory chip share of more than 60%.\n\nThe existing legacy output at the Dalian plant largely falls outside the US restrictions on advanced technology, but SK Hynix was likely looking beyond those parameters for the new fab to ensure its competitiveness over the longer-haul, according to BI’s Wakasugi.\n\nThe waivers from the US government allow SK Hynix and rival Samsung Electronics Co. to import US chip equipment while still leaving limits on the most advanced dual-use technology, although companies that receive Chips Act subsidies are barred from expanding advanced chip-making in China by more than 5% over 10 years.\n\nThe option of cutting losses and selling the plant would likely require US government approval and Washington is unlikely to green light the sale to a Chinese bidder.\n\nThe waiver \"considerably lowered\" the risks surrounding SK Hynix's operations in China, SK Hynix Chief Executive Officer Kwak Noh-jung said earlier this month at a press briefing. The company separately declined to comment on the implications of a possible Trump presidency and denied rumors it was looking to sell.\n\n“We are not considering selling our fabs in Dalian at all,” it said in a statement. “SK Hynix will maintain its China operations, while abiding by regulations and laws in the jurisdictions in which it does business and will do its part for the development of the semiconductor industry.”\n\nDiplomatic Drive\n\nFrom the moment the Commerce Department released its restrictions on use of advanced US chip technology just over a year ago, South Korean policymakers worked around the clock to negotiate with their US colleagues to try and hone their impact.\n\nPresident Yoon led the way with highly visible efforts to strengthen ties with Washington and repair relations with a shared US ally: Japan. A summit meeting with Biden in April was followed by a three-way Camp David meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in August.\n\nFor their part, SK Hynix and Samsung bumped up spending on lobbyists in the US as they tried to get their concerns reflected in Washington while also communicating closely with South Korea’s trade ministry.\n\nSouth Korean Trade and Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun views Yoon’s efforts as a game-changer that “substantially alleviated” the situation for chipmakers in China, laying the groundwork for Korean officials to convince US authorities that Hynix products from Dalian were innocuous.\n\nBut even with the “exceptional arrangement,” Ahn acknowledges that the outlook isn’t entirely clear for Korean chipmakers and other trade-reliant businesses.\n\n“Depending on unexpected geopolitical risk, you never know what kind of policy will come, right?” he said. “We still have a huge political risk in the coming years, not just in the US. Many countries are now waiting for new results of elections. So we do have many new political risks and, as a government, that is a big challenge.”\n\nApple Supplies\n\nThe decision to grant waivers for Samsung and SK Hynix to bring US equipment into China reflects the need to keep a steady stream of chips flowing to major US companies including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.\n\nApple gets almost 20% of its revenue from China and is SK Hynix’s largest customer, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis. The iPhone maker is also the biggest consumer of Samsung’s components even though the Korean company’s Galaxy phones are its biggest competitor.\n\nOn that basis alone continuing access to output from Korean factories in China remains crucial to the supply chain for many of Apple’s products.\n\nBut Washington maintains leverage over its ally as a guarantor of South Korea’s security and its largest trading partner after China. The US also has influence through its control of chip manufacturing knowhow and through the Chips and Science Act, which offers $100 billion in funds to firms building plants on American soil.\n\nAlthough neither firm has received any subsidies yet, SK Hynix has said it will invest $15 billion in a chip-packaging plant in the US, and Samsung, the world’s biggest memory chipmaker, has applied for money from the US for its planned plant in Taylor, Texas.\n\nThe US is the dominant player in half of 10 key chipmaking stages singled out by Bloomberg Intelligence including etching, plasma deposition and sputtering, with Japan and the Netherlands controlling the rest including wafer cleaning and lithography. That means South Korea’s key role as a chip manufacturer is dependent on technology, materials and expertise provided mainly by the US and its allies. To ensure they stay at the forefront of the chip sector, South Korean chipmakers need the collaboration of US firms, not Chinese companies.\n\nChina’s Grip\n\nSouth Korea has already seen what can happen when the US and China fight, with the nation’s economy collateral damage in a dispute almost a decade ago.\n\nA decision in 2016 to allow the US to deploy a ballistic missile system in South Korea sparked a furious reaction from Beijing, which punished South Korean firms in China and squeezed the flow of Chinese tourists as it tried to force Seoul to change its mind. The Chinese actions damaged economic growth, inflicted billions of dollars of losses on the Lotte conglomerate and triggered a slump in car sales from which Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp. never recovered.\n\nChina’s recent controls on graphite exports are another example of the country getting caught up in bigger geopolitical issues. While the actions was more likely a retaliation against US chip rules, the material is a key element needed by South Korea’s up-and-coming battery makers and is a reminder of the crosswinds buffeting Seoul from competition between its two largest trading partners.\n\nWhether to stay or go is the biggest concern among Korean companies running businesses in China, according to Ryu Jin, chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries. “The relationship with China is so important, so that’s why they are still contemplating what to do,” Jin said at a press conference in Seoul in late December.\n\nChina’s ascent up the value chain presents another cause for concern. Chinese smartphones and cars now outcompete South Korean equivalents, and that prompted a major withdrawal of Korean production in China, especially after the experience of the Thaad dispute. The experience of getting competed out of the market offers a glimpse of what the future might have in store for Korea’s chipmakers if they try to push ahead with advanced technology in China.\n\nAs some South Korean businesses reorient themselves away from the world’s second-largest economy, trade data shows a trend toward the US.\n\nWhile China is still by far South Korea’s biggest trading partner, monthly exports to the US surpassed those to China for the first time in more than two decades in data released at the beginning of 2024.That’s another indication that while South Korea is trying to keep its options in both China and the US as open as possible, it is already leaning more in the direction of the US as policymakers and firms change strategies to deal with a technology battle that is reshaping trade, supply lines and alliances across the globe.\n\n“Korea’s companies will need to make some tough decisions as it weighs the risks, pressures and opportunities emanating from both the United States and China,” said Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, who once led US trade talks with Seoul.“Even with these waivers, in many respects the handwriting is on the wall.”-- James Mayger and Sam Kim contributed to this article.\n\n--With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins, Ian King, Heejin Kim and Shery Ahn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "Apple's (AAPL) new high-end VR headset, the Vision Pro, launched pre-orders on Friday with a steep $3,499 price tag. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities estimates Apple logged between 160,000-180,000 pre-orders for the device over the weekend.\n\nThe Vision Pro marks Apple's first foray into VR/AR hardware, competing with Meta's (META) established Quest headsets which currently lead the consumer virtual reality market.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the details, analyzing how consumers may question the device's intended use-case.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Well, some calculations for pre-orders of Apple's Vision Pro headset are in, with one analyst estimating between 160 to 180,000 were sold over the weekend. The device went on sale at 8:00 AM Eastern time on Friday, it's set to start delivering in early March.\n\nLet's bring in our tech guru, Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan, that $3,500 price tag. Turns out people are willing to shell it out.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think a lot of early adopters, a lot of Apple fans, are probably the ones that are going in on this. Probably a lot of developers as well. Folks that just want to get in on this.\n\nObviously, the AR/VR market has been-- ups and downs. There was the original phase where people were just over enthused about it and then it kind of started to plateau a little bit. Meta is the market leader with their Quest line of products.\n\nAnd there's been various reports saying that after a few weeks, people don't really pick them up as much anymore or they just kind of sit in a box. So it'll be interesting to see what happens here with the Vision Pro and these people going out and buying one.\n\nI did a mock purchase, $3,500 a little rich for my blood at this point. But it showed that it would be delivered sometime in mid to late February. So obviously, the dates are being pushed back here on what people can get as far as the product itself goes.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd there's also been reports that some app developers aren't going to be putting their apps on the Vision Pro out of the gate. I believe Netflix being one of them, Spotify, some of the companies that haven't necessarily had the best relationship with Apple publicly, as far as the app stores go. And so those aren't going to be available when it comes to the Vision Pro itself.\n\nBut I guess that's not stopping people from going out and buying it. I mean, I got to try it back in June at WWDC. I really was impressed compared to what I've seen from other headsets, whether that's the Quest 3 or anything else, the prior generation PlayStation VR I had used. So it is truly impressive.\n\nI think the main question here is, what are you going to use it with, right? I mean, I keep kind of harping on this, I have a 65 inch OLED TV. I love it. It looks great. It's 4K. Everything looks awesome. I don't know if I need a-- and I'm a dork when it comes to screens, right. I'm constantly pestering my wife, what about this TV? Shouldn't we get one of these?\n\nSo it's not like I don't like this stuff but I just-- I think for me, I'm still trying to get the sense of where's the killer app that makes this worth $3,500 for me?\n\n- And you raise a good point, especially when you talk about the developer relations, some of the apps that aren't going to be on it, and then you couple that with the price tag and that what am I even going to use this for factor. How do you think Apple gets this beyond the early adopters to have your everyday person really be interested in this product?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I think what it comes down to is the usefulness of it. When the initial reviews start coming out and people giving their own input on what it's like to own them, that, I think, is when we're really going to start to see how Apple pushes this forward.\n\nDon't forget, when the Apple Watch came out, it didn't get great reviews. They were decent. People were like, well, why do I need this watch? It's expensive. Fast forward to now and it's the best selling smartwatch in the world.\n\nSo, I mean, same thing with the AirPods. People were making fun of them when they first came out. And if you walk around anywhere, people have AirPods in all over the place. There's knock-offs that try to look like the AirPods because the AirPods are so popular.\n\nSo it's not that this isn't a product that has potential, I think right now, people are still trying to figure out what they're going to use it for, what they need it for, just like we saw with those others. With the Apple Watch and the AirPods. Those have more of a right-up-in-your-face, this is why I want to use it. But it took a while for the Apple Watch to really kind of get honed in on the health side of things.\n\nI think that might be what we see with the Vision Pro. Where it kind of comes out, there's this general idea of what it may be used for, and then it really gets honed in and people start saying, well, I want to buy it.\n\nI think the price tag is still a little rich for a lot of folks. They'll have to release a lower priced option. Or maybe they will lower the price overall. But, I think, right now, it's still very much a kind of wait and see for where we go with this.\n\n- Yeah. As one of our guests said, Apple Vision Pro suggests there may be a cheaper alternative coming. But as you've noted Dan, always a challenge with first generation of products. But we'll be watching to see how that demand picks up. Thanks so much.",

        "content": "Bill Gates, currently the eighth richest man in the world with a net worth of over $121 billion, made his fortune from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). Since stepping down as CEO of Microsoft, Gates has invested across several assets to multiply his wealth.\n\nGates's investment portfolio currently holds 75 stocks and is valued at $38.91 billion as of Nov. 14. Several renowned billionaires have also invested in the stocks Gates holds, reflecting the resilience of respective large-cap companies amid the volatile market backdrop.\n\nWhile each billionaire investor has a unique approach, the majority of them have a substantial stake in the biggest tech stocks in the market. These technology giants who have dominated the market have withstood the test of time. As the macroeconomic headwinds, including economic slowdown concerns and uncertainty regarding the rate cut timeline persist, following billionaires' cues might be beneficial.\n\nTake a close look at a handful of blue chip stocks that not only appeal to Gates but also capture the attention of fellow billionaires.\n\nMicrosoft Corp.\n\nGates owns 1.38% of the total outstanding shares of Microsoft. The Magnificent Seven stock dominated the tech space last year, with its strategic investments in OpenAI and the acquisition of Activision Blizzard attracting investors. Shares of Microsoft have risen by over 6% year to date, outperforming the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index's 2% gains so far this year.\n\nThe company's growth potential has attracted several other billionaires as well. Billionaire portfolio manager Ken Fisher bought over 560,000 shares of Microsoft in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, bringing his total holdings to approximately 24.9 million shares. Microsoft is the second-largest holding in Fisher's portfolio. Fisher's Fisher Asset Management has over $236 billion in assets under management.\n\nSteven Cohen, founder and CEO of hedge fund company Point72 Asset Management, also bought over 203,000 shares of Microsoft in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Cohen owns 2.03 million shares of Microsoft, accounting for 2.18% of his total portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nCitadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin also bought nearly 1.63 million shares of Microsoft in the third quarter, increasing his stake in the tech behemoth by 47.9%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nApple Inc.\n\nGates bought approximately 52,815 shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the third quarter. The Microsoft co-founder joined the Apple bandwagon relatively late, as many billionaires already have significant exposure to the tech giant. Warren Buffett, one of the most influential investors of this generation, considers Apple to be one of his crown jewels, claiming the business is \"better than anything we own.\"\n\nBuffett has a 5.9% stake in Apple as he owns over 915 million shares, making it his largest portfolio holding. He last bought Apple shares in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFisher increased his stake in Apple in the third quarter, scooping up over 878,000 shares. Apple is the largest holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 5.25% of its total portfolio.\n\nConcerns regarding slowing demand for Apple's products have caused the stock to plummet this year. Given concerns regarding Apple's sales in China amid tensions between the U.S. and China, the tech giant has been strategically shifting its production base to India. The company aims to produce nearly 25% of its iPhones in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nBank of America upgraded Apple stock to Buy on Jan. 18, issuing a price target of $225.

        "content": "In this article, we will explore Ken Griffin's Wellington Fund delivers mind-numbing returns and its top 15 stocks. If you prefer skipping our introduction to Ken Griffin and his hedge fund, take a look at Ken Griffin's Wellington Fund Delivers Mind-Numbing Returns and Its Top 5 Stocks.\n\nCitadel Investment Group, which Ken Griffin founded in 1990 with an initial capital of $4.2 million, has grown to be one of the most significant hedge funds in the world. The hedge fund started 2024 with $58 billion in assets under management. That makes it one of the world’s top 10 hedge funds by assets.\n\nCitadel Investment Group's success has made Ken Griffin one of the world's top billionaires, with a fortune of more than $36 billion. The hedge fund operates several portfolio funds, with Wellington being its main portfolio. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, Citadel Investment Group’s combined portfolio value across its various funds stood above $466.5 billion.\n\nThe hedge fund applies the multi-strategy investing method, where it makes both long and short bets. As a result, its portfolio value consists of shareholding positions in a diverse range of companies, value of its options positions and other investments. In stocks, technology represents billionaire Ken Griffin’s biggest bet.\n\nFor the global financial markets, 2023 was a tumultuous year. It was marked by rapidly rising Fed interest rates, which rattled markets and led to widespread debt defaults and bankruptcies.\n\nBut for Ken Griffin’s flagship Wellington fund, 2023 was another exceptional year in terms of investment returns. In a year that most hedge funds struggled to make money for their clients, Wellington delivered solid returns of 15.3%, crushing the hedge fund industry average of 4.4%.\n\nThe Citadel Investment Group’s fund generated a profit of $7 billion in 2023, all of which it plans to distribute to its clients this year. The fund returned a similar amount to investors the previous year after its 2022 profit jumped 38% to a record $16 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Wellington fund has a long history of delivering double-digit returns that strongly outpace the hedge fund industry average. In 2021, its returns topped 26%, which improved from returns of 24% in 2020.

In the U.S., a presidential election year like this one could bring many uncertainties to the markets.\n\nAmid all this, Ken Griffin has predicted that a recession could hit the U.S. economy in the second quarter of 2024. While recession concerns remain, the stock market could benefit from the prospects of the Fed starting to trim interest rates to avoid an economic downturn.

T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS)\n\nCitadel Investment Group’s Equity Stake: $562.94 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nBellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) is a communication services company that provides mobile communication services.

The stock also offers an opportunity to generate passive income through a yield of 0.40%. Citadel Investment Group held stakes worth $562.94 million in T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) as of Q3.\n\nInsider Monkey looked at 910 hedge fund holdings for their third quarter of 2023 investments and discovered that 79 had bought the firm's shares. T-Mobile Us Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) 's largest hedge fund investor back then was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group, which owned shares worth $562.94 million.\n\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter we initiated positions in two new names: T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Gilead Sciences. T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.\n\nThis combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.\n\nGiven the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.\n\nWe have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend. The company announced its inaugural dividend in September, and we bought the stock shortly thereafter. The initial yield is about 2% and it is expected to grow about 10% per year.”\n\n13.

We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.\"\n\n9.

The strength in the Company’s services segment was aided by over 1 billion paid subscribers across Apple’s media platforms.

(NYSE:JPM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Last spring, the US went through a brief banking crisis that cost several smaller and medium-sized banks their lives. One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations. That is why we hold JPM.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Ken Griffin's Wellington Fund Delivers Mind-Numbing Returns and Its Top 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nBest Bail Bond Companies in Each of the 30 Biggest Cities in the US 20 Large US Cities with the Fewest Homes for Sale Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 30\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Tech giant Apple Inc. has entered the virtual reality (VR) competition with the recent announcement of its new product Vision Pro. Set to be available for preorders in February, the unveiling of this cutting-edge device marks a significant milestone for Apple.\n\nApple experienced a remarkable 45% stock price rise last year, but shares are about flat to start 2024, fortunate to even bounce back after two prominent analyst downgrades. Coming off a 2.8% year-over-year decline in revenue in 2023, Apple will need to sell and execute its future.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHere is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden. This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?\n\nManagement is betting big on VR to get it there. Apple CEO Tim Cook has long been known as an operational genius, not a product genius, which makes this technological innovation potentially legacy-defining.\n\nWith this new hot product, the spotlight is now on Apple, and the question looms whether Vision Pro can give a boost to its sales to justify its roughly 30 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nThe Vision Pro, priced at $3,499, is positioning itself as a high-end competitor in the market. This places it at seven times the cost of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset priced at $500.\n\nThe significant price difference raises questions about the features and capabilities that justify Vision Pro’s premium positioning compared to Meta’s offering. Price was called out by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg, who reportedly said Apple's vision is \"not the one [he] wants.\"\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), a key and established player in the VR space, introduced its first virtual-reality headset, the Oculus Quest, in 2019. Its latest release, the Quest 3, hit the market in October, further intensifying competition in the VR sector.\n\nTrending: How to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024? These investors have the latest tips.\n\nMETA saw significant success in 2023, with a remarkable 128% increase in share price. It continues to hold strong in the early days of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut several industry giants have competing views on what the metaverse is and should be. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., which owns the rights to the popular book and movie \"Ready Player One,\" recently announced a new VR venture. Ready Player One is set in a dystopian future where humanity has largely lost hope in the real world. As such, people have retreated to the OASIS, a metaverse so integral the virtual currency is more valuable than the real deal.\n\nDespite the book outlining a bleak and dystopian future, Warner Bros. has begun development of a Ready Player One-based metaverse. Oddly, this venture is at the approval and direction of the author of the \"Ready Player One\" series Ernest Cline.\n\nThe move comes as companies continue to integrate virtual and augmented reality features into their existing business plans. Amazon.com Inc. recently launched augmented reality shopping, The Walt Disney Co. launched a virtual reality division, and Meta continues to pioneer within the space.\n\nMetaverse startups saw roughly $500 million raised from venture capital in 2023. While this is a far cry from larger funding areas like AI, it still represents a shift in investments. As larger players continue to make investments and build products in the space, it will likely play a larger role in everyday life. Someday, people might even be able to experience Ready Player One virtual reality and actual reality.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDiscover why high-profile names like Leonard Dicaprio are turning to diamond assets and how you can get involved with just $100.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Apple (AAPL) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Apple (AAPL).\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AAPL Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AAPL\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Apple, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market investment trends, and go directly to read 5 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nOn Friday, January 19, the S&P 500 achieved a historic milestone by closing at an all-time high, as investors enthusiastically reentered the equity market after a brief stumble at the beginning of 2024. The broad market index recorded a 1.23% increase, settling at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior intraday and closing highs set in January 2022. Simultaneously, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had established its own record at the close of the previous year, surged by 395.19 points or 1.05%, concluding at 37,863.80. The Nasdaq Composite saw a 1.70% uptick, reaching 15,310.97, while the more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.95%, also attaining a new record high. Notably, all three major averages are now in positive territory for the year 2024, with the 30-stock Dow turning green during Friday's robust rally.\n\nIn addition, traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve will delay easing its policy until May, marking the conclusion of a week characterized by robust economic data and statements from central bankers that eroded confidence in the possibility of earlier interest-rate cuts. On January 19, a key gauge of consumer sentiment reached its highest level in 2-1/2 years, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated that the U.S. central bank would refrain from committing to rate cuts until there is greater certainty regarding inflation aligning with a healthy 2%. Futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate declined, indicating approximately a 47% chance of a rate cut by March, down from 55% earlier in the day. Just a week ago, the likelihood of an interest-rate cut in March stood at nearly 80%, reflecting a swifter-than-anticipated decline in inflation.\n\nIn such an economic environment, it makes sense for investors to turn to stocks that are both lucrative and affordable to navigate such macroeconomic conditions. While these stocks may not always offer the same level of security as mega-cap firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), they present an opportunity for decent short-term returns due to their volatility. Some of the best affordable stocks in this context include Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), among others listed below.\n\nStory continues 15 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA close-up of an investor pointing to a chart featured on a projector, conveying a message of growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best affordable stocks to buy, we used stock screeners to shortlist stocks that were trading at a share price of less than $50.

        "title": "A British inventor chasing Apple for $18 billion over alleged iTunes theft says the case has left him in a ‘deep depression’",
        "content": "If you were to ask Apple, eighth-grade dropout Patrick Racz is just a \"Patent Troll\" with no inventions but an axe to grind. But having already chased the tech giant for $530 million, Racz has his sights on a much bigger prize, provided he can prove Apple stole its legendary iTunes idea from the inventor.\n\nRacz is locked in the middle of an $18 billion lawsuit against Apple, accusing the group of stealing his patent for the storage of music and videos through a software solution.\n\nThe inventor filed another lawsuit with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in October to force the group to disclose documents related to his case against Apple, indicating he has no intention of pulling back any time soon.\n\n'A deep depression'\n\nPrivate investors back Racz in his drawn-out and expensive pursuit of Apple for damages.\n\n“The technology I invented allowed Apple to become the biggest company in the world, and I still haven’t earned a penny,” Racz told the Times of London last year. “After 21 years of fighting for justice, the time has come for me and my long-suffering investors to finally get paid.“\n\nBut in an interview with the Guardian, Racz has detailed how a lengthy legal fight with Apple has left him ostracized from the tech community and with few friends in the industry as he finds himself labeled a patent troll from most corners.\n\nHe has also faced death threats.\n\n“Those things start to sting – when you’re told that your kids should be burned at the stake and that you should be beheaded for what you’re doing,\" Racz told the Guardian. He now says the fight with Apple has become his legacy.\n\n'Tap man' turns on Apple\n\nRacz made his fortune from a three-prong mixer tap that would distill hot, cold, and filtered water to its owners. After selling Avilion, the company behind the tap, Racz turned his eye toward music software.\n\nAfter setting up Smartflash in 2000, Racz obtained patents on systems that would store media including songs and videos. He says he discussed the idea with a technologist who would go on to become a senior director at Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe also discussed it with Gemplus, a company that later partnered with Apple and used the product, he claims in his lawsuit.\n\n“From that point on, virtually every product they launch incorporated my technology in some way, shape or form,” Racz said of the launch of iTunes in 2003, the Times of London reports.\n\n“I went through a period of deep depression,” Racz told the Guardian of seeing his attempts at a second fortune wiped out in the dotcom boom while Apple launched its iTunes platform.\n\n“I’m ashamed to say I hit the bottle. I was totally lost in a haze of time and I couldn’t remember a lot.”\n\nRacz filed for a patent soon after he created the software but didn’t obtain it until 2008, setting off his legal challenge against the $2.96 trillion company.\n\nHe has had minor successes during his long, tumultuous patent fight with Apple, but nothing long-lasting.\n\nBack in 2015, a judge ordered Apple to pay $532.9 million to Smartflash LLC for willful infringement of three U.S. patents.\n\nAs soon as he won that verdict, Racz and Smartflash pursued the company and other tech groups, including Google and Amazon, for four more patent infringements.\n\nTwo years later, though, Racz saw the decision quashed by an appeals court, which argued Smartflash’s patents were invalid. He failed in his own appeal attempts, leading to the latest rampage against the group.\n\nA representative for Apple didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nHowever, a representative recirculated a past comment it published in 2015 with the Guardian.\n\n\"Smartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no US presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented,\" the representative said.\n\n\"We refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "These 5 Wildly Popular High-Flying Stocks of 2023 Could Be Duds in the Rest of 2024, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Over the long term, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return in the ballpark of 10%. When a given stock generates a return below that level it can be disappointing. That's especially the case for growth stocks for which investors have great expectations.\n\nSuch growth stocks led the charge last year, helping the major market indexes achieve big gains. Many analysts don't think you should look for a similar performance in the new year from all of them, though. These five wildly popular high-flying stocks of 2023 could be duds in the rest of 2024, according to Wall Street.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nThanks to a 57% return in 2023, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ended the year just a hair away from becoming the most valuable company in the world based on market cap. The tech stock's modest rise in recent weeks has allowed it to claim the title, albeit just barely.\n\nHowever, Wall Street doesn't expect much more from Microsoft. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of less than 6%. The most pessimistic analyst thinks that Microsoft's share price could fall nearly 22%.\n\nValuation is one key concern. Microsoft's shares trade at a sky-high forward earnings multiple of 34.8.\n\n2. Apple\n\nYou can probably guess which company Microsoft knocked out of the No. 1 spot. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) reigned as the largest company in the world for several years. But the stock's 48% gain in 2023 wasn't enough to keep it on top after losing ground a little this month.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to continue to go neck-and-neck with Microsoft in the battle of market caps. The average 12-month price target for the stock is also less than 6% above its current price.\n\nThe main knock against Apple is its lack of growth. In its last reported quarter, the company's revenue slipped 1% year over year. Even with services revenue reaching an all-time high, Apple simply isn't delivering the growth that it has in the past.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that sizzled last year. Its shares skyrocketed 58% thanks in large part to the flurry of interest in generative AI.\n\nWall Street doesn't expect Alphabet's sizzle to completely fizzle in 2024. However, the consensus forecast is decidedly less enthusiastic than investors would like. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of just over 7%.\n\nSome investors could still be concerned about Google Cloud after Alphabet reported slowing growth for the unit in the third quarter of 2023. Others could worry that the U.S. economy won't have the soft landing that many economists predict, which could dampen Alphabet's advertising revenue growth.\n\n4. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) wowed investors in 2023 with its share price more than doubling. The company ramped up production of its electric vehicles and launched its Cybertruck.\n\nBut Wall Street doesn't predict nearly as big of a wow from Tesla this year. The average price target for the stock is nearly 8% above the current price. That's not bad, but it's a lot lower than investors would prefer. One especially bearish analyst even thinks that Tesla stock could plunge almost 90%.\n\nMost of the analyst ratings came before Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) that he wants to gain around 25% voting control of the company. Whether or not Musk achieves his goal -- and what it might mean for the stock -- remains to be seen.\n\n5. Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) is something of an outlier in this group. It isn't part of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The company doesn't have a clear connection with AI. However, Lilly was without question a wildly popular stock last year with its shares jumping 59%.\n\nAnalysts aren't looking for a wild performance from Lilly in 2024, though. The average 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of barely over 2%.\n\nAs was the case with Microsoft, valuation appears to be the primary issue for Wall Street with Lilly. The pharma stock's forward earnings multiple tops 51. That's a nosebleed level.\n\nIs Wall Street right about these stocks?\n\nI don't know if these five stocks will beat analysts' price targets or not. Wall Street could be right about the stocks' near-term prospects. However, it doesn't matter, in my opinion. What's important are the long-term prospects for each company.\n\nMy view is that AI will provide a strong tailwind for Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla over the next decade and beyond. I think that the opportunities for Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro, weight-loss drug Zepbound, and Alzheimer's disease drug donanemab (which awaits an approval decision) put its valuation in a much more favorable light.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me one bit if analysts revise their price targets upward for several, if not all, of these stocks in the coming months. Whether they do or not, I predict that all five will remain wildly popular in 2024 and for years to come -- for good reasons.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "For almost 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been outpacing Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).\n\nAs of the closing bell on Jan. 12, 2023, Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) had gained an aggregate of 4,458,849% since the Oracle of Omaha became CEO. Further, Buffett has overseen an annualized return that practically doubles up the annualized total return, including dividends paid, of the benchmark S&P 500 since the mid-1960s. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA 13F isn't a buy or sell recommendation from Wall Street's most-successful investors\n\nWarren Buffett's overwhelming success means he has a veritable army of professional and everyday investors who wait on the edge of their seats to discover what he's been buying and selling.\n\nMoney managers and investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors bought and sold in the most recent quarter.\n\nAlthough buying and selling activity shown within a 13F shouldn't be construed as a buy or sell recommendation from institutional money managers, investors may use the historic trading activity of Wall Street's top minds (like Buffett) as a reason to enter or exit a position.\n\nAs an example, Warren Buffett and his top investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have built a gargantuan position in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since the first quarter of 2016. Through Jan. 12, Apple accounted for 47% of Berkshire Hathaway's $361 billion investment portfolio, and it's been a company that the Oracle of Omaha and his team have added to with some frequency over the past eight years.\n\nBut even though Buffett has sung Apple's praises for its more than $600 billion worth of buybacks, and referred to his company's top investment holding as \"a better business than any we own\" during Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 annual shareholder meeting, he's never advocated that investors buy Apple stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett is also a huge fan of financial stocks that benefit from the long-term expansion of the U.S. economy. Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) is the type of business that should be able to grow its loan portfolio over time and enjoy incremental increases in net interest income as lending rates normalize from historic lows. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks.\n\nHowever, Warren Buffett has never suggested that investors purchase shares of his company's second-largest holding (BofA).\n\nDespite strongly advocating that investors not bet against America, Buffett doesn't make specific investment suggestions -- with one exception. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThese are the only two current Berkshire holdings that Buffett has suggested investors buy\n\nWhen the page turned to 2024, Berkshire Hathaway had stakes in 51 securities. None of the 49 stocks in Berkshire's portfolio have been suggested as buys from the Oracle of Omaha. However, the two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Berkshire holds stakes in -- the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) -- are buy suggestions made by Warren Buffett for everyday investors.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick in 2017, Buffett had this to say when questioned about where investors should put their money to work:\n\nI think it's the same thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time, and that is to consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund. Keep buying it through thick and thin -- and especially through thin. The temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, 'Well, maybe I should skip a year,' or something. Just keep buying. American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha is well aware that downturns in the U.S. economy and stock market are inevitable. But he astutely recognizes that economic weakness and stock market corrections have a tendency to be short-lived. That's why he believes the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust make for surefire buys.\n\nSince the end of World War II, the U.S. economy has navigated its way through a dozen recessions. Nine of these 12 downturns ended in less than a year, with the remaining three failing to surpass 18 months. By comparison, most periods of economic expansion have lasted multiple years, with two expansions cresting the decade mark since 1945.\n\nIt's official. A new bull market is confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 is now up 20% from its 10/12/22 closing low. The prior bear market saw the index fall 25.4% over 282 days.\r\n\r\nRead more at https://t.co/H4p1RcpfIn. pic.twitter.com/tnRz1wdonp\n\n-- Bespoke (@bespokeinvest) June 8, 2023\n\nIt's the same story for equities on Wall Street. A dataset released in June by researchers at Bespoke Investment Group showed that the average S&P 500 bear market dating back to the start of the Great Recession in September 1929 lasted just 286 calendar days, or roughly 9.5 months. That compares to the typical bull market for the S&P 500 over the past 94 years of 1,011 calendar days, or approximately two years and nine months.\n\nBest of all, time is an undefeated ally of investors when it comes to the benchmark S&P 500. Every year, the analysts at Crestmont Research update an extensive dataset that examines the rolling 20-year total returns of the S&P 500. Though the S&P didn't exist until 1923, its components could be found in other major indexes dating back to the start of the 20th century. This allowed the researchers at Crestmont to back-test their total returns data to 1900 and examine 105 separate rolling 20-year periods (1919-2023).\n\nThe key takeaway of Crestmont's dataset is that there hasn't been a rolling 20-year period that would have resulted in an investor losing money dating back more than a century. Whereas you can count on one hand how many rolling 20-year periods ended with an annualized total return of 3% to 5%, more than 50 of the 105 ending years produced annualized total returns ranging from 9% to 17.1%. History shows that if you hold an S&P 500 tracking index for 20 years, you'll generate a profit every time.\n\nAlthough both of the S&P 500 index funds Berkshire owns very closely mirror the performance of the S&P 500, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has a slight edge over the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust in the cost department. The former sports a net expense ratio of just 0.03% (a $0.30 fee for every $1,000 invested), while the latter has a net expense ratio of 0.09% (a $0.90 fee for every $1,000 invested). While both are ultralow, all things considered, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is going to allow investors to hang onto more of their principal and investment gains over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Here are the Views of Polen Focus Growth Strategy on Apple (AAPL)",
        "content": "Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its “Polen Focus Growth Strategy” fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the quarter the fund returned 14.43% (net) compared to 14.16% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 11.69% for the S&P 500 Index. For the full year, the fund returned 38.99% (net) compared to 42.68% and 26.29% returns for the indexes. The firm had the second-highest return in the Portfolio's 35-year history in 2023.  In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy featured stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational technology company that designs and manufactures smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. On January 19, 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $191.56 per share. One-month return of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was -1.05%, and its shares gained 38.94% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a market capitalization of $2.962 trillion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. While on a total attribution basis, Apple was not a top three detractor to our full-year return, given its extremely large weighting in the Index, we feel it’s worth sharing our thoughts.\n\nThe company’s share price appreciated nearly 50% in a year when its revenue declined and earnings per share was relatively flat with the previous year.\n\nFor 2024, consensus expectations are for low-single-digit revenue growth and only slightly faster EPS growth. These pedestrian growth rates are not surprising for a company with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue. What is more surprising is that Apple shares trade at nearly 30x forward earnings, a large premium to the market and many faster-growing, competitively advantaged businesses.\n\nWhile we continue to think Apple is a wonderful business, it is also a slow growing one with risks that we do not see as insignificant. Apple’s entire supply chain is based in China and much of its incremental revenue growth also comes from China, so if there is a U.S.-China issue that makes it more difficult for U.S.-based companies that have access to large amounts of local data to operate in China, Apple’s business would likely face more challenges than many others. In addition, much of Apple’s services growth and margin expansion has come from direct payments from Google to be the default search provider on iOS devices. This practice is currently the subject of a lawsuit between Google and the U.S. Justice Department. If this practice is deemed unlawful, it could take away a large and highly profitable revenue stream from Apple’s already slow growth engine. While we closely cover Apple, we continue to believe we have better investment opportunities. Apple’s current P/E is above our Portfolio’s weighted average, yet its long-term earnings growth rate is likely to be lower than even our slowest growing holding, according to our research.\"\n\nStory continues Apple TV, AAPL TV, Apple's TV\n\nApple Inc.

        "title": "4 Things You Need to Know Before You Rush to Buy Apple Stock in 2024",
        "content": "Everyone is familiar with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). As one of the best-known brands in the world, the business sells some of the most in-demand hardware products that consumers pay premium prices to own.\n\nApple shares have made for a fantastic investment over the years, climbing 817% in the last decade. And more recently, they rose 48% in 2023, beating the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nBut before you rush to buy this FAANG stock in 2024, here are four things you need to know.\n\n1. The importance of the iPhone\n\nAlthough the company sells a variety of hardware products, like the Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, and iPad, Apple is still incredibly dependent upon the iPhone. In the last fiscal year (ended Sept. 30), the business generated 52% of its revenue from the flagship smartphone.\n\nFrom a profitability perspective, this is a good thing. The iPhone only represents about 20% of global smartphone shipments, but due to its pricing power, it accounts for roughly 80% of the industry's operating income. This helps explain why Apple is such a profitable enterprise.\n\nHowever, the iPhone is in a mature stage in its life cycle. With new upgrades having fewer game-changing features, it's easier for consumers to choose not to update their phones every year, instead holding on to their existing ones for longer.\n\n2. Growing services\n\nWhat makes Apple a truly great business is not just its hardware products, but the entire ecosystem. And a key aspect of this is the company's growing services segment. This division includes things like Apple Pay, iCloud, News, Music, and TV+.\n\nServices have been expanding at a faster rate than products in recent times. In fiscal 2023, services saw revenue increase by 9%, representing 22% of the overall company's sales. As more of Apple's revenue comes from services, it can be a boon for profitability, as this division carries a stellar gross margin of 71%.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Apple's services drive customer loyalty and stickiness. They give consumers less reason to leave for offerings from competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Aggressive share repurchaser\n\nI've mentioned how profitable Apple is. In the past 10 years, the company's operating margin has averaged a superb 27.9%. This isn't what you're used to seeing from a typical consumer electronics business. It points to Apple's strong brand and differentiation.\n\nAdditionally, Apple generates copious amounts of free cash flow (FCF). In just the last three fiscal years, FCF totaled a whopping $304 billion. Remember, this is the money left over after the business reinvests in growth opportunities. And it affords Apple financial flexibility that other companies can only dream about.\n\nManagement has used this FCF to aggressively buy back stock. Last fiscal year, nearly $78 billion went toward repurchasing shares. And in the last five years, the company's outstanding share count has been reduced by 21%.\n\n4. Expensive valuation\n\nWhile it's difficult to find reasons not to like Apple's business, there's one important reason that investors should hesitate before buying the stock: valuation.\n\nAs of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.8. This is significantly more expensive than Apple's trailing-10-year average of 20.8. And it represents a huge premium to the S&P 500.\n\nIt's challenging to be optimistic about Apple generating market-beating returns going forward when the valuation is so high. This is especially true given how mature the company is these days, with more muted growth prospects than it had in past years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Investors to Follow on Twitter and Social Media.\n\nMorgan Stanley Bullish on Diversified, Alpha Hedge Fund Portfolios\n\nOn December 31, 2023, Morgan Stanley reported that falling inflation levels are expected to be sluggishly above bank targets ahead of 2024. Such may lead to price dispersion and provide hedge fund alpha opportunities across asset classes. Throughout 2024, the Fed is expected to ease monetary policy which may eventually push wide discrepancies among winners and losers. While an easing cycle coupled with higher interest rates may increase volatility in bond prices, hedge funds may be able to benefit from higher interest rates, especially with derivative-based investing strategies. Morgan Stanley is bullish on diversified and alpha hedge fund portfolios in the current environment. The market is uncertain and the outlook for 2024 seems unclear, which may be a hint towards avoiding big and risky bets.\n\nTop Stock Picks of Hedge Funds\n\nInstitutional investors are heavily positioned in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Let's take a look at these stocks in detail. You can also take a look at some of the most promising stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was a part of 306 hedge fund portfolios at the close of the third quarter of 2023. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $72.19 billion, up from $69.79 billion in the previous quarter with 300 positions. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive.\n\nOn November 28, 2023, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. The dividend is payable on March 14 to shareholders of record on February 15. As of January 18, the stock has a forward dividend yield of 0.76% and a 5-year dividend growth rate of 10.16%. The company has been growing its dividends consistently for 19 years and has a payout ratio of 26.70%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds are bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The stock was a part of 180 hedge fund portfolios at the close of the third quarter of 2023. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $29.58 billion, up from $25.97 billion in the previous quarter with 175 positions.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also on analysts' radars.

To commence with our research we first established certain parameters to define a niche for our list. Therefore, our list consists of popular hedge fund managers that primarily own a Twitter account, and other social media channels if available. We first consulted four reports on the internet including Forbes, Benzinga, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance. We then applied certain filters on LinkedIn using keywords such as \"hedge fund manager\" to ensure we did not miss any important names. Finally, we also looked up founding members and owners of popular hedge funds. This thorough process enabled us to come up with 55 hedge fund managers. We then conducted a manual search to find the Twitter account of every investor along with other social media such as LinkedIn and Instagram, if available. Moreover, we consulted Forbes to extract profiles and the net worth of each investor.\n\nIt is to be noted that while we intended to include hedge fund managers with a significant social media presence, some of the most popular names in the hedge fund industry do not own Twitter accounts. For such investors, we have ranked them earlier in the list based on their social media presence on any other social media site such as Linkedin, Instagram, or YouTube. The list of the 30 best investors to follow on Twitter and social media is in ascending order of Twitter followers as of January 18, 2024.\n\n30 Best Investors to Follow on Twitter and Social Media\n\n30.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Bets on the US stock market rally broadening out beyond a handful of tech behemoths this year are bumping into a familiar reality: Those same megacaps remain Corporate America’s most likely source of profit growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHedge Funds Rake in Huge Profits Betting on Catastrophe Risk Putin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union Trump’s 2016 Win Shook Markets. Traders Won’t Get Fooled Again. Burger King Is Serving Whoppers With a Side of Cringe The Easy Money Has Already Been Made in Bonds\n\nTech’s fourth quarter earnings season kicks off this week with results from Netflix Inc., Tesla Inc. and Intel Corp. The so-called Magnificent Seven are expected to deliver combined profit growth of about 46%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s down slightly from the third quarter’s 53% expansion, but it still dwarfs almost all of the main sectors in the S&P 500 Index.\n\nConsidering how important these companies are to the overall stock market — they accounted for virtually all of last year’s 24% advance and drove the S&P 500 to an all-time high on Friday — earnings season doesn’t quite get going until they show up with their results.\n\n“The dominant growth in the market is coming from Big Tech,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “If they disappoint, that’s a real risk to the overall market.”\n\nBulls are banking on strong earnings reports to rekindle a rally in the S&P 500 Index that has slowed a bit to start the year after 2023’s torid pace. Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Nvidia Corp., Tesla and Meta Platforms Inc. accounted for about two-thirds of that gain.\n\nApple, one of the pillars of last year’s rally after adding nearly $1 trillion in market value, has limped out of the gate in 2024 amid concerns about its growth prospects. Its most innovative product in years, the $3,499 Vision Pro headset, is set to begin shipping next month but is unlikely to provide a jolt to sales any time soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has pushed deeper into record territory on rising expectations that its expanding lineup of AI-infused software products will fuel bigger profits. The Redmond, Washington-based company said on Jan. 15 it will charge $20 a month for a consumer version of its AI assistant.\n\nChanging Leadership\n\nLooking at the stock market as a whole, the S&P 500 has had a bumpy ride to start the year, falling in early January before rising to a new record on Friday. Investors are trying to assess the strength of the US economy and determine when the Federal Reserve will start cutting its benchmark interest rate, which is sitting at the highest since the dot-com era.\n\nThe S&P 500’s leadership has changed in recent weeks, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc., Eli Lilly & Co. and Merck & Co. among the most prominent point gainers so far in 2024. Meanwhile Tesla, which is down more than 15% since New Year’s, has become the heaviest drag on the S&P, with Apple close behind.\n\nFor tech investors, one big question is how much the AI craze will contribute to earnings and then spill over into stock prices. Nvidia, which is the best stock in the S&P 500 this year and last, dominates the market for chips used in AI computing and is expected to post fourth-quarter profits of more than $10 billion, up from $1.4 billion a year ago.\n\nWithout Nvidia, the S&P 500 Information Technology Index’s projected fourth quarter profit growth would be more than cut in half, according to Wendy Soong, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“We think more companies are likely to find ways to monetize their AI exposure, and investors will be looking for evidence on how companies can maintain or improve their margins,” Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a research note on Jan. 17. “We are only in the first innings of the AI story.”\n\nCrowding Concerns\n\nAt the same time, signs of crowded positioning in tech are raising concerns about the risk of a sell off if results from some of the giants disappoint. A global fund manager survey from Bank of America Corp. this month showed the most common trade is being long Big Tech and other tech growth stocks.\n\nTo Matt Maley of Miller Tabak + Co., recent trading has shown that Big Tech is driving the market again and the heavy concentration is a “warning flag” for investors that may come back to bite them.\n\n“When the fast-money hedge funds have such large concentrated positions, it leaves the market very vulnerable to a short-term shock,” said Maley, the firm’s chief market strategist.\n\nDespite this set up, the options market is pricing in “virtually no risk” for megacap stocks, according to Brian Donlin, head of equity derivatives strategy at Stifel Nicolaus.\n\nAmeriprise Financial’s Saglimbene is confident that any selloff would be relatively short lived as the attraction of Big Tech stocks are unlikely to dim.\n\n“Over the long term, investors will look to these companies and gravitate back to them because they really do have the growth, the recurring revenue and the potential for greater growth in the future,” he said. “No other sector offers that kind of runway for earnings.”\n\n—With assistance from Carly Wanna, Isabelle Lee and Ryan Vlastelica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "The retail industry is vast, with the U.S. market soaring from a value of $3 trillion in 2000 to over $7 trillion in 2022. The rise of online shopping and digital forms of payment has expanded the industry and given companies new avenues for boosting earnings.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) operate in significantly different areas of retail, with one focused on consumer electronics and the other on wholesale grocery. However, both of these companies have delivered triple-digit stock growth over the last five years and have built up immense consumer loyalty.\n\nApple and Costco have some exciting developments in the works for the new year, making now an excellent time to consider an investment in their stocks. So let's examine whether you're better off with Apple or Costco stock in 2024.\n\nApple\n\nDespite offering a considerably smaller range of products than most retailers, Apple ranks 11th out of the top 100 leading U.S. retailers, according to Statista.\n\nThe popularity of devices like the iPhone, the MacBook, AirPods, and the iPad is unmatched. Meanwhile, an easy-to-use design language and interconnected system between all of Apple's products encourage consumers to stick with the company for the long haul.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the tech giant posted a revenue dip of 3% year over year. Macroeconomic declines caught up with Apple as marketwide headwinds led to reductions in consumer spending. However, recent data suggests the tech market might finally be in recovery.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 saw smartphone shipments increase 4% year over year after almost two years of declines. PC shipments similarly returned to growth in the quarter, rising 0.3%. Market improvements have yet to be reflected in Apple's earnings, but it's a promising sign for 2024.\n\nApple generated nearly $100 billion in free cash flow despite market challenges last year. Alongside a booming digital services business and expansions in AI, I wouldn't bet against the company's long-term future. It has the brand power and cash reserves to come back strong and flourish over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco\n\nCostco ranks third on the list of 100 biggest U.S. retailers. Meanwhile, as seen in the chart below, it has delivered significantly more stock growth over the last five years than some of its biggest American rivals. COST Chart\n\nThe company has won over consumers worldwide with its unique business model of charging an annual subscription fee for access to market-low prices in a wholesale setting. Product sales don't actually amount to much in profit. However, the company has rectified that with its membership-based business model.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Costco hit more than $6 billion in profits, with membership fees making up 73% of that figure. Alongside a 90% subscription renewal rate, the company is crushing it in retail.\n\nMoreover, the company has managed to keep investors happy with consistent growth and surprise dividends that are substantially bigger than its usual dividend yield of 0.61%. On Jan. 12, the company paid out a dividend of $15 per share, with its last special dividend released in 2020 for $10 per share.\n\nA winning business model and happy investors make Costco's stock seem like a no-brainer for anyone looking to invest in retail.\n\nIs Apple or Costco the better stock to buy in 2024?\n\nApple and Costco dominate their respective markets, each profiting from some of the most loyal userbases in retail. However, just because a company leads an industry doesn't necessarily mean it's trading at the right price.\n\nThe following data suggests Apple's stock currently offers far more value than Costco. COST PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart compares Apple and Costco's price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) and price-to-free cash flows (P/FCF). For both valuation metrics, Apple's lower figures indicate its stock is the cheaper option.\n\nP/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/FCF divides its market cap by free cash flow. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the more value a stock offers.\n\nThese metrics are helpful in determining a stock's value as they take into account a company's financial health. Apple wins on both fronts, with its share price a bargain compared to Costco's. Along with an improving tech market and expansions into high-growth sectors like AI, the company is the better stock in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Set to Make $2 Billion in Dividend Income in 2024 From Just 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has made fortunes for early investors in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) who held on to the stock for the long term. The stock returned 3,787,464% from 1965 through 2022. That's more than 150 times the 24,708% return from the S&P 500 index over the same period.\n\nContributing to those returns was the growing value of Berkshire's stock holdings -- a portfolio worth $318 billion at the end of 2023's third quarter. One common theme among its largest stock holdings is that those stocks own strong brands and pay regular dividends.\n\nBuffett acknowledged in last year's shareholder letter that stakes in Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and American Express(NYSE: AXP), which Berkshire Hathaway has held for decades, have provided it with billions of dollars in unrealized gains from share price appreciation that was partially powered by their growing dividends.\n\nThese two stakes, along with its massive stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), are set to provide the conglomerate with nearly $2 billion in dividend income over the next year.\n\nCoca-Cola: $736 million in dividend income\n\nCoca-Cola is the longest-held position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. In his 2023 shareholder letter, Buffett noted that in 1994, Berkshire completed its multiyear investment in the company -- spending a total of $1.3 billion on what are now (after a pair of 2-for-1 splits in the years that followed) the 400 million shares it still owns. It paid an average of $3.25 per split-adjusted share for that stake. That position is currently worth $24 billion and provides Berkshire Hathaway with annual dividend income of $736 million -- 56% of its original cost basis.\n\nCoca-Cola has increased its payouts for 62 consecutive years, and Buffett expects the streak to continue. If Coke raises its quarterly dividend payment by $0.02 per share in 2024 (a level consistent with its boosts in the last two years), Berkshire's dividend check will increase another $8 million to $744 million over the next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoke-branded products make up only a third of the company's annual unit case sales volume. The diversity of its brand portfolio, which includes juices, water, and teas, allows the company to market multiple beverages for different occasions and smooth out sales across geographies. Latin America has been one of the company's fastest-growing regions, posting double-digit percentage sales growth last quarter, which offset weaker results elsewhere.\n\nAnother important reason to expect Coca-Cola to remain a solid income investment is its ability to adapt to shifting consumer preferences. Coke generated nearly a third of its sales volume in 2022 from no-sugar and low-calorie products. Its success with products like Coke Zero fuels its ongoing solid results; non-GAAP (adjusted) revenue was up 11% year over year in the third quarter.\n\nMaking syrups from concentrate doesn't require a lot of capital. Coca-Cola has a globally recognizable brand and a profitable business model to keep sales, earnings, and dividends growing. Last year, it distributed 72% of its earnings via dividends. Its current yield is 3.05%.\n\nAmerican Express: $364 million in dividend income\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has owned a stake in American Express for almost as long as it has held one in Coca-Cola. The cost basis on that investment was nearly $1.3 billion, or $8.49 per share.\n\nBased on American Express' current quarterly payout of $0.60 per share, Berkshire will take in nearly $364 million in dividend income from the financial giant over the next year. At its current share price, Amex's yield is a below-average 1.32%, but it also has a low payout ratio of 21% and is growing profits at double-digit percentage rates that could support further increases in the payout.\n\nAmerican Express has similar advantages to those of Coca-Cola, such as strong brand power and a large customer base. At the end of 2022, it had over 76 million Amex cards in force worldwide and another 56 million cards issued by third-party brands.\n\nDelta Air Lines is one third-party brand that is a valuable partner for American Express. Delta offers Amex card members travel-related perks, including airport lounge access and other services. It's these benefits, along with membership rewards and exclusive discounts at top retailers, that have built American Express into a desirable card for high-income shoppers.\n\nA key advantage for American Express is that its average cardholder spends more on average than the users of other credit cards. The main advantage of this is that it gives American Express leverage with merchants in terms of setting its processing fees.\n\nA high-spending membership base is also beneficial during occasional weakness in consumer spending broadly. The soft retail spending environment over the last few years hasn't hurt American Express, which reported record revenue in 2022 and continued to post solid results in 2023. Revenue net of interest expense grew 13% year over year in 2023's third quarter, while earnings jumped 34%.\n\nThe combination of a strong brand, customer loyalty, and a large network of merchant partners explains why Buffett has held this stock for so long and why he expects the dividend to keep growing.\n\nApple: $878 million in dividend income\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Apple in 2016. After further share purchases and a 378% increase in Apple's stock price over the last five years, that stake is now worth about $167 billion. It is the largest investment Berkshire Hathaway has ever made in a single stock, and the annual dividend payout should also grow into a sizable amount over the long term.\n\nAssuming Berkshire continues to hold 915 million shares of Apple, that stake will provide it with $878 million in dividend income over the next 12 months.\n\nApple has tremendous cash resources that it can invest in technology, but it's the company's brand that Buffett values the most. In terms of its products' technological features, Apple has often lagged its competitors. And yet, Apple remarkably still sells millions of iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches every year. The iPhone is the biggest draw, bringing in $200 billion in annual revenue.\n\nApple's customers are drawn to the experience of the software behind these devices, where content is seamlessly tied together through its iCloud service. This is the heart of Apple's competitive advantage over Samsung and other smartphone rivals. While Apple controls less than 20% of the global smartphone market, it generates over 80% of the industry's profits.\n\nA lucrative business model provides Apple with an enormous edge in finances. It held $57 billion of net cash as of the end of September, but management is working to bring that down to a neutral cash position through dividends and share repurchases. Making the task more challenging is that a massive amount of profits floods into the company's coffers every year. In other words, Apple has more cash than it knows what to do with.\n\nApple is now producing $99 billion in trailing free cash flow, which could fund a growing dividend and pave the way for new products and services that widen the company's economic moat. The upcoming Vision Pro mixed-reality headset might take a while to catch on with customers given its $3,499 price tag, but it shows Apple is not going to rely solely on its existing product lineup to drive long-term growth.\n\nLike American Express, Apple also has a below-average yield, but what investors give up in yield, they make up for with dividend growth and share price appreciation. The company has more than doubled its payout over the last 10 years and boosted its share price by 873%. Given its low 15% payout ratio, Apple's dividend should grow for many years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Worst Stock Investments I Ever Made -- and What I Learned From Them",
        "content": "No investor has a perfect track record, and I'm no exception. While my long-term investment returns have been ahead of the S&P 500, there have been several times along the way where I got it wrong.\n\nI strongly believe in holding myself accountable, so without further delay, I'll share the three worst stock-investment decisions I ever made. And since I also believe that all great investors should learn from their mistakes, I'll discuss what I learned from these.\n\nMy 3 worst stock investments ever\n\nIn no particular order, here are the short versions of three investments I made that I consider to be my all-time worst.\n\nGenetics-testing company 23andMe(NASDAQ: ME) went public a few years ago with backing from billionaire investor Richard Branson. It leads the market in home DNA testing and is starting to leverage its massive data library to produce pharmaceuticals. But the business was (and still is) hemorrhaging money and now trades for about 93% less than its valuation when it went public.\n\nIn the 2021 special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) boom, a smart home technology company called Latch(OTC: LTCH) went public. It was led by a former Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) manager, and the business was gaining impressive traction in both the multifamily and office industries. However, due to several accounting mishaps and a lack of any reasonable path to profitability, Latch not only trades for a $125 million market cap but also ended up getting delisted from the Nasdaq for failing to file required financial statements.\n\nFortunately, the first two were rather small positions. The third, and perhaps my worst investment decision ever, was a stock that went up while I owned it. In mid-2011, I bought shares of a then-new electric vehicle (EV) start-up called Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). This was before the Model S started production, and when that vehicle was named Motor Trend's car of the year soon after its introduction, the stock roughly tripled in a short time frame. I sold my shares to \"lock in my profits.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis paragraph is admittedly painful to write. I paid (split-adjusted) $1.53 per share for my Tesla stock. I sold it in 2013 at $4 per share. As I'm writing this, one share of Tesla is worth about $211. I could literally buy three fully loaded Model S vehicles with the money I left on the table by selling.\n\nThe valuable lessons I learned\n\nNow, one important thing any investor should know is that even elite investors get it wrong from time to time. For example, Warren Buffett has made several billion-dollar stock investments, such as in IBM (NYSE: IBM), that didn't play out as he had hoped. I certainly don't consider myself to be anywhere close to Buffett's level, but of the 40ish stocks I own at any given time, I'm quite sure that a few will end up losing money, especially the small portion of my portfolio that I reserve for relatively speculative stocks.\n\nAs a stock investor, you'll have losing investments. That's a given. But the thing that distinguishes good long-term investors is being able to learn from the losses so you don't repeat the same mistakes. With that in mind, here are some of the lessons I learned from these three stock investments:\n\nNo matter how impressive growth is, valuation matters\n\nI'm a value investor at heart, and the majority of my portfolio is made up of stocks that have below-average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. On the other hand, I completely understand that it's fine to accept a relatively high valuation if a company is growing rapidly and has tons of future potential. For example, I own shares of Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) and MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI)d even though both look extremely expensive by most metrics.\n\nHowever, there's a difference between a high valuation and an outrageous one. At the height of the SPAC boom, there were plenty of companies trading for multiples of 50 times sales (or even more) with no clear path to profitability in sight. Latch was one of these.\n\nA great product doesn't always make a great business\n\nThis is an important lesson to learn and is a frequent topic of discussion during Shark Tank pitches. In my case, 23andMe was a great example of this. The company's consumer-genetics product is best-in-breed, and there is clearly potential in applying the genomic data from millions of customers to pharmaceuticals. But it's going to be very tough to turn it into a profitable business unless one of its treatments in development turns out to be a home run. Now, this is a $300 million market-cap company that has produced a combined operating loss of nearly $1 billion over the past four fiscal years and has burned through about $155 million in cash in the past year alone.\n\nNever sell because of price alone\n\nWhen I hit the sell button on Tesla, I only did so because it had gone up in value and I wanted to \"take profits.\" If I looked at my two top holdings at the time a little more analytically, I would have most likely determined that the other one, AT&T (NYSE: T), was the one I should have sold.\n\nThis same lesson applies whether a stock moves up or down. Unless something has fundamentally changed with the business or your personal financial situation, price isn't a great reason to sell. For example, it would be fine to sell a growth stock like Tesla because you're retiring and your risk tolerance is now lower. But selling a winner to lock in profits is a losing long-term strategy.\n\nFortunately, I've learned from these mistakes. As an example, the best-performing stock in my portfolio has been a ten-bagger in less than a decade, and the reason I still own it has a lot to do with my Tesla mistake.\n\nNo investors are perfect, and I'm definitely not an exception. But smart investors admit when they're wrong and use what they've learned to become better.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in 23andMe right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in 23andMe, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and 23andMe wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Since January 2021, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made for a fantastic investment, rising 44% during that time. This gain far outpaces the 14% rise of the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe business, known for its powerful brand and innovative culture, has a history of posting healthy revenue and earnings growth. The question, though, is whether this momentum can continue.\n\nInvestors have their attention focused on what the future might bring. With this in mind, where will this top tech stock be in three years?\n\nDiversifying revenue streams\n\nEven nearly 17 years after the first iteration was launched, Apple still generates most of its revenue from the iPhone. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), $201 billion, out of total sales of $383 billion, was derived from this incredibly lucrative smartphone.\n\nHowever, there have been changes in recent years. In fiscal 2018, the iPhone represented 63% of revenue, so we've seen that over time, its importance to the overall business declines.\n\nI think this will continue over the next three years. Apple is finding success with other popular hardware products, like the MacBook, the iPad, the Watch, and AirPods. Management just launched the Vision Pro, which it hopes can be another successful hardware device.\n\nSoftware and services are becoming extremely important to the Apple story. Offerings like iCloud, Music, TV+, and Pay provide the business with a high-margin revenue source. This segment has consistently grown faster than the products division. It's likely to become a more critical part of the company.\n\nBut if we look out three years, I believe it's likely that the iPhone will continue to be the main revenue driver for Apple. There's no evidence it won't. And because of this product's maturity, the result could be slower sales growth than shareholders have become accustomed to in past years.\n\nGenerating lots of cash\n\nWhile Apple's mix of products and services will continue to shift as we look ahead, one thing is unlikely to change anytime soon. And that's Apple's profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe financial statements are impressive. Last fiscal year, Apple reported a net profit margin of 25%. If that isn't impressive on its own, consider that this metric has been remarkably consistent at more than 20% in each of the past 10 years.\n\nTurning to the balance sheet, there's probably no other company in the world in a stronger financial position. As of Sept. 30, Apple had $162 billion in cash. And while the business carries debt of $111 billion, the interest expense of under $4 billion last year is nothing to worry about, showing that Apple pays low rates on its borrowings.\n\nBecause Apple generates so much free cash flow, more than it needs to reinvest into growth initiatives, the leadership team has been known to aggressively repurchase shares. This capital allocation strategy means that shareholders will see their ownership stakes rise over time, which is a good thing.\n\nWhat is a reasonable valuation?\n\nThere isn't any concern that Apple's business will remain on solid footing in the years ahead. However, from an investment perspective, we must also factor in the valuation to figure out what the return potential looks like.\n\nApple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently at 29.9, which is far higher than its 10-year average. For a mature and slower-growing business, this seems expensive. It's impossible to know what the P/E should be in three years. But if we assume that it drops to 25 around January 2027, which seems reasonable, this creates a 17% headwind for shareholders.\n\nGiven the valuation concerns, there's a very real possibility that investors searching for market-beating returns from Apple over the next three years will be disappointed.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the22 Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks.\n\nHedge funds on average underperformed the market in 2023 as investors continued to pull out money amid rise in bond yields, overall volatility and a changing financial landscape. But the $3.4 trillion hedge fund industry saw many blockbuster returns from select hedge funds. For example, SoMa Equity Partners posted a massive 62% gain in 2023, according to a Reuters report. Many notable hedge funds like Coatue Management of Philippe Laffont, Millennium Management of billionaire Israel Englander,  Anson Funds' Investments Master fund posted double-digit returns. Chase Coleman's Tiger Global, which was devastated in 2022 due to its tech investments, rebounded strongly in 2023 and posted  a 28.5% gain in the period, with most of the gains coming in the last quarter of the year, helped largely by tech stocks. While there's no shortage of hedge funds that performed extremely poorly during the year, you have funds like Mulvaney Capital Management which reportedly posted a 51.22% return, according to Reuters.\n\nThis mixed bag of results and the average underperformance of the hedge fund industry when compared to the S&P 500's strong returns in 2023 only prove Insider Monkey's long-held thesis about the hedge fund industry, recently summarized by its founder and research director Dr. Inan Dogan:\n\n\"Hedge funds, usually, underperform the market during bull markets and outperform during bear markets. Most investors don’t understand that hedge funds are “hedged”. When the S&P 500 Index returns 20+% like it did in 2021, it is a certainty that hedge funds will underperform. It is also a certainty that hedge funds will significantly outperform the market when the market declines 18.2% like it did in 2022. Hedge funds lost 4.25% in 2022 according to HFR. That’s an outperformance of 14 percentage points. \"\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks\n\n22. Israel Englander\n\nTop Stock Pick: Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nIsrael \"Izzy\" Englander founded Millennium Management in 1989 with Ronald Shear. As of 2023 the fund has a whopping $61 billion worth of assets under management. The hedge fund operates relative value, equity arbitrage, fixed income and quantitative strategies.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the biggest position of Millennium Management as the fund had a $1.6 billion stake in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT):\n\n“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the largest holding in our portfolio. Given its partnership with OpenAI and leading position in the cloud, Microsoft is well-positioned to profit from the boom in AI. However, due to Microsoft’s tremendous scale and diversification, the company is not dependent upon AI for its success. Microsoft’s diverse portfolio of software and cloud offerings ensures the company will thrive even if the next hot thing, like AI, fizzles out. In this way, Microsoft is emblematic of our broader investing approach. We seek to benefit from powerful trends, but we do so with an eye toward managing risk and limiting downside in case the future turns out to be less rosy than hoped for.”\n\n21. Ken Griffin\n\nTop Stock Pick: Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX)\n\nWorth about $35 billion today, Ken Griffin started Citadel LLC back in 1990. As of December 2022, the fund had assets under management worth over $62 billion.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Microsoft was the biggest position of the fund but since it would be a repetition, we focus on the fund's second-biggest holding, Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX). Citadel had a $1.1 billion stake in Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX).\n\nBaron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added to our position in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. We wrote about Boston Scientific last quarter. We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products used to treat atrial fibrillation, among others. The company held an Investor Day during the quarter at which management established financial targets for the 2024– 2026 period calling for an organic sales CAGR of 8% to 10%, 150 basis points of margin expansion and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improved free-cash-flow conversion. We think this growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.”\n\n20. John Paulson\n\nTop Stock Pick: Horizon Therapeutics Public Ltd Co. (NASDAQ:HZNP)\n\nJohn Paulson, who has a net worth of about $3.5 billion as of January 11, rose to fame in 2007 when he earned a whopping $4 billion, thanks to his bets against the U.S. subprime mortgage lending market via credit default swaps.\n\nPaulson founded Paulson & Co. in 1994. The hedge fund's biggest position as of the end of September was Horizon Therapeutics Public Ltd Co. (NASDAQ:HZNP) in which the fund had a $243 million stake.\n\n19. David Einhorn\n\nTop Stock Pick: Green Brick Partners Inc (NYSE:GRBK)\n\nDavid Einhorn founded Greenlight Capital in 1996. The fund returned 36.6% in 2022, easily outperforming the S&P 500’s fall of 18.1%. Since its launch in 1996, Greenlight Capital has returned 2,358.3% for an annualized return of 12.8% net. Over the same timeframe, the S&P 500 gained 864% for an annualized return of 8.9%.\n\nThe fund's biggest stock holding is Green Brick Partners Inc (NYSE:GRBK).\n\nHere is what Greenlight Capital has to say about Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) fell from $56.80 to $41.51 during the quarter. The company announced second quarter earnings of $1.63 per share, which far exceeded consensus estimates of $1.18 per share. Full-year estimates for 2023 and 2024 rose from $5.16 and $5.54 to $6.13 and $6.49, respectively. However, the market has become concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates, and most homebuilding stocks reversed a portion of the gains achieved earlier this year.”\n\n18. Jim Simons\n\nTop Stock Pick: Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nJames Harris Simons is an American billionaire, award-winning mathematician and hedge fund manager who founded Renaissance Technologies in 1982. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, Jim Simons’ secretive Medallion Fund — closed for outsiders — posted a whopping $55 billion in profit over the last 28 years, about $10 billion more profitable than hedge funds of giants like Ray Dalio and George Soros.\n\nRenaissance Technologies' biggest stock holding as of the end of September 2023 was Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)in which the fund had a $1.5 million stake.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our health care holdings also fared well. The sector has been largely overlooked in 2023 amid AI exuberance, but its defensiveness is looking more salutary as tighter monetary policy begins to sap market sentiment. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) shares rose on continued unprecedented demand for GLP-1s, which treat diabetes and obesity, and of which Novo Nordisk is one of two major providers. GLP-1s represent the largest commercial opportunity and investable theme in health care.”\n\n17. Cathie Wood\n\nTop Stock Pick: Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nCathie Wood is one of the most followed hedge fund managers in the Wall Street and is known for her bets on innovative, high-growth companies. In 2014, Wood founded ARK Invest. Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund ($ARKK) rallied about 70% in 2023. This was the fund's third best performance in a year since its inception.\n\nThe biggest position of ARK Invest as of the end of September 2023 was Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in which the fund had a $1 billion stake.\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.”\n\n16. Guy Spier\n\nTop Stock Pick: Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class A (NYSE:BRK.A)\n\nGuy Spier has risen to fame over the past few years, thanks to his obsession with Warren Buffett and his value principles. The author of the famous value investing book The Education of a Value Investor famously paid $650,100 along with Mohnish Pabrai to have lunch with Warren Buffett.\n\nSpier founded the Aquamarine Fund after leaving investment banking career. The fund's biggest position as of the end of the third quarter was, you guessed it, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class A (NYSE:BRK.A) as the fund owned 140,600 shares of the conglomerate.\n\n15. Michael Burry\n\nTop Stock Pick: Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA)\n\nMichael Burry is almost always in the news thanks to his blunt predictions which often warn about recessions and market crashes. The Big Short investor rose to fame after he correctly bet against the housing bubble in 2007.\n\nIn 2000, Michael Burry founded Scion Capital. The fund's biggest stock holding as of the end of September was Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA) in which the fund had a $7.6 million stake.\n\n14. Leon Cooperman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Energy Transfer LP Unit (NYSE:ET)\n\nBillionaire Leon Cooperman is the chariman and CEO of Omega Advisors, which had about $1.9 billion under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe biggest stock holding of the fund was Energy Transfer LP Unit (NYSE:ET), in which the fund had a $167 million.\n\n13. Mario Gabelli\n\nTop Stock Pick: Herc Holdings Inc (NYSE:HRI)\n\nBillionaire Mario Gabelli is the man behind GAMCO Investors, Inc., formerly known as Gabelli Asset Management Company. Gabelli is a value investor and has impressed the market with high returns over the past several years. Talking to Columbia Business School, the 81-year-old investor talked about the essence of value investing:\n\n\"Value investing isn’t focused on short-term market movements. It’s about finding the ignored and unloved companies that nobody covers for whatever reason, with a good business, solid management, and a good price. But you do need to evaluate new trends as they come up. AI, for example, might accelerate the problem of income inequality. Also, there are food, water, and energy shortages. There’s the way capital is allowed to be allocated on a global basis — the regulatory hurdles and the challenges to the free market’s system of allocation. So you have to figure out how to bridge all that.\"\n\nThe biggest stock holding of GAMCO as of the end of the third quarter of 2023 was Herc Holdings Inc (NYSE:HRI).\n\n12. David Tepper\n\nTop Stock Pick: Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper is the man behind Appaloosa Management, a Florida-based hedge fund. Tepper, who also owns Carolina Panthers, managed to post about 18% to 19% gains in 2023, according to a report by Institutional Investor.\n\nTepper's top two holdings as of the end of September were Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). But since these two stocks are already mentioned in our article as the top picks of other hedge funds, let's look at the third biggest position of the billionaire. Tepper's fund had a $477 million stake in the ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n“Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Nvidia. Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments, most notably its core e-commerce business, while Meta saw accelerated revenue growth and share gains in online advertising.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.”\n\n11. Paul Tudor Jones\n\nTop Stock Pick: Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI)\n\nBillionaire Paul Tudor Jones  founded Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980. As of the end of the September quarter the hedge fund had a portfolio worth about over $9 billion.\n\nThe biggest stake of the company was in Activision Blizzard which is now going under the ownership of Microsoft. Jones' fund had a $284 million stake in the company as of the end of the September quarter.\n\n10. Dan Loeb\n\nTop Stock Pick: PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)\n\nDaniel Seth Loeb started Third Point in 1995. The fund today has $10.8 billion in assets for sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, corporate & public pensions, high-net-worth individuals, and employees. The fund returned -2.2% on a NAV basis in September 2023, compared with a -4.3% return for the MSCI World Index and a -4.8% return for the S&P 500 Index.\n\nAs of the end of the September 2023 quarter, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) was the biggest position of the hedge fund. Third Point reported owning 57 million shares of the company.\n\n9. Bill Ackman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nBill Ackman is currently in the news for his relentless outburst against Harvard University and reports alleging his wife was involved in academic plagiarism. Regardless of this hullaballoo, Ackman is among the top money managers in the world, having started Pershing Square Capital in 2004. In 2023, Pershing returned  26.7%.\n\nAs of the end of the September quarter, the hedge fund's biggest position was Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG), in which the fund had a $1.7 billion stake. Over the past one year the stock has gained about 51%.\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the consumer discretionary sector, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) proved a detractor as investors were disappointed in management’s decision not to push additional menu pricing, which resulted in full year guidance falling short of expectations. However, we believe this is just a timing mismatch as their value proposition relative to peers leaves room for continued strong pricing power.”\n\n8. Ken Fisher\n\nTop Stock Pick:Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWorth $7.9 billion today, Ken Fisher is one of the most renowned hedge fund managers in the world. Ken Fisher founded Fisher Investments back in 1979. Fisher Investments today manages over $236 billion in assets. Ken Fisher is bullish on the market. He recently wrote in an article for that The Globe and Mail that he sees \"double-digit gains for both S&P 500 and the MSCI World Index, with tech and big growth stocks leading early on.\"\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest holding of Fisher Investments as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The fund owned a whopping $9.2 billion stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n“We meaningfully reduced our exposure to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2023. Apple is the largest company in the world and produces terrific products that engage users for hours each day. Despite the company’s size, ubiquity and relevance, however, Apple’s growth has slowed dramatically. Its fiscal 2023 earnings were flat with those of 2022. Apple trades at 30x earnings; sustaining that multiple will require a meaningful acceleration in revenues. While such an improvement is possible, we do not see any obvious catalysts for adding tens of billions of dollars to Apple’s topline. Consequently, the risk-reward skews negatively.”\n\n7. Ray Dalio\n\nTop Stock Pick: Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\n\nRay Dalio in 1975 founded Bridgewater Associates which went on to become the largest hedge fund in the world. According to Forbes, the hedge fund has over $124 billion in assets under management. According to Bloomberg, Bridgewater's flagship hedge fund lost about 7.6% in 2023, while its long-only All Weather fund climbed 10.6% in the period.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) was the biggest holding of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater as the fund reported owning a $700 million stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, Coca-Cola trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is likewise at ~27x P/E, with earnings only ~12% higher than a decade ago (or a ~1% annual growth rate). This equates to a mere 3.3% – 3.7% earnings yield.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”\n\n6. Chase Coleman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nHaving worked under legendary investor Julian Robertson, Chase Coleman rose to higher ranks in the money management industry with speed thanks to Robertson giving Coleman about $25 million after he shuttered his own fund Tiger Management. The famous tiger cub founded Tiger Global in 2001. According to Forbes, Coleman's worth today is about $5.7 billion.\n\nTiger Global's biggest stock position as of the end of September 2023 was Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), in which the fund had a $2.7 billion stake.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META):\n\n“Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and Nvidia. Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments, most notably its core e-commerce business, while Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw accelerated revenue growth and share gains in online advertising.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023.

        "title": "3 Top-Rated Dow Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are Loving Now: January 2024",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index made up of 30 blue-chip stocks that are meant to be representative of the U.S. economy. The Dow finished 2023 strong, posting a healthy gain of 13% for all of last year.\n\nSo far in 2024, the Dow 30, as the index is also known, has dipped 1% as markets try to find their footing heading into a new year. But investors needn’t worry. Analysts remain extremely bullish about many of the Dow components, even more so after some strong earnings reports were recently released.\n\nThe economy continues to exhibit strength, interest rates are expected to fall, and corporate earnings are holding up. Therefore, the Dow should have another stalwart showing in the year ahead. Let’s discuss three top-rated Dow stocks Wall Street analysts are loving now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nShares of consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up nearly 3% after analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral” and increased their price target to $225 a share from $208 previously. Bank of America said Apple should benefit from higher growth rates, driven, in part, by new artificial intelligence applications and features. Early reviews of Apple’s new Vision Pro augmented reality headset have been very strong.\n\nThe upgrade from Bank of America was sorely needed. APPL stock endured a slew of downgrades to start the year, with many analysts pointing to a slowdown in sales of the company’s devices such as its iPhone and MacBook computer. The company’s share price has also been weighed down by an ongoing patent dispute related to its Apple Watch. News that China’s economy is slowing more than expected has also hurt Apple given that it gets nearly 20% of its revenue from the nation of 1.4 billion people.\n\nWith the latest bounce, Dow component Apple’s stock is now up 39% in the last 12 months.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are loving Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) after the investment bank reported better-than-expected fourth quarter financial results. Analysts at Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY), for one, raised their price target on GS stock to $491 a share, implying 31% upside from current levels. Also, Oppenheimer maintained a buy equivalent rating on the bank’s stock. The upgrades are a reversal from last year, when Goldman Sachs was missing financial targets and its stock slumping.\n\nGoldman’s recently released Q4 numbers impressed. For the final months of 2023, the investment bank earned $5.48 per share. And this was much better than the $3.62 consensus forecast of analysts. The Q4 profit was up 51% from a year earlier.\n\nRevenue came in at $11.32 billion compared to $10.80 billion that had been expected. While fees from investment banking declined 12% in the quarter, equity trading revenue rose 26% and revenue from wealth management grew 23% year over year (YOY).\n\nGS stock is up 7% over the last 12 months.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts are increasingly bullish on big box retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) coming out of the holiday sales period.\n\nAnalysts at TD Cowen named Walmart one of their “best ideas” for 2024. Further, they gave WMT stock a price target of $188 per share, which is 17% above the current share price. The analysts like the moves that Walmart is making into e-commerce, digital advertising, and artificial intelligence (AI). Also, they say it should help the company achieve a “new retail nexus.”\n\nThe upgrade from TD Cowen comes after Walmart’s third quarter 2023 financial results beat Wall Street estimates. The world’s biggest retailer reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.53 versus $1.52 that was expected. Revenue amounted to $160.80 billion compared to anticipated $159.72 billion. Walmart said that its finances continue to get a lift from its grocery business. Additionally, its e-commerce sales increased 24% YOY in Q3. WMT stock has gained 15% in the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL.

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock represents the U.S. market’s most valuable company overtaking Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by capitalizing on AI with Co-Pilot, a $20/month add-on to Microsoft Office 365.\n\nWith 345 million subscribers, Office was a $63 billion business in 2022, with one-third of revenue coming from the U.S. If even 10% of those users buy the add-on, that’s over $8 billion in incremental revenue. The estimate is on the low side.\n\nA New Era for MSFT Stock\n\nThe consumer version of Co-Pilot will let you summarize documents on command and create graphs from Excel spreadsheets. Initially, it won’t let you generate entire slide decks from a text prompt, because it isn’t built on Microsoft Graph.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn a way, this is a price cut. Microsoft charges $30 per seat per month to corporate customers. Before January, only customers with 300 users could even buy Co-Pilot, but that requirement is now gone.\n\nSmall wonder Piper Sandlin now calls MSFT its best AI pick. Tipranks counts 37 Microsoft analysts, with all but one telling investors to buy now.\n\nAlong with the Co-Pilot announcement, Microsoft signed a $1.5 billion partnership with Vodafone (NYSE:VOD) to sell AI and cloud services across Europe and Africa. This isn’t just co-marketing. Vodafone is scrapping its own data centers, while Microsoft is investing in Vodafone’s Machine Internet operation, which will be spun out in April.\n\nRisk? What Risk?\n\nWhat of the risks of AI that companies like Microsoft partner OpenAI warned about all last year? CEO Satya Nadella has his fingers planted firmly in his ears and is whistling a happy tune.\n\n“We have to take the unintended consequences of any new technology along with all the benefits,” he told the World Economic Forum. Microsoft Co-founder Bill Gates is already on-board with that message.\n\nBut the European Union has also approved an AI Act. The European Parliament will vote it on early this year and go into effect next year. It limits biometric classification systems, harvesting of facial images, and the use of AI to limit free will. The industry is already lined up against it, fearing it will limit Europe’s ability to compete.\n\nStory continues\n\nEveryone Into the Pool\n\nCommenters are comparing this year in AI with the rise of the Internet in 1995.\n\nI happened to be around for that. I had an editor who got a 45 Mbps line to the Web that year and felt like he’d discovered fire. Maybe he had, but the publication he was editing burned down within months. Entire industries collapsed before the Internet boom itself did in 2000.\n\nMicrosoft faced government intervention and stock decline for 15 years until Nadella’s appointment and the company’s cloud commitment.\n\nThe Bottom Line on MSFT Stock\n\nMicrosoft was years late with Internet Explorer, launching it in August 1995. This time, Microsoft is leading the market. Will that make a difference in how the government treats it? Will Nadella do any better than Bill Gates did defending integration with his market-leading application suite?\n\nMost analysts take that for granted. But Co-Pilot is putting political risk into MSFT stock. That’s just what it rejected when it sold MSNBC to Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) almost 20 years ago.\n\nAI has already lifted MSFT stock by 54% in the last year, adding over $1 trillion to its market cap, lifting its price to earnings multiple to nearly 38. Everyone, it seems, is telling you to buy more. Just know that the easy money has already been made.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in MSFT and AAPL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "title": "Inflation Busters: 3 Hidden Stock Gems That Thrive in a High-Cost World",
        "content": "When investors stopped thinking about stocks to buy for high inflation, the U.K.’s Office of National Statistics (ONS) delivered a jolt to the system.\n\nOn January 17, the ONS reported that the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 0.4% in December. This pushed the annual inflation rate to 4.0% from 3.9% in November. Increasing prices for alcohol and tobacco were the culprits last month.\n\n“The prices of goods leaving factories are little changed over the last few months, while the costs of raw materials remain lower than a year ago,” Forbes reported comments from the ONS.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn Canada, Statistics Canada reported that the country’s annual inflation rate jumped up to 3.4% in December, 30 basis points higher than in November. In the U.S., the CPI rose by 0.3% in December to 3.4%, suggesting that cuts in interest rates might not come as soon as investors hoped.\n\nShould prices remain elevated for the foreseeable future, it’s not too late to buy these three stocks for high inflation. All three are in the top 10 holdings in the Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries ETF (NYSEARCA:INFL)\n\nPrairieSky Royalty (PREKF) Colorful arrows pointing at the multicolored word \"ETF\" against a cement surface\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/eamesBot\n\nPrairieSky Royalty (OTCMKTS:PREKF) is the top holding, weighted at 5.71%.\n\nThe Calgary-based PrarieSky Royalty “is a pure-play royalty company, generating royalty revenues as petroleum and natural gas are produced from our 18.3 million acres of royalty properties spanning Western Canada from Northeast British Columbia to Western Manitoba,” states the company website.\n\nThe company is a smaller version of the Texas Pacific Land Corp. (NYSE:TPL), which makes money off royalties from oil and gas produced on its land in West Texas. It is the actively managed ETF’s third-largest holding with a 5.34% weighting.\n\nPrairieSky went public in May 2014. When it went public, it had 40,000 acres per million shares of its stock outstanding. Today, it’s almost doubled, up 89%. At present, there are 246 wells producing oil on its land. Approximately 50% of the revenue generated is by private operators. Its quarterly dividend yields a reasonable 4.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE) A photo showing a Pomeranian puppy wearing glasses with dollar signs on a light background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOn the U.S. side of the 49th parallel, Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) is the fifth-largest holding at 4.61%.\n\nICE is best known for owning the New York Stock Exchange, which it acquired in 2013. However, its Exchange segment owns 13 regulated exchanges and six clearing houses in the U.S., UK, and several other countries.\n\nIt has two other operating segments – Fixed Income and Data Services and Mortgage Technology. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, Exchanges accounted for 57% of its $5.79 billion in revenue, followed by Fixed Income and Data Services (29%), and Mortgage Technology (14%).\n\nIn September 2023, the company completed its acquisition of Black Knight, a software and data analytics provider for the mortgage industry. While the Exchanges segment is the most significant revenue contributor, the other two generate more recurring revenue as a percentage of their segment’s revenue, which is the best kind.\n\nAnalysts like its stock. Of the 20 that cover it, 16 rate it either overweight or buy, with a target price of $144.50, 15% higher than its current trading spot.\n\nArcher Daniels Midland (ADM) 100 dollar bills being passed from one hand to the other. Can represent stimulus checks or payment. millionaire-maker stocks\n\nSource: Maryna Pleshkun/Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) is the ETF’s sixth-largest holding at 4.22%.\n\nTo understand what the company does, one needs to go back and look at its history since its founding by George A. Archer and John W. Daniels in 1902. The duo started with a linseed crushing business. It created linseed oil for industrial applications such as paints, sealants, and adhesives.\n\nBy 1924, it was a public company listed on the NYSE. Over the next hundred years, it continued to add products and services such as grain and soybean processing as its competencies and expertise increased.\n\nToday, it has three operating segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds (77% of revenue), Carbohydrate Solutions (14%), and Nutrition (9%). Despite the two latter segments only generating 23% of the revenue, they account for 33% of the operating products.\n\nIn the Nutrition segment, one of its products is Proud Paws, a line of dry cat and dog food. It’s got its hands into virtually everything to do with food ingredients.\n\nOne reason that’s probably kept a lot of investors away from ADM is its low operating margins. In Q3 2023, they were less than 7%. Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) is around 30%, more than 4x ADM’s.\n\nDespite the thin margins, its five-year annualized total return, up 12.04%, is reasonable.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Roar Higher in 2024: 2 Surefire Growth Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "All three major indexes slipped into bear territory in 2022, and ever since, one question has been on investors' minds: When will the next bull market arrive? It's impossible to answer that question with 100% accuracy, but a couple of things offer us reason to be optimistic that a bull market may be on the way.\n\nFirst, bear markets always lead to bull markets, so down times are temporary. Second, a look at history shows us the Nasdaq Composite has a good chance of roaring higher in 2024. The index surged 43% last year, surpassing gains of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, which climbed 13% and 24%, respectively. And a look at Nasdaq's performance over time shows that after every year of rebounds from a bear market, the index has gone on to climb for a second year.\n\nIn fact, after each annual loss of more than 10%, the Nasdaq went on to gain an average of 56% over the following two years. This shows that, if the index follows its pattern so far, the Nasdaq has plenty of room to run this year, and this makes now a great time to invest in quality growth stocks. These are companies that have shown their ability to increase earnings over time, and these players also offer solid long-term prospects. So, by scooping up shares of these companies, you could score a win in the near term and over time. Let's check out two surefire growth stocks to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) revenue and profit have soared over time, and so have other key measures like free cash flow and return on invested capital. This shows the technology giant has what it takes to consistently turn increasing revenue into profit -- and make wise investment decisions. AAPL Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nAAPL Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts.\n\nThe share price has followed, helping the company reach a market value of more than $2.8 trillion. It's clear Apple has a track record of success.\n\nAll of this is thanks to the company's brand strength. Customers keep coming back to snap up the latest iPhone or Mac and haven't been easily lured away by rival products. This strength represents a moat, or competitive advantage, that should keep the momentum going.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn top of this ability to keep current customers loyal, Apple also continues to gain new fans. In the most recent quarter, for example, half of Mac and iPad buyers were new to those particular products. And Apple continues to innovate, with its latest product -- the Apple Vision Pro spatial computer -- set to launch early next month.\n\nToday, more than 2 billion people around the world use Apple devices, and this leads me to the subject of Apple's next big growth driver. I'm talking about the services Apple offers these device users -- from cloud storage to digital content. In the most recent quarter, services revenue reached a record high, and that should continue thanks to this enormous (and growing) number of Apple users. Even better, Apple's services margins are significantly higher than product margins -- 70% vs. 36% in the recent quarter.\n\nAll of this means Apple, even after gains of 48% last year, has a lot of fuel in the tank. And in a market favoring growth, this top stock could easily rocket higher.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in two markets set to grow in the double digits this decade: e-commerce and cloud computing. And the company is likely to maintain its dominance thanks to moves it's made over the past couple of years. A difficult 2022 that led to Amazon reporting its first annual loss in nearly a decade prompted these moves.\n\nRising inflation weighed on Amazon's costs and on its customers' wallets. So Amazon decided to revamp its cost structure and transform itself into a stronger company that not only could recover from difficult times but could excel in better times.\n\nAmazon focused on boosting efficiency across its fulfillment network, investing in high-growth areas and supporting its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers by offering them lower-cost tools during tough economic times. All of these efforts have been bearing fruit, with Amazon shifting from billion-dollar outflows of cash and declines in operating income to growth. In the latest quarter, operating income quadrupled, and the company reported free cash flow of more than $21 billion.\n\nMoving forward, the company's move to a regional fulfillment model from a national one could continue to lower Amazon's costs and increase revenue. By dispatching packages from centers closer to your home, Amazon spends less money on the task, and you receive your order more quickly. Amazon is also introducing an ad-supported tier to its Prime Video offer, a move that could add billions to revenue, analysts predict.\n\nAs for AWS, Amazon's investment in artificial intelligence (AI) may make the company a winner in the potential AI revolution. That's big news considering AWS generally has driven profit at Amazon.\n\nAfter an 80% increase last year, Amazon, like Apple, has plenty of potential for more gains. And that's why, if the Nasdaq follows its historical pattern in 2024, this market giant could once again roar higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "TD-Bank-gs0119-\n\nToronto-Dominion Bank took the top spot as Canada’s most valuable brand in 2024, according to an annual report by consultant Brand Finance PLC.\n\nGlobally, TD came in at No. 100, down from last year’s spot at 93, on the Brand Finance Global 500 2024 report, which puts the world’s 5,000 biggest brands to the test and ranks the top 500 most valuable brands.\n\nStill, TD exhibited “robust performance” around “consideration and familiarity” as the most recognized banking brand in Canada, the report said. Almost three-quarters of respondents are familiar with the brand and 31 per cent are currently using its services, which helped give it a brand value of US$19 billion.\n\n“This steady market presence speaks to TD’s enduring appeal in the industry,” the report said.\n\nA total of 17 Canadian brands, with a combined brand value of US$155.6 billion, made the cut.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada ranked No. 2 in the country and No. 119 in the world, with a brand value of US$16.4 billion, was up 11 per cent from last year. Canada Life Assurance Co., with a brand value of US$11.6 billion  — up seven per cent from 2023 — took the third spot in Canada and was No. 178 globally.\n\nBrookfield Corp. was Canada’s fastest growing brand, jumping 44 spots to No. 183 in the global ranking. Its brand value increased by an “impressive” 29 per cent to US$11.5 billion, according to the release.\n\nApple Inc. reclaimed the top spot as the world’s most valuable global brand this year, achieving “remarkable” growth of 74 per cent, or US$219 billion, to US$517 billion.\n\nThe tech giant has maintained its position as the dominant player in the premium smartphone market with a 71 per cent value share even though iPhone’s volume share has largely plateaued. The report attributes the company’s success to finding new markets, expanding its ecosystem and encouraging upgrades to higher-value iPhones.\n\n“Apple has grown its brand value through strategic diversification and premiumization, moving away from heavy reliance on iPhone sales towards ventures into wearables and services such as Apple TV subscriptions,” David Haigh, chairman and chief executive of Brand Finance, said in the release. “According to our research, more than 50 per cent of respondents recognized Apple as expensive, but worth the price, reinforcing the brand’s ability to demand a price premium.”\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, Tesla Inc. dropped out of the top 10 and fell to No. 18 in the ranking as its brand value dropped 12 per cent to US$58.3 billion. Brand Finance said the electric-vehicle maker’s close association with Elon Musk — the company’s chief executive — has created “added reputational risk” for the brand, and it has also been “harmed” by its large exposure to the Chinese EV market.\n\nTD expects $141 million from Schwab as U.S. banks report Brookfield real estate fund tumbles 6.7% for first yearly loss Lululemon aims to double sales by 2026, targeting more men\n\nOther Canadian brands included on the list were Circle K (owned by Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.), Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Telus Corp., Bell (Owned by BCE Inc.), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canadian National Railway Ltd., Lululemon Athletica Inc., Tim Hortons (owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc.), Rogers Communications Inc., Manulife Financial Corp., Enbridge Inc. and Burger King (also owned by Restaurant Brands International).\n\n• Email: novid@postmedia.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — The S&P 500 Index set new closing and intraday highs for the first time in two years Friday, capping a stunning rebound from 2022’s violent selloff.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union China’s $6.3 Trillion Stock Selloff Is Getting Uglier by the Day Musk’s AI Startup Secures $500 Million Toward $1 Billion Funding Goal Burger King Is Serving Whoppers With a Side of Cringe Ford Cuts Workforce Making Electric F-150s on Weak Demand\n\nThe resurgence is being powered by the so-called Magnificent Seven technology companies — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — and it’s largely based on investors’ hopes for artificial intelligence and cost-cutting efforts that fueled a profit boom at those firms.\n\nIt’s also getting significant help from a Federal Reserve that appears to be done raising interest rates and starting to consider when to begin cutting after the biggest monetary tightening campaign in decades.\n\nHere’s a look at the S&P 500’s wild round trip:\n\nThe road from a previous record in January 2022 took 512 trading sessions. That’s the longest dry spell in more than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHistorically, however, the 512-day streak isn’t quite as impressive. In the 1970s, the S&P 500 went more than seven years without a record as inflation skyrocketed and growth stagnated.\n\nAfter peaking two years ago, the S&P 500 shed as much as a quarter of its value before hitting a closing low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022. Since then, it has added more than $10 trillion in market value while rebounding from the 2022 selloff, the worst year for the index since the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nThe last rout came as fast-growing tech companies got pummeled by rising interest rates. In addition, Russia’s war with Ukraine created a humanitarian crisis in Europe, oil prices soared past $100 a barrel and parts of the Treasury yield curve inverted.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe information technology, communication services and consumer-discretionary sectors led the S&P 500’s bounce back in 2023. They also house the Magnificent Seven technology companies.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, the seven-largest companies in the S&P 500 outperformed the rest of the index by the most since the dot-com bubble. Apple crossed back above a $3 trillion market capitalization in December after rallying nearly 50% last year.\n\nNvidia, whose stock skyrocketed in 2023 following a massive sales forecast in May that ignited AI excitement, takes the title as top percentage-gain contributor to the S&P 500 since October 2022, rallying over 400%, followed by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Meta and Broadcom Inc.\n\nIn terms of index-point contributions, Microsoft holds the top spot, adding 156.90 points. Nvidia added 141.54 points, while Apple contributed 95.40 points, with Meta and Amazon rounding out the top five.\n\nFirst Republic Bank and SVB Financial Group were the two worst performers in the S&P 500 last year, as multiple regional lenders collapsed. First Republic plunged nearly 100% and ultimately was taken over by JPMorgan Chase & Co., while SVB lost almost 70% following the failure of its Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary.\n\nOther major decliners in that span were Lumen Technologies Inc., Advance Auto Parts Inc. and Enphase Energy Inc., each of which shed about 60%. Most of these worst performers are no longer in the S&P 500.\n\n—With assistance from Alexandra Semenova.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "title": "Apple Vision Pro's long-term pricing will be a 'game changer'",
        "content": "Apple's (AAPL) latest piece of consumer tech, its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, is set to launch in the United States on February 2. At a starting price of $3,499, Bank of America Securities Senior IT Hardware Analyst Wamsi Mohan comments on future price points that may be more encouraging for Apple customers to purchase the augmented/virtual reality device.\n\n\"When you think about the size of the VR market, it's about 8.5 million units a year, it's about $4.5 billion,\" Mohan says. \"So Apple's already making a dent in its own category in year one.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- At Apple's next big product, Wamsi, so the mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro. We've had some analysts, Wamsi, come on they say listen, near term, they don't think it's going to be financially material. But longer term, they're more optimistic. Where are you at?\n\nWAMSI MOHAN: Yeah, so it's funny to talk about financial immateriality when you can do $700, $800 million in revenue, right? Like 200,000 units at 3,500 to 4,000, that's the kind of number we're looking at. And yes, in the context of a $400 billion revenue company it's not a big number, but in isolation it really is. When you think about the size of the VR market, right, it's about eight million units a year, it's about $4 and 1/2 billion. So Apple's already making a dent in its own category, right, in year one.\n\nWe think over time this is going to be a real game changer. The way we think about it is really, anyone who has a Mac is potentially someone who could own the Vision Pro at $1,500 to $2,000 price point. We think we get to that price point in a couple of years. It's not immediate. It takes a little time. It gives time for development of apps for a lot of the app ecosystem around Vision Pro to get a lot more better.\n\nBut the place where we see the most opportunity is if we can build out an install base of several tens of millions of the Vision Pro. You can get very unique experiences of content, whether it be a concert very immersive experience of that, or sports, which other people have tried and failed, but we would give Apple the benefit of the doubt in doing something like that, and then being able to monetize. It you can pay $20, $30, $40.\n\nI was in Vegas for the CES show, and I looked up how much U2 tickets were going for the Sphere, $750 at the Sphere in Las Vegas. So $20, $30, $40 for an immersive experience, I think absolutely consumers would pay that. When you layer that on a tens of millions install base, it's a huge opportunity for Apple.",

        "title": "Monopoly Definition and 11 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 11 near-monopoly stocks in the US. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nA pure monopoly, by definition, refers to a company with no competition whatsoever – a sole provider of a particular product or service. An illustration of this was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which, at one point, stood as the exclusive seller of software and operating systems for computers, leaving consumers with only one option for these products. The connection between monopolies and U.S. consumers is rife with contradictions. Americans harbor suspicions about companies that wield a dominant influence over their industries, closely monitoring how these entities leverage their size and market dominance to maximize profits. Paradoxically, while Americans express concerns about monopolistic power, they readily embrace the advantages associated with economies of scale. Large market leaders are often preferred over small family businesses attempting to compete, fostering an environment that encourages rather than discourages the expansion of market share by substantial corporations.\n\nMonopolies wield significant pricing power, a crucial factor that investor Warren Buffett carefully considers when selecting stocks for his globally tracked portfolio. During his 2011 testimony before the US Congress, Buffett cited pricing power as a vital criterion for evaluating a business. He emphasized that a business with the ability to increase prices without losing market share to competitors exhibits a robust business model.\n\nWhile pure monopolies are rare, some contemporary companies exhibit what can be termed near-monopolies. Benefiting from economies of scale, these corporations establish formidable barriers that discourage new entrants from challenging their dominance. Market leaders like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have penetrated a sector and captured a substantial portion of the market are deemed as some of the best monopoly stocks in that regard. In a bid to expand their market share and revenue, these companies often diversify their product offerings. While they may allows some space for competition, companies like the ones mentioned above boast considerable market power, exerting significant influence over the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn theory, a near-monopoly may not pose a problem, but in practice, such a system may not work in the best interests of consumers unless it is closely monitored. In the absence of competition, monopolies may set excessive prices, offer poor-quality products, and eliminate alternatives to maximize their own profits. While the law doesn't outright prohibit monopolies, various regulations have been implemented to ensure that such companies operate fairly. The Sherman Antitrust Act is a significant piece of legislation used to break up companies that hinder competition and prevent mergers and acquisitions that could lead to a virtual monopoly. While these regulations may limit the profits of monopolies, investors often find these stocks appealing. The substantial market share held by monopolies is likely to contribute to growth and value over time, mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security. Monopoly Definition and 11 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe've identified 11 stocks in the US that exhibit near-monopoly characteristics based on their substantial market share. Several of these companies are part of the FAANG group. The major technology corporations within this list maintain a dominant market presence across various sectors, such as cloud computing, e-commerce, mobile application services, mobile operating systems, search engines, social networking, and web browsers. Additionally, the remaining stocks in the selection assert near-monopoly positions in diverse sectors, including alcoholic beverages, personal credit rating, and satellite radio. The rankings are determined by the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks as of Q3 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 9\n\nPearson plc (NYSE:PSO) is a British multinational publishing and education company with its headquarters in London. Initially established as a construction business in the 1840s, it transitioned to publishing in the 1920s. The company holds the distinction of being the largest publisher of educational materials and textbooks globally.\n\nPearson plc(NYSE:PSO)  generates approximately two-thirds of its revenue and profit from the US market. With a market share exceeding 40%, the company is a dominant force in the fields of assessment, publishing, and online program management in the US. In contrast, the remaining segment of the education publishing and assessment service market is highly fragmented, with numerous smaller players.\n\nAt the end of Q3 2023, 9 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO), a slight increase from the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $15.87 million. Among these hedge funds, 13D Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3 2023.\n\nMuch like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) operates as one of the best monopoly stocks in the US.\n\n10. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), is an American brewing company with its headquarters situated in St. Louis, Missouri. Currently recognized as the world's largest brewing company. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV possesses an array of global brands, including renowned names such as Budweiser, Michelob, Stella Artois, and Beck's.\n\nWhile the company has suffered controversies in the past few months, it continues to hold the distinction of being the largest beer producer globally by volume. In 2022, the company achieved a staggering global production volume of 595 million hectoliters, representing over 25% of the total global beer production. Furthermore, Anheuser-Busch InBev Sa/NV (NYSE:BUD) reported robust financial figures with a revenue of $57.7 billion and a net income approaching $6 billion in 2022.\n\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was one of the largest shareholders in Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) at the end of the third quarter of 2023, holding 1.7 million shares valued at $94.17 million. Overall, 21 hedge funds reported holding stakes in the company as of the end of the quarter.\n\nIn its Q2 2023 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management, a boutique investment firm, commented about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD). Here is what the firm said:\n\n“The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.”\n\n9. Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\n\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI) is a U.S.-based broadcasting corporation with its headquarters located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.

(NYSE:MO) stands out as a notable American corporation, recognized as one of the largest manufacturers and promoters of tobacco, cigarettes, and associated products on a global scale. The company operates globally from its headquarters in Henrico County, Virginia. Boasting an impressive 54-year record of consistently increasing dividends, Altria Group, Inc.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s largest shareholder in the third quarter remained Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway which owned 915.56 million shares that are worth $156 billion.\n\nA member of the Big Five, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), much like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), is one of the best monopoly stocks in the US.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds highlighted a few stocks and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“After a strong start to the year, shares of Apple Inc. partially retraced their gains this quarter. Mixed second calendar quarter financial results, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue coming in just shy of consensus expectations, coupled with elevated investor concerns about the macro economy and potential weakness in consumer spending later this year, pressured shares. Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On top of these trends in the core business, Apple is thoughtfully investing in new categories like augmented reality, search, financial services, and streaming media content. We took advantage of weakness in the quarter to add to our position in Apple.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nKen Griffin Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates’ Top 15 Dividend Stocks 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure. None.

        "content": "Pre-orders have begun for Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro headset, which will be available in the US on February 2, with delivery dates slipping as far as March.\n\nThe device's most popular use case, for most people, will be gaming, but it could also assist with productivity and watching 3D videos.\n\nYahoo Finance’s Dan Howley breaks down the pre-order process and weighs in on whether this system can be beneficial outside of gaming.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJARED BLIKRE: It's preorder day for Apple's Vision Pro headset. This comes following a rough start to 2024 for the tech giant. Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan, what are the details here?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Hey, Jared. Right now I'm actually coming through the setup process to try to get one of these. When you do, you're going to have to have an iPhone or iPad with you basically to take a scan of your face. It's going to tell you to look up, down, left, right kind of similar to what you do when you set up face ID. And that's the way that it takes measurements for you to ensure that you're getting a right fit when you have this.\n\nThe big reason why you want a good fit is because you don't want light leaking in to take you away from that immersive experience that Apple's offering. So far though, it looks like there are backups as far as the delivery date. So they're appear to be slipping as far away as March. It's going to take quite a while.\n\nI just set one up, $3,500, $3,499. I set one up with Zeiss Optical inserts for my glasses, $4,147 is what I would pay. I don't think I got paid this week, so it's not happening.\n\nBut I do think that it's something worth watching to see how many people actually buy and how long those delivery times end up getting delayed just because it shows how much people are interested in this product. And it's still a nascent market, but you know we've seen Meta in here for quite a while and it hasn't taken off as much as maybe Mark Zuckerberg would have hoped. So we'll have to see if Apple can stoke these fires.\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And Dan, what do you think the most popular use cases for this device are going to be? Not just in the near term, but kind of farther out. Do you think this is going to be-- listen, this is really going to be for gamers? Is it going to be for people watching movies, or sports, or are people going to use it at work?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I mean, hands down, the reason why people have these headsets right now is gaming, right? And so if you're not a gamer or you're not even you know interested in gaming at all, then it's not really a system for you. That's how it is with the Meta Quest.\n\nThere are some work options where you can dip into meetings and things like that. But let's face it, you don't want to turn on your camera on your laptop for a meeting, you're not going to want to strap on a headset for a meeting. You don't want to see something-- someone in the flesh, you don't want to see a virtual version of them either.\n\nThe thing that I think Apple is banking on is that you would use this as a productivity device to extend your screen. So you would look down at your Mac and then, oh, here's a giant version of that screen up here. That's very cool. I got to look at a version of that.\n\nThe other is watching interactive videos or 3D videos, things like that. When I tried it in June at WWDC, I got to see a version-- a 3D version of the \"Avatar\" movie, which looked very cool, you know. I got to say the overall between any of the devices that I've used, the Vision Pro is the best. The fidelity for the screen is amazing. You put it on and you see the pass through and it looks great.\n\nI think the real question is, do people want something like this? And if so, why? I've said it before, I have a 65-inch OLED TV, I have my PlayStation there. I can get up and walk to the fridge, I can lay down, I don't have to worry about a headset. I'll have to see when I get my hands on the Vision Pro if that makes me change my mind.",

        "content": "Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 23.\r\n\r\nFor fourth-quarter 2023, Texas Instruments expects revenues between $3.93 billion and $4.27 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.11 billion, indicating a decline of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nManagement expects earnings in the range of $1.35-$1.57 per share for the quarter under review. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.46 per share, indicating a decline of 31.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nTXN’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same on one occasion, delivering an average surprise of 4.9%.\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nTexas Instruments’ product portfolio strength and expanding manufacturing capabilities are expected to get reflected in its upcoming quarterly results.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strong investments in growth avenues and competitive advantages are expected to have been the positives.\r\n\r\nTexas Instruments’ continuous returns to shareholders are anticipated to have acted as tailwinds. Its deepening focus on accelerating free cash flow generation is likely to have been another positive. The impacts of all these factors are expected to be reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter results.\r\n\r\nHowever, widespread weakness in the industrial and communication equipment markets might have been a major headwind.\r\n\r\nA weakening demand environment, primarily due to inventory reductions by customers, is expected to have impacted the performance of both Analog and Embedded Processing segments during the quarter to be reported.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog revenues is pegged at $3.05 billion, implying a decline of 14.3% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for Embedded Processing revenues is pinned at $826 million, indicating a decline of 1.3% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nMacroeconomic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions and rising inflation are expected to have weighed on TXN in the quarter under review.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Texas Instruments this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as elaborated below.\r\n\r\nTexas Instruments currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +0.12%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies worth considering from the same space, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and sports a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \r\n\r\nApple is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAPL’s earnings is pegged at $2.08 per share, indicating a rise of 10.6% from the prior-year quarter's level.\r\n\r\nAlphabet GOOGL has an Earnings ESP of +8.17% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 30.

        "title": "Apple Vision Pro pre-orders begin: Is it worth the price?",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) will begin taking pre-orders for its latest wearable technology: the Vision Pro mixed reality headset. The price tag for the device comes in at $3,499, or $291.58 per month over 12 months. With such a high price tag and several augmented/virtual reality competitors already on the market, is the device even worth it for consumers?\n\nThe Verge Senior Wearables Reviewer Victoria Song joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Apple's AR-VR device and what it could mean for the company going forward.\n\nWhen asked if the device will be worth it for Apple, Song points out: \"This is a new category. Any time... people like myself have looked at a new Apple category when it launches, there's a tendency to go, 'Oh, who's going to use that?'\" Uncertain about the Vision Pro's starting price, Song believes \"it's going to take a while\" for Apple to reach a reasonable sales price and use case for average consumers.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: Victoria, in terms of priority that this is going to be for Apple down the line, and the fact that this could potentially-- Bank of America making the argument that it could potentially boost sales of iPhone over the next couple of years, given the fact that people are going to be upgrading their phones to better be able to use some of this latest AR and VR, AI type of capability here.\n\nWhen it comes to that demand and how big of a driver this could be for Apple's revenue down the line, what are you hearing? Or what are you expecting?\n\nVICTORIA SONG: Yeah. That's really hard to say just because this is a new category. Anytime people like myself have looked at a new Apple category when it launches, there's a tendency to go like, oh, who's going to use that? There were people who were skeptic of the iPhone. There were people who were skeptics of the Apple Watch and for the iPad. And largely, they were proven wrong. But sometimes, it takes a while to get there.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is a very emerging category. It's extremely nascent. The price tag is pretty big. And from what I saw of the spatial videos, and the spatial photos, I don't think we necessarily, as a culture, know what we want from those things. So it's going to be a matter of early adopters glomming on first and seeing what they have to say. But as for the average person, I think it's going to take a while.\n\nI think it's going to take Apple a while to figure out how they want the average person to view this device and how they want to use it. App developers are going to have to get on board en masse. And while there's going to be a lot of apps available at launch, there's a question as to how much are going to be natively available for Vision OS.\n\nSo this is a wait and see type of thing. And it's a lot of, how much do you want to bet against Apple given their track record? And then how much do you believe in VR? So it's a wishy-washy answer. But I wouldn't bet against Apple. But this is the most far out of left field that they've gone in a long time.",

        "content": "In April 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched the first Apple computer, marking the beginning of what would become a technology powerhouse. At age 21, Jobs sold his Volkswagen bus for $1,500, while Wozniak sold his Hewlett-Packard calculator for $500. Together, the sales provided the funds for their initial venture​​.\n\nWith this capital, Jobs and Wozniak embarked on producing the Apple I, introduced on April Fools Day in 1976. Their innovative approach soon paid off. A local computer dealer placed a substantial order for 100 units for $50,000, a significant milestone for the fledgling company. To meet this demand, they purchased parts on credit, giving them a tight timeframe of one month to fulfill the order. Leveraging the support of family and friends, they completed the order, earning their first revenue and narrowly managing to pay off the parts suppliers with just a day to spare.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban’s startup investment strategyaccording to his colorful portfolio. Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.\n\nJobs and Wozniak's ingenuity continued to fuel Apple Inc.’s growth. They later met Armas Clifford \"Mike\" Markkula, a former manager at Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. and Intel Corp., who played a crucial role in the company’s development. Markkula assisted in crafting a business plan and invested $92,000, in addition to helping arrange a $250,000 credit line. This financial support was instrumental in Apple’s first hit product.\n\nThe Apple I, marketed for $666.66 each, earned the company around $774,000. Following the launch of the Apple II, Apple’s sales skyrocketed to $139 million, three years after its release.\n\nThe pivotal moment for Apple came in 1980 when it became a publicly traded company. On its first day of trading, Apple’s market value reached $1.2 billion. By the end of the day, the market capitalization stood at $1.8 billion, a remarkable achievement considering the company started in Jobs' garage.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\n\nHowever, the journey was not without its challenges. Apple faced significant design flaws in its subsequent products, leading to recalls and consumer disappointment. This period saw IBM surpass Apple in sales, compelling Apple to compete in an IBM/PC-dominated market.\n\nIn 1983, Jobs recruited John Sculley from Pepsi-Cola to be CEO of Apple. The following year, they released the Macintosh, marketing it as part of a counterculture lifestyle. Despite its positive sales and superior performance to IBM's PCs, the Macintosh struggled with compatibility issues with IBM systems.\n\nBecause of internal disagreements and strategic differences, Jobs was eventually phased out of the company he co-founded and left Apple in 1985.\n\nJobs returned to Apple as CEO in 1997. He played a pivotal role in reviving the company, which was facing financial turmoil and was said to be on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nOver the years, Apple transformed from a personal computer company to a leader in cutting-edge digital products. By the time of Jobs’ death in 2011, Apple had achieved a market value of $391 billion, a testament to his vision, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHedge funds intend to snatch all pre-IPO shares of future AI unicorns before you can.

        "title": "AMD’s Record High Shows AI-Fueled Chip Rally Has Another Gear",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is on track for its best week since November, outpacing even AI-darling Nvidia Corp., as optimism builds anew around the semiconductor industry’s growth prospects.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYouTube and Spotify Won’t Launch Apple Vision Pro Apps, Joining Netflix Ford Cuts Workforce Making Electric F-150s on Weak Demand Putin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union Blinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down China’s Biggest Broker Curbs Short Sales After Stock Rout\n\nAMD shares closed at a record high on Thursday and rose again in early trading Friday. They’re up roughly 65% since October, handily beating both Nvidia and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in that period. AMD has surged roughly 12% this week, outpacing a nearly 6% leap for Nvidia, which is also climbing Friday and set an all-time high Thursday.\n\nInvestors see huge growth potential for chips and expect that Nvidia “won’t be the sole winner,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “Investors are looking for a catch-up trade” after Nvidia’s stellar performance in the past year, he said.\n\nSemiconductor shares got a boost overall on Thursday from better-than-expected fourth quarter results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The main chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia said it expects revenue growth of at least 20% for the year, after a slump in 2023.\n\nRead more: TSMC’s Outlook Backs Hopes for Global Tech Recovery in 2024\n\nAMD shares got a lift early this week when analysts at firms including Barclays Plc, Susquehanna Financial and TD Cowen boosted their price targets.\n\nOf those three, Barclays now has the highest target at $200 per share, raising it from $120 on the potential for artificial intelligence as a driver. The stock traded as high as $167 on Friday. More than 70% of analysts covering AMD have a buy-equivalent rating, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nRead more: AMD CEO Debuts Nvidia Chip Rival, Gives Eye-Popping Forecast\n\nStory continues\n\nRisks Ahead\n\nIn a sign of how the Street has struggled to keep up with the stock’s ascent, the average 12-month price target of around $150 implies a drop of about 9%.\n\nSome of that gap is due to AMD’s recent rally - the stock price only overtook the average analyst price target in December after months below the level.\n\nAnalysts can also be slow to update target prices and ratings, especially in the weeks before an earnings release. Both AMD and Nvidia have upcoming earnings reports that will give investors a sense of their growth outlook for the year ahead. AMD releases results on Jan. 30, and Nvidia in late February.\n\nThe reason Nvidia has surged so much and continues to be a favorite is its booming revenue growth, which gives it a cheaper valuation than many peers. Nvidia trades at about 28 times forward earnings, a premium to the semiconductor share benchmark at about 23. AMD trades at a multiple of more than 40.\n\n“Those stocks are more than fully valued at this point, especially AMD,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, adding that AMD has more to prove because earnings haven’t come through yet. “It’s not a good setup for the bulls right now.”\n\nIf the rally in chipmakers fades, it could present an opportunity to those who are bullish on AI’s long-term prospects, Young said.\n\n“These are definitely stocks you want to buy on any weakness, but just tactically you probably don’t want to chase them here today,” he said.\n\nStill, the sector’s strength to start the year shows that the enthusiasm around AI that propelled chipmaker shares and the tech sector in 2023 hasn’t faded, even as a rally in the S&P 500 Index appears to have stalled.\n\n“If you believe in AI then you believe in the broadening of the opportunity — it’s not just one or two companies that are going to take that share,” said Will Rhind, chief executive officer of GraniteShares. “This is just reinforcing the narrative that AI has a lot more room to run.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAnother dismal week for Chinese equities saw grim milestones pile up. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech Index, which hosts the likes of Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Xiaomi Corp., is already down 17% in 2024 after three straight years of losses. The index has seen about $1.8 trillion wiped out since a February 2021 peak.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nApple Inc.’s long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will finally be available for preorders on Friday, giving the company its first real taste of consumer demand for the $3,499 device.\n\nApple vowed to open up its coveted tap-to-pay technology on iPhones to rivals in a bid to sidestep potentially massive European Union antitrust fines. Amazon.com Inc.’s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot Corp. is expected to be blocked by the European Union’s antitrust regulator over concerns that the deal will harm other robot vacuum makers. When fast fashion giant Shein firmed up plans for a US initial public offering late last year, the online retailer hoped that it wouldn’t be subjected to regulatory review in China.

        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks — Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META — had a stellar 2023. The solid trend has continued with the start of 2024 on the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) craze, with the exception of Apple and Tesla.\r\n\r\nApple has been struggling, with shares plunging 2% on concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Meanwhile, Tesla dropped nearly 12%, driven by price cuts of its electric vehicles in China and Europe as well as supply chain delays due to a crisis in the Red Sea (read: Microsoft & Apple in Tug-Of-War: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nHowever, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for \"Magnificent Seven\" are expected to grow 38.4% from the same period last year on 12.4% higher revenues. This would follow the 54.2% earnings growth for the group in the third quarter on 12.9% higher revenues.\r\n\r\nAmong the group of companies, Tesla is set to report first on Jan 24, followed by Microsoft on Jan 30.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $2.09 per share, indicating a change of +11.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.7%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +7.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Apple.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $117.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $393.49 billion and $418.43 billion estimates indicate +2.7% and +6.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $89.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.7%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.29 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.57%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Apple surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Logitech (LOGI) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?",
        "content": "Logitech International LOGI is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan 22.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.23 billion, indicating a decrease of 3.2% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for non-GAAP earnings stands at $1.12 per share, suggesting a decline of 1.8% year over year. Earnings estimates for the third quarter have remained unchanged in the past 60 days.\n\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 30.4%.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement.\n\nLogitech International S.A. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLogitech International S.A. price-eps-surprise | Logitech International S.A. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nLogitech’s fiscal third-quarter earnings are likely to have been negatively impacted by the weakened demand for personal computers (PCs), the main sales booster for its PC peripheral products. Per the latest International Data Corporation report, worldwide PC shipments declined 2.7% year over year to 67.1 million units in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, Logitech benefited from the elevated demand for its Video Collaboration, PC Webcams, Keyboards & Combos and Pointing Device tools, mainly driven by the heightening of work-from-home and learn-from-home trends.\n\nHowever, the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues enhanced global recessionary concerns, thereby prompting enterprises to postpone their large IT spending plan. Furthermore, continued industry layoffs due to growing recessionary concerns are hampering the demand for PC peripheral products by organizations.\n\nAdditionally, a lack of the need for product refreshes is expected to have negatively impacted the demand for Logitech’s products in the to-be-reported quarter. The majority of the global working population refreshed PCs and related peripheral products about two years ago in the wake of the pandemic-led work-from-home trend.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur estimates for Logitech’s Video Collaboration and Keyboards & Combos third-quarter revenues are pegged at $171.2 million and $213.4 million, respectively. The estimated revenue figures for Video Collaboration and Keyboards & Combos depict a year-over-year decline of 1.6% and 3%, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the softened demand for gaming products and accessories is likely to have hurt Logitech’s Gaming category’s performance in the third quarter. The demand for gaming products shot up due to the growing popularity of online video games and eSports amid the stay-at-home scenario during the pandemic. However, the demand softened due to the reopening of economic and business activities. Our estimate suggests the company’s Gaming revenues will decline 13.5% year over year to $356.6 million in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nFurthermore, declining consumer spending amid high inflation and interest rates is likely to have hurt the demand for Logitech’s Headsets. Our estimate of $46.6 million for Headsets revenues implies a decline of 0.9%.\n\nHowever, we expect revenues from the Tablet & Other Accessories, Pointing Devices and Webcams business units to increase 7.9%, 3.8% and 1.7%, respectively, in the third quarter. Our third-quarter revenue estimates for Tablet & Other Accessories, Pointing Devices and Webcams business units are currently pegged at $70.3 million, $206.6 million and $94.6 million, respectively.\n\nHowever, the company’s cost-saving initiative, which includes headcount reduction, is likely to have partially offset the negative impacts of the aforementioned factors on profitability.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for LOGI this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nThough Logitech carries a Zacks Rank #2, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, Amazon.com AMZN, Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nAmazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +10.48%. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 1. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 54.9%.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Sell in January Before They Crash and Burn",
        "content": "U.S. equities are not off to a great start in 2024. The Nasdaq is down two-quarters of a percentage point, while the S&P 500 is largely flat. This kind of performance from the major indices makes sense, given how much stocks rallied in the final months of 2023. However, there a still several stocks to sell for the long run. Below are three of my suggestions.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) share price, despite may prior warnings, ended 2023 okay, rising 35%, beating the S&P 500 but trailing the Nasdaq. For those who don’t know, Qualcomm specializes in wireless technology and other semiconductor products. Majority of the Android phones, for example, not only use a Qualcomm modem for wireless purposes but they also employ the power of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon system-on-a-chip (SoC).\n\nHowever, developments in one of its biggest markets, China, should keep long-term investors away from QCOM. In early September, Huawei – China’s telecom, cloud, and consumer electronics champion – quietly released the Huawei Mate 60 Pro, which features a 7-nanometer system on a chip (SoC) designed and manufactured in China. Moreover, the wireless modem on the Huawei Mate 60 Pro also reached fast 5G speeds. This event, in and of itself, should worry any Qualcomm investor. This makes it one of those stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQCOM’s long-term share potential is definitely in jeopardy. Chinese smartphone makers make a significant percentage of global handset sales, and as China’s semiconductor industry becomes more competitive, these smartphone manufacturers are likely to rely on locally produced semiconductor products, ultimately putting at risk Qualcomm’s business and future prospects.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of the most successful companies in the world, dominating the smartphone and tablet markets for more than decade. Not surprisingly, the iPhone maker’s stock had a good run in 2023, increasing nearly 50%. However, recent challenges have cast doubt on the company’s future growth prospects. Despite new iPhone and iPad releases, Apple’s revenue growth remained unchanged, disappointing investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe mobile handset market is at capacity. Consumer demand for smartphones is decreasing as they lose novelty with each iteration. Another reason investors should be wary of AAPL stock is the uncertainty of the China market, which accounted for about 19% of Apple’s revenue at the end of its fiscal year 2023. China is a highly competitive and volatile market.\n\nHuawei’s launch of the Mate 60 Pro, with a 7nm SoC, led many Chinese consumers to favor it over the new iPhone amidst geopolitical tensions. According to a report by Bloomberg in late November, Apple’s iPhone 15 sales were still behind the predecessor, largely due to the resurgence of Huawei’s flagship device. Unless Apple pursues a broad and competent diversification strategy, investors should not hope for strong share price appreciation. All in all, it’s one of those stocks to sell.\n\nHerbalife (HLF) Healthy food including salmon, almonds, garlic, broccoli, avocado, and lettuce\n\nHerbalife (NYSE:HLF) is a global nutrition company providing health and wellness products, including protein bars and shakes, to some 95 markets worldwide. The company made one of my ‘sell’ lists last year and as consumers are still price conscious due to inflation, I think Herbalife deserves another entry.\n\nFor those unaware, Herbalife primarily sells its products through two sales channels, direct selling and distributors. While many would perceive the success of the former as highly dependent on marketing spend and the brand’s image, the company contends that through the direct selling sales channel, customers can get proper support, coaching, and education.\n\nDespite selling healthy products to a growing base of customers, Herbalife struggled in 2022 and those struggles continued into 2023. In particular, Herbalife saw its revenue decline by more than 10% year-over-year (YOY) in 2022. Moreover, revenue in Herbalife’s first, second and third fiscal quarter reports declined on a YOY basis.\n\nAs inflation remains elevated and the economy begins to slow down, it’s likely Herbalife continues to feel consumer pullback in the next couple of quarters. A hotter-than-expected December CPI report also clouds Herbalife’s future goals. Shares are down more than 17% YTD, and I suggest investors get out now before things get even worse.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Apple has promised to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals, the European Union said Friday, as the U.S. tech company seeks to resolve an antitrust case and avoid a fine that potentially could be worth billions.\n\nApple proposed letting third-party mobile wallet and payment service providers access the contactless payment function on its iOS operating system, the EU said. The 27-nation bloc now is seeking feedback from “all interested parties\" on the changes before making a decision on the case.\n\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, accused Apple in 2022 of abusing its dominant position by limiting access to its mobile payment technology.\n\nBrussels has been using antitrust cases and new digital laws to rein in the power of Apple and other tech giants and protect consumers.\n\nThe commission alleged that Apple was restricting competition by blocking developers of rival mobile wallet apps from accessing the near-field communication, or NFC, technology used by its Apple Pay system. That prevents those developers from offering competing services on Apple devices, the EU said.\n\nBreaches of EU competition law can draw fines worth up to 10% of a company's annual global revenue, which in Apple's case, could amount to tens of billions of euros (dollars).\n\nThe changes Apple is proposing to ease EU antitrust concerns would last for a decade and apply to rival mobile wallet makers as well as iOS users in the bloc's 27 countries, plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, the commission said.\n\nApple said that through “ongoing discussions” with the commission, it offered to provide developers of payment, banking and digital wallet apps with an option for their users to “make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.”",

        "content": "(Adds reaction from one of complainants in the case in paragraphs 8-9)\n\nBRUSSELS, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The European Commission is seeking feedback from rivals and customers on concessions Apple offered to settle EU antitrust charges and stave off a possible hefty fine, it said on Friday, confirming an earlier Reuters report.\n\nThe bloc's regulator had charged Apple with restricting access to its tap-and-go mobile payment systems, based on the independent technology called Near-Field Communication (NFC), as it made it difficult for rivals to develop alterative payment options for iOS-based devices and compete with Apple Pay and Wallet apps.\n\nTo address that, Apple committed to open up these systems to third-party developers for their own apps, which would work independently from the Apple ones.\n\n\"We have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet,\" Apple said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe access is offered to developers of payments, banking, and digital wallet apps in the European Economic Area (EEA) as another option, on top of Apple Pay, the iPhone maker said.\n\nThis would enable consumers to select whether they want to pay with Apple's own service or another NFC-enabled application through their bank or card issuer, Apple added.\n\nThe Commission specified that the use of these apps for payments in stores outside the EEA would be possible.\n\n\"If Apple keeps their promise, this is a real game changer for mobile wallets,\" Nordic wallet company Vipps MobilePay, one of the complainants in the case, said in a statement.\n\n\"We are super optimistic and positive to Apple's proposed commitments, but we will save the real celebration to when we see Apple fulfilling the commitments without hindrances and extra costs for developers,\" Vipps MobilePay chief executive Rune Garborg said.\n\nStory continues\n\nCommitments also include additional features and functions, such as defaulting to preferred payment apps or access to authentication features such as FaceID.\n\nRivals and customers have one month from the publication of the summary to come back with feedback.\n\nOnce approved, the implementation of these commitments will be monitored by a trustee, who will report to the Commission.

        "content": "Spotify has launched a fresh attack on Apple as part of the pair's long-standing battle over Apple's App Store rules and fees, calling new charges on purchases made outside the App Store “outrageous.”\n\nApple announced Wednesday it would permit users in the U.S. to make purchases outside its App Store, provided major app developers pay a 27% commission.\n\nThe changes come after the tech group faced a legal challenge from Fortnite maker Epic Games as part of a battle over fees spanning back to 2010.\n\nWhile the judge sided with Apple on most counts, they ruled the company was in violation of a competition law by failing to tell users about ways to make purchases outside the App Store.\n\nUnder the change, developers can now redirect customers to bypass the App Store payment system by using things like external links.\n\nApple is now chasing Epic Games for $73.5 million to cover losses and legal costs following its win, according to a Tuesday filing.\n\nWhile the biggest app developers, including Spotify, will face a 27% fee on purchases made away from the store, sales from smaller developers and the auto-renewal of subscriptions will face a 12% charge.\n\nIn a vitriolic statement, Spotify argued the latest charge \"flies in the face\" of attempts by the U.S. to introduce more competition to the tech sector.\n\nA representative for Apple didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nApple’s fees back in spotlight\n\nMajor developers selling digital goods and services on Apple’s App Store pay the group a 30% commission fee on apps and in-app purchases, including subscriptions.\n\nHowever, small developers pay about a 15% commission, while 85% of developers pay no fees at all.\n\n“All App Store developers—including those who place buttons or links with calls to action in their apps — benefit from Apple’s proprietary technology and tools protected by intellectual property, and access to its user base,” Apple said as it disclosed the changes in a court filing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new fee for external purchases, though, has sparked Spotify’s latest missive against Apple, extending a long-running tussle with the group over what the streaming platform views as anti-competitive charges.\n\n“Once again, Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly,” a representative for the group told Fortune in a statement.\n\n“Their latest move in the U.S.—imposing a 27% fee for transactions made outside of an app on a developer’s website—is outrageous and flies in the face of the court’s efforts to enable greater competition and user choice.”\n\nSpotify called for the U.K. government to step in to prevent similar fees passing in the country. The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill, which would impose tough new rules on major tech players, is currently passing through the country’s houses of parliament.\n\nSpotify’s fight with Apple\n\nSpotify and the group’s CEO Daniel Ek have repeatadly lamented Apple’s charges, which fall on any subscriptions to the streaming platform made through the app store.\n\nThe group views the charges as giving Apple a leg-up with its own music streaming offering, Apple Music, which is less popular than Spotify.\n\nIn an October op-ed for the Daily Mail, Ek said the charge, which Google’s app store also levies, hobbled competition and allowed the groups monopolistic control in the tech sector.\n\nEk argued that he wouldn’t have been to create his $40 billion streaming platform if he had come up with the idea today, owing to those fees.\n\n“Today, Apple and Google are not just players, they are the rule-makers and gatekeepers of the mobile internet, controlling how more than 5 billion global consumers interact online,” Ek wrote.\n\nThe European Commission launched an antitrust investigation into Apple in 2020 after Spotify made complaints about the 30% fee it pays the company.\n\nIn February, the EU narrowed its this investigation to exclude Spotify’s request to remove the charge from the sale of digital goods and services.\n\n“The App Store has helped Spotify become the top music streaming service across Europe, and we hope the European Commission will end its pursuit of a complaint that has no merit,” a representative for Apple previously told Fortune in a statement.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Hey, Pal! Don’t Even THINK About Investing in PYPL Stock.",
        "content": "The payments-processing space has become increasingly crowded in the 2020s. Along with that, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has the additional challenge of transitioning a new CEO and a new chief financial officer (CFO) into those roles at the company. Thus, I view PYPL stock as a “sell” as PayPal’s comeback is far from assured. And, if it happens at all, might take a very long time.\n\nMaking matters worse, PayPal just got downgraded by an analyst who issued an important warning for prospective investors. So, we’ll definitely address the major problems that should convince prudent traders to avoid PayPal stock.\n\nPayPal’s ‘Generational Problem’\n\nIt’s always interesting when a bullish analyst gives us a bearish idea. In particular, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev is generally bullish on PYPL stock, but he recently acknowledged that PayPal “has a generational problem.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe next time you see a PayPal button on the checkout page of an online store, consider this. PayPal’s global share of the U.S. payments market (according to Barron’s) is just 8%. And remember, the PayPal brand has to compete with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has almost universal name recognition among young consumers.\n\nSure, PayPal also owns the Venmo brand. But then, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is dropping Venmo as a payment processing option at checkout. These are issues that eager PayPal stock investors ought to consider. PayPal will have to overcome its brand’s “generational problem” and somehow take market share from Apple Pay and other rival brands. That’s much easier said than done.\n\nAre PYPL Stock Investors Willing to Wait Years for a Turnaround?\n\nThe company might actually stage a turnaround at some point. It’s a gamble to bet on this happening, though. Besides, even if there’s an eventual comeback for PayPal, the share price could stagnate for a while.\n\nBTIG analysts Andrew Harte and Thomas Smith are evidently trying to warn prospective investors about this. “We see the process of returning the company to consistent and profitable revenue growth as a multiyear initiative, rather than a FY24 story,” they wrote about PayPal. That’s a bitter pill to swallow if you own PYPL stock and hoped to enjoy robust returns this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts with Oppenheimer reinforced the BTIG analysts’ warning about PayPal’s long-term challenges. They stated, “The issue at hand is the duration of time before PYPL can stabilize operating margins without cutting expenses year over year.” Then they added, “This duration is likely counted in years.”\n\nWith that in mind, the BTIG analysts downgraded PayPal stock from “buy” to “neutral.” Meanwhile, the Oppenheimer analysts lowered their rating on PayPal shares from “outperform” to “perform.” So clearly, there are Wall Street experts out there who aren’t particularly enthusiastic about PayPal’s near-term prospects.\n\nMinimize Your Exposure to PayPal Stock\n\nYou don’t need to panic-sell PayPal stock right now. The idea here is just to consider the potentially lengthy time frame for PayPal’s turnaround.\n\nBearing that in mind, investors might choose to minimize their exposure to PYPL stock. It will take at least a few more quarters to see what PayPal’s new CEO and CFO can really do. Therefore, unless some highly positive catalysts emerge soon, I’m not prepared to confidently recommend an investment in PayPal.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

        "title": "Remember Motorola? Its Chinese owner wants it to be the world’s third-largest mobile brand by 2027",
        "content": "Motorola once led the mobile phone market, with its chic flip phones like the Motorola Razr. But, like many of its contemporaries, the phonemaker lost out to smartphones from companies like Apple, Samsung, and a host of Chinese brands. Now the Chinese tech company Lenovo, which bought Motorola from Google in 2014, thinks the brand is prime for a big comeback.\n\n“I would bet a paycheck that in three years we will be number three around the world,” Matthew Zielinski, executive vice-president for Lenovo, told CNBCat the World Economic Forum in Davos. Lenovo has \"hyper-prioritized\" Motorola, a decision that's now paying off, he said.\n\nCurrently, the top two brands in the smartphone market are Apple and Samsung; a recent report from market intelligence firm IDC gives them 20.1% and 19.4% market share respectively. Two Chinese brands, Xiaomi and Oppo, come in third and fourth place respectively.\n\nCounterpoint Research, another market intelligence firm, puts Samsung in first place with 20% market share, based on data up to the third quarter of 2023. Apple comes in second with 16%, followed by Oppo and Xiaomi.\n\nWhile the firm doesn't list Motorola in the top five, it does note the brand reported double-digit growth last year. And Motorola may be doing well in individual markets, coming in second in Latin America, according to publicly available data from Canalys and Counterpoint. The brand is in third in the U.S., according to Counterpoint.\n\nWhat happened to Motorola?\n\nMotorola's market share peaked in 2006, when IDC put it at second place behind Nokia. That was the year before the launch of the iPhone, and since then the company has lost ground to Apple and Samsung. Critics point to Motorola's slow reaction to changing consumer needs, whether turning the phone to a business device like the Blackberry, or the rise of smartphone apps.\n\nMotorola then split into two companies in 2010: Motorola Mobility, which housed the company's consumer electronics division, and Motorola Solutions, which makes telecommunications equipment. (Motorola Solutions has managed to turn things around under CEO Greg Brown due, in part, to a brisk business in public safety technology)\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle bought Motorola for $12.5 billion in August 2011, only to offload the company to Lenovo three years later for just $2.9 billion.\n\nThe current-day Motorola is now banking on foldable smartphones, bringing back its Razr brand. The latest version of the RAZR costs less than $1000, making it cheaper that Samsung's foldable offering.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Meet the Stock Warren Buffett Has Purchased Shares of Almost Every Month for More Than 5 Years",
        "content": "For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been dazzling Wall Street with his investing prowess. Since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha, as he's best known, has overseen a greater than 4,450,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A Shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on January 12.\n\nWarren Buffett has a knack for picking long-term winners, and investors of all walks usually wait on the edge of their respective seats to see what he and his investment team have been buying and selling. The funny thing is, Buffett's most commonly purchased stock isn't the one you might initially think it is. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett and his team have been adding to a handful of brand-name stocks with frequency\n\nThe good news for curious investors is that Berkshire Hathaway is required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 45 days following the end of each quarter. A 13F provides an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the previous quarter and is a required filing for persons and entities with at least $100 million in assets under management.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Jan. 12, Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio had $361 billion of invested assets spread across roughly 50 stocks. Some of these stocks have been added to with frequency in recent years.\n\nEnergy stockOccidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) is the perfect example of a now-core holding that's had the undivided attention of the Oracle of Omaha and his \"investing lieutenants,\" Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, over the past two years.\n\nWhen 2022 began, Berkshire Hathaway held $10 billion in Occidental preferred stock yielding 8% annually. However, it held no common shares. As of this past week, Buffett's company owned a little over 243.7 million shares of Occidental Petroleum common stock, representing a greater than $14.1 billion stake.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reason Buffett and his investing aides have purchased shares of Occidental with frequency over the past two years likely has to do with the expectation that the spot price for crude oil will remain elevated or head even higher. Multiple years of capital underinvestment by global energy majors during the pandemic, coupled with uncertainty tied to Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine, has led to a tight global supply of crude oil. Generally speaking, when the supply of a key commodity is constrained, it's not unusual for the spot price of that commodity to increase.\n\nOccidental Petroleum is unique among integrated oil and gas operators in that it generates a disproportionate percentage of its revenue from its upstream (i.e., drilling) operations. If the price of crude oil rises, Occidental will enjoy an outsized benefit. Of course, the opposite of this scenario (a decline in the spot price of crude oil) is true, as well.\n\nWarren Buffett has also not been shy about increasing his company's position in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Since Berkshire's initial stake in Apple was opened during the first quarter of 2016, it's grown to almost 915.6 million shares and accounts for 47.1% ($170.2 billion) of invested assets.\n\nConsidering that Buffett referred to Apple as \"a better business than any we own\" during Berkshire's 2023 annual shareholder meeting, it shouldn't surprise anyone that he and his team have been building this position for years. Apple brings brand power and innovative consistency to the table that few other businesses can match.\n\nFor instance, Apple has been absolutely dominant in the U.S. smartphone market for well over a decade. Since introducing a 5G-capable iPhone in the fourth quarter of 2020, the company has consistently accounted for a little over half of U.S. smartphone market share.\n\nApple is also evolving into a platforms company. Placing added emphasis on subscription services is a way to boost long-term margins, minimize sales fluctuations during major iPhone upgrade cycles, and keep customers loyal to its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nThere's also nothing quite like Apple's capital-return program. Apple is returning $15 billion in dividends to its shareholders each year and has repurchased more than $600 billion of its common stock since kicking off its buyback program in 2013. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWarren Buffett has bought shares of this stock on a nearly monthly basis for over five years\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's 13F is an invaluable tool that helps investors get a read on what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Warren Buffett and his lieutenants. However, it doesn't tell the full story -- at least with regard to Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy.\n\nThough there are a couple of core holdings in Berkshire's portfolio that have been purchased with frequency in recent years, there's another stock you'll find listed toward the end of Berkshire's quarterly reports that's been purchased by Warren Buffett on an almost monthly basis, dating back to July 2018. The reason you're not going to find this stock listed on the company's 13F is because Buffett's favorite stock to buy is his own company, Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nAs of the midpoint of 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's share repurchase program required the company's stock to trade at or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above book value) for buybacks to take place. For many years leading up to July 2018, Berkshire's stock never fell to this line-in-the-sand threshold -- which meant not a cent was spent on repurchases.\n\nEverything changed on July 17, 2018. The company's board passed new measures that allowed Warren Buffett and his late right-hand man Charlie Munger more freedom to pull the trigger on buybacks when they saw fit. As long as Berkshire Hathaway had at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on its balance sheet, and Buffett and Munger agreed that their own company's stock was intrinsically cheap, repurchases could be conducted without any cap.\n\nSince Berkshire Hathaway's board made this change -- Berkshire hasn't reported its fourth-quarter results yet, which is why I'm stating this figure through Sept. 30, 2023 -- Buffett and Munger OK'd share buybacks in all 21 quarters. In fact, there have only been a handful of months over the past five-plus years where share repurchases didn't take place. In aggregate, Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger oversaw the repurchase of more than $72 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock since mid-2018.\n\nShare buybacks are the direct way Warren Buffett and his team reward long-term shareholders. Since Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, regularly buying back stock can steadily increase the ownership stakes of longtime shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, companies with steady or growing net income, like Berkshire Hathaway (sans the recognition of unrealized investment gains and losses), should see their earnings per share climb as the number of outstanding shares decline. This helps to make Berkshire's stock even more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nIn 2024, there's no stock I'm more confident we'll see Warren Buffett buy than his own company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures tick higher, pointing to an extension in gains posted in the prior session. Elsewhere, the U.S. Congress passes a bill providing short-term funding to the federal government, while department store chain Macy's (NYSE:M) reportedly plans to axe thousands of jobs and close some locations.\n\n1. U.S. futures move higher\n\nU.S. stock futures edged into the green on Friday.\n\nBy 05:16 ET (10:16 GMT), the Dow futures contract had risen by 73 points or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures had gained 18 points or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 114 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe major averages on Wall Street surged on Thursday, boosted in part by the largest one-day jump in shares of iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in eight months. TSMC's U.S.-listed shares spiked as well after the chipmaker said soaring demand for artificial intelligence will power a more than 20% rise in 2024 revenue.\n\nStrong U.S. labor market data also bolstered confidence that the world's largest economy was on track for a so-called \"soft landing\" -- a scenario in which inflation is cooled without sparking a downturn in activity. These hopes helped brighten sentiment, which had been dampened recently by waning expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon move to bring interest rates down from more than two-decade highs.\n\n2. Existing home sales ahead\n\nMarkets will have the chance to sift through fresh housing market data on Friday that could provide a glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer.\n\nExisting home sales are expected to have risen by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in December when compared to prior month, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists. Over the entire year, the measure is seen dipping to its lowest level since 2008.\n\nMortgage rates in the U.S. were elevated throughout much of 2023, persuading many buyers to shy away from purchasing residential properties. Meanwhile, the higher mortgage rates also convinced many current homeowners to stay put, denting the housing supply and limiting declines in home prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut mortgage rates, which touched a 23-year high in October, have showed signs of cooling. On Thursday, Freddie Mac reported that the average fixed-rate 30-year mortgage dropped to its lowest mark since last May this week.\n\n\"This is an encouraging development for the housing market and in particular first-time homebuyers who are sensitive to changes in housing affordability,\" said Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater in a statement. \"However, as purchase demand continues to thaw, it will put more pressure on already depleted inventory for sale.\"\n\n3. U.S. Congress passes short-term funding bill\n\nCongressional lawmakers have given the go-ahead to a bill that will keep the federal government in business until March, although looming policy fights still remain over issues like the war in Ukraine and U.S. border security.\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved the measure in a 77-18 vote, while the House approved it 314-108. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden's desk for signing.\n\nA replay of recent short-term funding extensions, Thursday's resolution will provide the funding necessary to operate several key departments until March 1 and the rest of the government until March 8. They were due to run out of cash on Jan. 19 and Feb. 2, respectively.\n\nBut leaders on Capitol Hill still face the task of securing funding for an almost $1.7 trillion U.S. spending deal forged earlier this month. The details have yet to be determined, with the Biden administration and Democrats potentially needing to agree to more funding to help curb immigration at the southern U.S. border in order to secure Republican backing for military aid to Ukraine.\n\n4. Macy's to slash jobs, close stores - reports\n\nMacy's is set to reduce headcount and shutter locations in a bid to cut costs and streamline its business, according to media reports.\n\nThe U.S. department chain will slash 2,350 roles -- amounting to 3.5% of its workforce -- and close five stores. Macy's employed 94,570 full- and part-time employees and operated 722 store locations as of January 2023.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report on the plans, said that Macy's is aiming to further automate its supply chain and outsource some jobs. In a memo to employees cited by the WSJ, the company said the layoffs would happen on Jan. 26.\n\nMacy's is facing heavy pressure from activist investors, who have reportedly set their sights on a $5.8 billion buyout of the owner of Bloomingdale's stores and Bluemercury beauty shops. The firm, which is also in the midst of a leadership change, has yet to respond publicly to the activists.\n\n5.

        "title": "Apple to Get First Taste of Consumer Demand for $3,499 Vision Pro",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will finally be available for preorders on Friday, giving the company its first real taste of consumer demand for the $3,499 device.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down YouTube and Spotify Won’t Launch Apple Vision Pro Apps, Joining Netflix Pakistan’s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Trump Asks Supreme Court to Keep Him on Colorado Ballot\n\nThe product goes on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time via Apple’s website and mobile app — ahead of the Vision Pro getting delivered to stores and consumers on Feb. 2. The purchasing process will be unique. Customers will need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription.\n\nThough Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products, the preorder process could provide some hints. If shoppers are quoted delivery times well beyond Feb. 2, it may suggest that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.\n\nWall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”\n\nRead More: Apple Headset Lacks Blockbuster Buzz Needed to Energize Shares\n\nStill, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.\n\nIn the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nInitially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nIt’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.\n\nInside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nThe Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.\n\nAnd the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.\n\nAnother concern that’s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.\n\nBut Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they’ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls “spatial computing.”\n\nTo commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.\n\nA key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn’t have a closed-in feel — a complaint with VR headsets.\n\n“From the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,” he said. “It really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.”\n\nThat led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer’s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. “It was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,” Rockwell said.\n\nApple also developed an interface that doesn’t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.\n\nOne of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they’re in the same place.\n\n“It’s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,” Rockwell said. “It changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "title": "TSMC Outlook Drives $165 Billion Chip Rally in 2024 Rebound Bet",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor stocks from Tokyo Electron Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. gained more than $160 billion of market value after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s outlook for capital spending and revenue lifted hopes of a broad tech recovery in 2024.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Pakistan’s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Nasdaq 100 Hits Record High in Tech-Fueled Rebound: Markets Wrap\n\nTSMC’s better-than-projected numbers underscored expectations for a bounce-back in smartphone, chip and computing demand, following more than a year of post-Covid malaise. On Friday, the world’s most valuable chipmaker gained more than 6% in Taipei — its biggest gain in almost a year — after a near-10% climb in the US. Key suppliers Tokyo Electron and Advantest Corp. gained more than 5% in Tokyo. Together, they fueled a gain in semiconductor stocks from the US to Asia of roughly $165 billion, based on Bloomberg’s calculations.\n\nTSMC’s outlook offered much-needed reassurance to investors accustomed to a depressed market. The main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia is budgeting capital expenditure of $28 billion to $32 billion and expecting revenue growth to return to at least 20% for the year. Executives also spent a lot of time talking about how the advent of AI should turbocharge the industry because of its immense computing needs.\n\nIn Europe, chip gear linchpin ASML Holding NV gained 4%, leading a broad regional rally that spilled over into US stocks including Nvidia and Intel Corp., driving the biggest gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index since Dec. 11.\n\n“TSMC’s confidence around near-term fundamentals appears to have improved significantly over the past 4 to 5 months,” Wedbush analysts wrote. “We see this more bullish outlook as predicated upon some combination of optimism around a growing contribution from AI, better expectations for traditional end market trends in 2024.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC Gains as Outlook Points to AI-Fueled Growth: Street Wrap\n\nSigns of a recovery for the chipmaking sector have emerged in recent weeks. The Semiconductor Industry Association estimated chip sales increased in November after more than a year of declines. TSMC is projecting revenue growth of at least 8% to $18 billion to $18.8 billion in the March quarter, versus expectations for around $18.2 billion.\n\nIt’s now moving ahead with plans for chipmaking plants in Japan, Arizona and Germany — the first of which will begin mass production at the end of 2024 in a big boost to TSMC’s global footprint.\n\nRead More: TSMC’s Outlook Backs Hopes for Global Tech Recovery in 2024\n\nUncertainty persists. This month, fellow chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co. posted its sixth successive quarter of declining operating profit, as it weathered the impact of muted consumer demand in its own smartphone and memory businesses.\n\nQuestions also overshadow China, the world’s largest computing, smartphone, internet and chip market.\n\nApple — long one of TSMC’s most important customers — faced headwinds with its latest iPhone generation. Several analysts downgraded Apple on expectations of soft demand, and Jefferies has said the iPhone sales slump in China is likely to deepen. The US company has also been hit by a widening ban on foreign-device use among Chinese agencies and state-owned companies.\n\nTSMC Gain in Sales Not Enough to Boost Margins: Earnings Outlook\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., which is poised to launch its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Feb. 2, is already envisioning future workplace applications for the device, including using it for surgery, aircraft repair and teaching students.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Pakistan’s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Nasdaq 100 Hits Record High in Tech-Fueled Rebound: Markets Wrap\n\nIn a video sent to employees this week, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the product’s development, as well as potential growth areas for the still-nascent technology. Bloomberg News obtained a transcript of the conversation, which came just before Apple began accepting preorders for the Vision Pro on Friday.\n\nWhen asked about some “cool” ways that people could use the $3,499 Vision Pro, Rockwell cited health care, training and education as key areas.\n\n“Oftentimes, surgeons struggle to look at displays during procedures, where information is spread out,” said Rockwell, the vice president in charge of the device. “Apple Vision Pro could bring all of that together and hopefully improve patient outcomes.”\n\nSeparately, the company told employees in a memo Thursday that they’ll be eligible for a 25% discount on the Vision Pro. That’s less than the 50% markdown that Apple offered when the company launched its smartwatch and HomePod smart speaker — though those products didn’t have as high a price tag. It would take the cost down to about $2,600, excluding taxes and options.\n\nEmployees also get $500 to spend on a Mac every three years, a credit they’ll be able to apply to the headset. And Apple will reimburse the cost of prescription lenses for the product, according to the memo, which was seen by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company has marketed the Vision Pro as a consumer device for gaming, video and communication. But Apple is looking for ways to broaden its appeal. Technicians or aircraft mechanics could use it to get “high-quality training in ways they’ve never been able to experience before,” Rockwell said.\n\nStory continues\n\nRockwell added that he’s “very excited about what we can do in learning and education because it is another superpower of Apple Vision Pro.”\n\nApple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwo of Rockwell’s lieutenants — Dave Scott and Yaniv Gur — are investigating new applications for the Vision Pro. Scott was previously an executive on Apple’s car team before briefly leaving to run a mobile MRI machine company. He’s now in charge of finding ways for enterprises to use the headset. Gur, who used to run engineering for Apple’s productivity apps, is overseeing potential education opportunities for the device.\n\nApple is betting that mixed reality — the melding of virtual and augmented reality — will eventually become a major source of revenue. But the hefty price will make it harder to win over consumers.\n\nSuccess of the Vision Pro also will hinge on third-party developers. Though Apple has lined up content from many big entertainment providers, including Walt Disney Co., others have balked at supporting the new device.\n\nNetflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube don’t plan to offer Vision Pro apps for their services, forcing users to see their content through the device’s web browser — a less immersive experience.\n\nRead More: YouTube, Spotify Follow Netflix in Snubbing Apple’s Vision Pro\n\nApple hopes the headset’s groundbreaking technology will help win converts.\n\n“We strived to make a product that was a tool, not a toy,” Rockwell said. “To make a product for productivity or high-end entertainment, displays had to be exceptional, so we invested a lot in creating a new, uncompromising high-resolution display system.”\n\n(Updates with more on Vision Pro plans starting in 10th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "Apple plans to sell its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches without blood oxygen sensors after a federal court denied its bid to continue sales while it appeals an import ban imposed on those watches due to a patent infringement dispute with medical monitoring technology firm Masimo.\n\nLast year, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) ruled that Apple’s blood oxygen sensors in those two smartwatches violated Masimo’s patents. The USITC imposed an import ban that briefly went into effect before it was temporarily halted during the tech giant’s appeal before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and while it sought approval for redesigned Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches.\n\nMasimo noted in a court filing this week that U.S. Customs and Border Protection approved Apple Watches that were redesigned to exclude a blood oxygen sensor feature. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday denied Apple’s request to put the ban on hold during the appeal, meaning the company had to stop selling the smartwatches at the center of the dispute unless the blood oxygen sensor was removed.\n\n\"Apple’s appeal is ongoing, and we believe the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit should reverse the USITC’s decision,\" the company said in a statement provided to FOX Business. \"We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting orders.\"\n\nCOURT REINSTATES IMPORT BAN ON CERTAIN APPLE WATCHES AMID PATENT DISPUTE Apple is to refrain from selling Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 devices with blood oxygen sensors while it appeals the ITC's ruling.\n\n\"Pending the appeal, Apple is taking steps to comply with the ruling while ensuring customers have access to Apple Watch with limited disruption. These steps include introducing a version of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the United States without the Blood Oxygen feature. There is no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the Blood Oxygen feature,\" Apple explained.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nApple noted that the redesigned Apple Watches became available from the company’s retail website starting at 6 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, and its retail stores also began selling them on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCustomers who buy the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 will still see the blood oxygen icon on the watch, but when tapped they will receive a message saying, \"The Blood Oxygen app is no longer available. Learn More in the Health app on your iPhone.\" When users tap through to the Health app, users will see \"unavailable\" for Blood Oxygen and a link to a support article, Apple explained.\n\nAPPLE BOARD MEMBERS AL GORE, JAMES BELL TO RETIRE Apple is to sell its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches without blood oxygen sensors following the federal appellate court's ruling.\n\n\"The Federal Circuit’s decision to lift the temporary stay is a victory for the integrity of the American patent system and the safety of people relying on pulse oximetry,\" said Joe Kiani, founder and CEO of Masimo, in a statement provided to FOX Business.\n\n\"It affirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American investors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others’ patents,\" Kiani added. Apple Watch Series 9 smartwatches are displayed.\n\nSeries 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches that were purchased before the restriction on the blood oxygen sensor technology was put in place are unaffected by the ban, and other Apple Watch products are similarly not affected.\n\nThe two smartwatches at the center of the dispute remain available for sale with the blood oxygen sensor to customers outside the U.S., where the U.S. International Trade Commission doesn’t have jurisdiction.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple Watches go on sale without blood oxygen sensor amid patent dispute",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Google’s YouTube and Spotify Technology SA, the world’s most popular video and music services, are joining Netflix Inc. in steering clear of Apple Inc.’s upcoming mixed-reality headset.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Pakistan’s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Nasdaq 100 Hits Record High in Tech-Fueled Rebound: Markets Wrap\n\nYouTube said in a statement Thursday that it isn’t planning to launch a new app for the Apple Vision Pro, nor will it allow its longstanding iPad application to work on the device. YouTube, like Netflix, is recommending that customers use a web browser if they want to see its content: “YouTube users will be able to use YouTube in Safari on the Vision Pro at launch.”\n\nSpotify also isn’t planning a new app for visionOS — the Vision Pro’s operating system — and doesn’t expect to enable its iPad app to run on the device, according to a person familiar with matter. But the music service will still likely work from a web browser. Bloomberg News reported on Netflix’s decision Wednesday.\n\nThe Vision Pro will include access to Apple’s apps for music and podcasts, which compete with Spotify’s offerings. But getting snubbed by Netflix, Spotify and YouTube means that the most popular streaming apps won’t be available when the headset launches on Feb. 2. Apple has largely marketed the device as a platform for video, games and other entertainment.\n\nYouTube is a particularly large omission for the product. When Apple’s original iPad launched in 2010, YouTube was one of a handful of apps preinstalled on the tablet.\n\nYouTube and Spotify continue to offer popular apps for the iPhone and iPad. And that, theoretically, gave them an easy path toward supporting the Vision Pro. Developers with iPad software in the regular App Store will see those apps appear in the Vision Pro store by default. That means developers have to opt out if they don’t want to participate.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral other entertainment apps are still participating, including Disney+, Max, Peacock, ESPN and Amazon Prime Video. Altogether, Apple says the device will support more than 1 million titles in the headset’s App Store. The company will begin taking preorders for the Vision Pro on Friday.\n\nYouTube and Spotify declined to say why they bowed out of supporting the $3,499 device. Spotify doesn’t offer an app on competing headsets, such as Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest, though YouTube does. Spotify also has been embroiled in a fight with Apple over App Store policies, but the decision on the Vision Pro isn’t related to that, according to the person familiar, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.\n\nSearches conducted by MacStories on Thursday indicated that other key iPad apps, including Meta’s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, aren’t currently set to work on the Vision Pro either. But that could change by the device’s launch, or those developers could be planning new dedicated versions for visionOS. Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n—With assistance from Julia Love and Kurt Wagner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Masimo Corp. Chief Executive Officer Joe Kiani, waging a legal fight with Apple Inc. over a blood oxygen feature, said that consumers are better off without the iPhone maker’s version of the technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Pakistan’s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Dimon Says China Risk-Reward Equation Has ‘Changed Dramatically’\n\nThe remarks followed Apple’s decision to cease sales of smartwatches Thursday that had the tool — a gauge of blood oxygen saturation known as a pulse oximeter — which had been a heavily marketed health feature on the devices. The move stemmed from a ruling by the US International Trade Commission that found the technology violated Masimo patents.\n\nCustomers should buy pulse oximeters from Masimo or others instead, Kiani said in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg TV. “Apple is masquerading what they are offering to consumers as a reliable, medical pulse oximeter, even though it is not,” he said. “I really feel wholeheartedly that consumers are better off without it.”\n\nApple didn’t have an immediate comment on Kiani’s remarks. After a US federal appeals court denied Apple a reprieve, the company began selling tweaked versions of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches Thursday without the blood oxygen feature. Apple said it strongly disagrees with the court’s decision and is appealing the ITC ban.\n\nUnlike Apple’s implementation of blood oxygen sensing, Masimo’s offering has been approved by the US Federal Drug Administration, Kiani said. He criticized the Apple feature for just taking two measurements a day and claimed the company only released the tool during the Covid pandemic to take market share from Fitbit, now part of Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\n“Pulse oximetry is not useful unless it is a continuous monitor,” Kiani said. “That happens during sleep. During sleep, you could have a desaturation that might be related to apnea. You can have a dangerous desaturation to opioid pain relief you might have taken. That is where the value comes.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Masimo CEO Open to Settling Apple Rift But ‘They Haven’t Called’\n\nMasimo’s CEO said he hasn’t spoken to Apple personally about a settlement, and that nobody from Apple has reached out about coming to an agreement.\n\n“There are court-ordered mediations that I cannot get into that have been held before,” he said. “And there will be additional meetings probably in the future.”\n\nKiani added that he doesn’t consider those meetings to be steps toward settling litigation.\n\nThe executive also criticized the idea that his company is throwing everything it can at Apple to see what sticks, saying that none of his company’s patents have been invalidated.\n\nApple is living in a “fake reality,” he said. “This narrative is false.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "title": "Tech shows it's key to bringing market out of tough start to 2024",
        "content": "The key drivers of the late 2023 stock market rally have faded.\n\nWith investors increasingly questioning when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, the so-called \"soft landing\" trade which saw investors pour into interest-rate sensitive sectors has stumbled to start 2024.\n\nThat raises the question of what the next catalyst is — and investors may not need to look further than the tech sector (XLK). Despite the recent craze over small caps and other hot trades that could benefit from Fed's interest rate cuts, technology earnings over the next few weeks will still be key to bringing the market out of its January slump.\n\nTo Keith Lerner, the co-CIO at Truist, it's a simple math equation. With the tech sector representing nearly 30% of the S&P 500, by far the largest portion of any the eleven sectors, and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks alone comprising nearly 30% of the index's market cap, movements in those areas remain crucial for investors in the broader indexes.\n\n\"With the concentration that you still have, I think, tech showing the earnings and the ability to grow earnings at a good pace, even if we have a step down in growth is very important to keep this market moving forward,\" Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday ahead of tech earnings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) took the lead role on Thursday as the chipmaker, which supplies to the likes of Apple (APPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported quarterly results before the opening bell that beat estimates.\n\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 came in higher than Wall Street's expectations for $1.38. And, perhaps more importantly, the chipmaker said artificial intelligence is fueling its success. Taiwan Semiconductor said it expects revenue to grow 20% in 2024 due in part to AI demand.\n\nThe news sent the semiconductor index (^SOX) nearly 3% higher while Nvidia (NVDA), whose weighting in the S&P 500 is nearly as big asthe entire energy sector, shot up over 2% before paring gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe move in semiconductors, combined with an upgrade on Apple (AAPL) stock from Bank of America, sent shares of the iPhone maker nearly 3% higher. Analyst Wamsi Mohan moved his rating to Buy from Neutral and bumped his price target to $225 from $208 citing artificial intelligence and the new Vision Pro headset as key drivers.\n\nStock moves in Apple and chips sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) up more than 1% on Thursday morning while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added more than 0.5% before comments from a Fed official on rate cuts not coming until the third quarter tempered gains.\n\nThe research from BofA marked a reversal in the recent narrative on Wall Street that's seen analysts turn bearish on Apple amid questions about iPhone demand, among other issues. And it comes at a critical point ahead of Apple's earnings release, slated for Feb. 1.\n\nOther tech giants are also expected to report in the next two weeks, beginning with Netflix on Jan. 23 and Wall Street strategists expects those reports to serve a critical juncture for the market.\n\n\"Companies have cut costs throughout the earnings recession,\" BofA equity strategist Ohsung Kwon told Yahoo Finance in early January about what could drive stocks higher. \"They have managed margins. Margins went up for the second straight quarter. So I think the momentum is to the upside and if companies talk more positively this earning season, given that the rate pressure and the macro uncertainty has eased somewhat. Now, that's going to be bullish for equities.\"\n\nFor now, technology is the sector checking those boxes and leading the averages higher with it.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "After a string of downgrades from Wall Street analysts, Apple’s (AAPL) stock received a much-needed vote of confidence on Thursday as Bank of America (BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan upgraded the bank’s position on the company and raised its price target. Shares of Apple were up nearly 3% as of midday Thursday.\n\nIn a research note, Mohan upgraded Apple from Neutral to Buy and increased its price objective from $182.68 to $225. Mohan said the company stands to benefit from a number of industry trends, as well as a glut of users who are using older iPhones and will need to upgrade to newer models in the coming years.\n\nSpecifically, Mohan says that he expects a “stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by need for the latest hardware to enable Generative AI features to be introduced in 2024/2025.” He also expects to see better growth in the company’s services business and said risks about potential legal issues Apple could face are “manageable.”\n\nApple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet: the Vision Pro headset. The first new product category for the company since it launched the Apple Watch, the $3,499 Vision Pro will serve as a test for Apple’s ability to produce a new kind of device for what could be the next generation of computing. FILE - The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after it's unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. Apple's high-priced headset for toggling between the real and digital world will be available in its stores beginning Feb. 2, 2024 launching the trendsetting company's push to broaden the appeal of what so far has been a niche technology. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn a recent hands-on with the Vision Pro, Engadget’s Dana Wollman and Cherlynn Low praised the device’s technological capabilities and fun factor, but criticized its floating keyboard. I was blown away by the Vision Pro when I first tested it out in June during Apple’s WWDC event. It’s easily the best headset out there, but the price is going to be a tough sell for the average consumer.\n\nMohan, however, says that as spatial computing takes hold, the Vision Pro could outpace Apple’s iPad revenue. The company’s iPad business generated $28.3 billion in 2023 compared to the $200.6 billion generated by iPhone sales.\n\nMohan’s upgrade follows downgrades on Apple’s stock at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic. Analysts at each of the firms pointed to slowing iPhone sales, especially in China, as a major headwind for the tech giant.\n\nStory continues\n\nGreater China is Apple’s third-largest region by revenue behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue.\n\nChina could be particularly irksome for Apple, as the company faces increased competition from homegrown tech companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. Huawei in particular has managed to regain its strength in the smartphone market after US sanctions nearly crushed the company.\n\nApple’s biggest smartphone rival, Samsung, meanwhile announced its new Galaxy S24 lineup on Wednesday. The phones, which go on sale Jan. 31 and range in price from $799 for the Galaxy S24 to $1,299 for the S24 Ultra all come with generative AI capabilities including translation functions, AI for photo editing, and more. If Apple is going to compete on an equal level with its Android counterpart, it’ll need to introduce some kind of generative AI capabilities with its next iPhone in September. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nFor now, though, it’s all about the iPhone 15 and Vision Pro.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence and penny stocks don’t necessarily go together like peanut butter and jelly, but there is some allure to AI penny stocks for risk-tolerant investors.\n\nIn 2023, companies were bending over backward to announce their AI bona fides. That trend will continue in 2024. But analysts and investors alike are becoming more selective. Specifically, they want to see AI that makes a difference and that contributes to a company’s bottom lines.\n\nThat will typically lead investors to large-cap stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, those large-cap companies come with a rich valuation. A better alternative for risk-tolerant investors may come from AI penny stocks. These are loosely defined as stocks that trade for less than $5 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe benefit of penny stocks is that investors can own a significant amount of shares for a minimal investment. And if they discover the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in their infancy, their portfolios are set.\n\nNevertheless, finding the best AI penny stocks requires as much, if not more, discernment than finding other stocks. Here are three candidates to consider in 2024.\n\n2U (TWOU) 2u education stocks\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome love it; some hate it, but online learning is here to stay. 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU) operates an online learning platform. And in May 2023, the company launched two AI-powered learning assistants build on ChatGPT. The assistants reside on the company’s edX platform.\n\nSo far, the launch isn’t making much, if any, impact on the company’s revenue and – more importantly – it’s earnings, which remain negative. This is a very small company with a market cap of just over $72 million. Micro-cap stocks such as TWOU were punished in 2023.\n\nNevertheless, the company has had the support of Cathie Wood at different times. That may be a reason that analysts remain bullish on TWOU stock. The consensus price target of $2.40 is 172% higher than the price as of the market close on January 16, 2024. The stock also gets a Strong Buy rating from one out of the seven analysts that offer a rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne more thing that speculative investors should consider is that over 90% of the company’s stock is owned by institutional investors. That’s not common for a tiny company like 2U. Do with that as you will.\n\nPredictive Oncology (POAI) A doctor points at an abstract representation of various aspects of oncology. SHPH stock\n\nSource: Oleg Ivanov IL / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most compelling possibilities for AI is in the field of drug development. Predictive Oncology (NASDAQ:POAI) intends to make that process significantly shorter. The company says it currently takes 12 years, on average, to bring a new cancer drug to market. And in the last 20 years, only 115 out of approximately 1,500 cancer drugs successfully made it through the clinical trial stage.\n\nThat’s where AI and machine learning come into play. The company’s PeDAL AI platform has as its goal the ability to identify the drug candidates with the highest possibility for success, and to do so in less time.\n\nIn November 2023, Predictive Oncologycompleted a multi-year study with UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. The goal of the study was to use AI and machine learning models to learn associations between the datasets and the short- and long-term survival rates of ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThat’s the good news. The bad news is that Predictive Oncology is not profitable, generates very little revenue, and continues to burn through cash. There is currently no analyst coverage on POAI stock, which is down 70% in the last 12 months. Nevertheless, if you can stomach that kind of risk, the potential upside for a company that may help save lives is hard to ignore.\n\nRekor Systems (REKR) Security Video Camera Vehicle number identification system. Rekor Systems *REKR) makes vehicle identification, artificial intelligence.\n\nSource: Al Serov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRekor Systems (NASDAQ:REKR) is a technology company that uses AI and machine learning for “intelligent infrastructure solutions.” This includes areas such as smart cities, however, one area that jumps out as we enter an election year is public safety.\n\nMany cities are wrestling with the idea of how to do more with less. Tools such as Rekor Scout, which “enables accurate license plate and vehicle recognition” is one solution that Rekor provides.\n\nUnlike many AI penny stocks, REKR stock is up 91% in the last 12 months. That may have some investors concerned that any future growth is fully priced in. The stock isn’t widely covered by analysts and only 40% of the stock is owned by institutional investors. However, two analysts do give the stock a price target of $4.50 which would be a 16% upside from its current level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Tech Stocks Set to Skyrocket on Strong AI Chip Demand",
        "content": "So much for a chip dip? Taiwan Semiconductor Company (NYSE:TSM), one of the world’s largest chip foundries, issued a strong outlook for 2024 Thursday, news that sent its shares surging 8%. Investors were excited by the fact that Taiwan Semi said it expected revenue to be up more than 20% this year.\n\nThe solid sales guidance from Taiwan Semi is a particularly good sign for the rest of the tech sector, especially customers that use its chips. That includes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is by far the biggest customer of TSMC, accounting for 23% of its total sales in 2022. Shares of Apple rose 3% Thursday. But it’s not the only big tech stock piggybacking off Taiwan Semi’s gains.\n\nTaiwan Semi Lifts Chip Stocks with Strong Forecast\n\nThe entire chip sector got a boost Thursday, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) rising more than 3%. Some of the biggest winners in the SOX were other top Taiwan Semi customers, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese companies are all set to benefit from the continued explosive growth in demand for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia and AMD are already leaders in this market and other semiconductor companies are ramping up their AI chip production as well. Taiwan Semi gave a clear indication Thursday that AI demand is booming and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nTaiwan Semi CEO C.C. Wei said during the earnings call that even though last year was a “challenging” one for the chip industry, “we also witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications with TSMC as a key enabler.” Wei added that AI chip demand is “robust” and that “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC.”\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSure, it may be tough for top chip stocks to do even better than they did in 2023. The SOX was up about 60% last year while Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom all topped that. But as the AI revolution marches on, the unbridled optimism from TSMC’s Wei about AI can’t be ignored.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s more, the fact that Samsung just launched an AI-enabled version of its Galaxy smartphone likely means that an AI iPhone isn’t likely to be too far behind. As long as Taiwan Semi keeps pumping out AI chips for Apple and semiconductor giants Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm, then TSM and these six other big tech stocks will likely all continue to ride the momentum of the AI wave.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) shares rose Thursday after Bank of America upgraded the tech company to \"Buy.\" Analysts led by Wamsi Mohan raised their price target on the stock to $225 per share, implying a more than 20% upside from Wednesday's closing price.\n\nBank of America sees the upcoming launch of the Vision Pro as a catalyst for the stock. In a note to clients, the team wrote it expects a \"stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by need for the latest hardware to enable Generative AI features to be introduced in 2024/2025.\"\n\nYahoo Finance Anchors Brad Smith and Seana Smith break down the latest analyst call on Apple.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Apple shares are getting a boost today as Bank of America takes a bullish stance on the company saying, they expect AI and the Vision Pro headset to drive a massive upside for the stock.\n\nThis comes as the tech giant is taking on its latest smartwatches agreeing to sell the Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches without its blood oxygen feature here. So two very different components to think about here. But at the end of the day, when you think about this upgrade that's come forward this morning, and perhaps having a more pronounced move on the stock, at least, during today's session, there were two things that stuck out from this call from Wamsi Mohan. One, stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycles driven by the latest need for hardware to enable generative AI features. Two, higher growth in services. That is on pace, well on pace. And it has been to reach that $100 billion annualized run rate just in that segment for this company alone.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah, Brad. When you take a look at the reaction that we're seeing in the stock just over an hour and 15 minutes into the trading day, we're looking at gains of over 2.5%. And that's really why we are seeing, as you look to the bottom right-hand corner of your screen, the S&P and the NASDAQ holding onto gains. And why we also are seeing a larger losses in the Dow. Apple, the second top performer in the Dow today.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut digging into this upgrade here from Bank of America, and what stuck out to me in this report was just how optimistic they are about the Vision Pro. And they went on to say that they think the Vision Pro could surpass iPad revenue over time. And they think that because the spatial computing takes hold offering, differentiated use cases that would drive then the upside that they expect to see in services. And a lot of this new technology with VR, with AR will then they think prompt people to upgrade their iPhones. And Bank of America noting that a large part of the install base still uses the iPhone 11.\n\nSo this bullish case offsetting any of the concern that we saw play out in the market yesterday from that ruling, when it comes to the smartwatches. And even there, I would say, this is almost a win for Apple in terms of how they are navigating this situation. They were able to make a software fix. So they are still able to sell the smart wear-- the smartwatches here in the US, which then could potentially be a big win there for them down the line.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely. You had mentioned the Vision Pro. And a lot of our viewers see that Vision Pro on screen, they see $3,500. And it's a good reminder right now that we're still in the very early adoption phase for those who are even going to fork over that type of money for a device that still does not have the amount of developers that are even putting content into it, the partnerships that Apple is going to see come forward. So even in our conversations with Wedbush's Dan Ives in the past, he said, that this needs to get slimmer in terms of the product design.\n\nAlso, we need to see a trimmed down price as well. And he anticipates that future iterations could see this come down as low as maybe $1,500, which actually puts it in the range of a MacBook.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. And then that would certainly change the conversation, right?\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah.\n\nSEANA SMITH: We're not going to be talking about $3,500 device. We'll be talking about $1,500 device. And you would think that maybe that would be enough for people to try it out. But we'll see.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Absolutely.",

Discover Financial Services (DFS) is a standout as the company's net interest income is down 62% year-over-year. Compliance issues and shake-ups in the C-suite continue to weigh heavily on the company.\n\nYahoo Finance Reporter Madison Mills reports live from the New York Stock Exchange to break down the latest developments for these companies.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nMADISON MILLS: My source is here on the floor telling me this morning that we have TSMC to thank for turning this week of decliners around a little bit. This TSMC report showing that revenue is going to be increasing by up to 20% year over year. That comes after TSMC was struggling with a couple of years of decliners on their balance sheet, now seeing a little bit of a bounce back moving forward.\n\nAnd as you mentioned, Seana, that's not just good news for TSMC. It's a rising tide lifting all ships. We're seeing positive movement in Nvidia and AMD this morning. The Sox Index which tracks the semiconductor names also in the green here following that TSMC report. And I also want to mention that Apple upgrade you talked about earlier. Apple also going up on this TSMC news because Apple is TSMC's biggest client. If TSMC is expecting increased revenue, that could be a boon for Apple moving forward.\n\nNow, in a little bit less rosy news. I do want to talk about the regional struggling with the same things that the larger banks are struggling with this week, and really since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the run up in interest rates weighing on these balance sheets for these regional banks.\n\nBut I want to zero in specifically on Discover because this is the top trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform. This name down a little bit over 6%. Last time I checked this morning, it's about net interest income for all of these banks. And Discover's net interest income down 62% year over year. If that wasn't bad enough, their forward guidance also showing a decline of about 10%, depending on the interest rate outlook. So again, hearing that renewed call about what the interest rate outlook is going to look like.\n\nNow, this comes after compliance issues weighing on Discover's balance sheet, also shakeups in the c-suite. And I want to pull out a quote from their interim CEO who talked about those compliance issues, saying, \"We've taken steps to strengthen our risk management and compliance issues, but those steps are not enough to lift this name today.\"",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. shares have struggled with the perception that its growth heyday is in the past. Its virtual reality headset — the tech giant’s biggest innovation in years — is unlikely to play a major role in changing that view anytime soon.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Pakistan’s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Singapore Minister Quits After Biggest Graft Case Since 1986 Dimon Says China Risk-Reward Equation Has ‘Changed Dramatically’\n\nThe iPhone maker is set to begin taking orders for the Vision Pro on Friday and Wall Street analysts are anticipating modest sales of the $3,499 device, which so far doesn’t seem to offer the kind of must-have features that have made the company’s signature smartphone a perennial blockbuster. The lack of a pronounced growth catalyst for Apple is a key reason why its market capitalization has dropped below that of Microsoft Corp, seen as a key beneficiary of artificial intelligence.\n\n“It’s hard to ask someone to pay $3,500 for a product where there’s a limited amount of content people can’t get on their phone, which means it’ll be pretty darn niche-y, at least for a couple years,” said Denny Fish, who manages tech sector funds at Janus Henderson.\n\nExcitement for the device on Wall Street has been tepid, with projections for a relatively small impact. At UBS, Apple is seen shipping 300,000 to 400,000 units this year. At the high end, the device would contribute $1.4 billion in revenue and a couple of pennies to earnings per share, amounts analyst David Vogt called “immaterial” for a company that had sales of $383 billion in fiscal 2023.\n\nWhile Apple earned its reputation as one of the Magnificent Seven of 2023, jumping nearly 50% and hitting a record as recently as December, it has struggled out of the gate this year. The stock has fallen by about 3% this month, while the Nasdaq 100 Index is down less than 1%. Among the seven megacap stocks that led last year’s market’s advance, only Tesla Inc. has fared worse.\n\nStory continues\n\nMostly muted expectations for the Vision Pro encapsulate the problems facing Apple, which has reported four-consecutive quarters of shrinking revenue, its worst run since 2001. In a high-profile snub of the new technology, Netflix Inc. — which competes with Apple for subscribers in streaming — said it isn’t planning to launch an app for the device.\n\nWhile the Cupertino, California-based company is projected to return to growth in 2024, at roughly 3% it’s half the expansion expected for the overall S&P 500 tech sector this fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. By contrast, Microsoft’s revenue is expected to rise 15% in the current fiscal year.\n\nSuch a growth rate is hardly inspiring for investors considering Apple’s premium valuation, especially amid a backdrop of antitrust-related uncertainty. At 27 times projected profits, it’s priced well above the Nasdaq 100 as well as its own average over the past 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe stock has received at least three downgrades in 2024 and Wall Street’s relatively cautious stance toward the company stands in contrast to other megacaps. Just 62% of firms recommend buying the stock, compared with ratios above 85% for Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. Alphabet Inc., Nvidia Corp., and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nOf course, Apple continues to have its enthusiastic backers that cite factors like robust cash flow and share buybacks as offsets to growth concerns. The stock has repeatedly acted as a flight-to-safety play in periods of uncertainty or market turmoil.\n\nBank of America upgraded the stock to buy from neutral Thursday, anticipating a stronger iPhone upgrade cycle driven by the need for the latest hardware to enable generative AI in 2024-2025.\n\n“It is hard to bet against Apple given its cash flow and the loyalty of its customers, and the stock doesn’t look overly expensive given the quality of the company,” said Tom Plumb, manager of the Plumb Balanced Fund. “However, I do think the stock will be rangebound until it can excite people from a revenue-growth perspective, and there’s very little visibility as to what the next big thing will be.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. expects a return to solid growth this quarter and gave itself room to raise capital spending in 2024, suggesting the world’s most valuable chipmaker anticipates a recovery in smartphone and computing demand. Samsung Electronics Co. is pinning its hopes for a mobile revival on artificial intelligence. Apple will begin selling versions of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches without a blood oxygen feature in the US, following a legal setback in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp. Ads running on Meta Platforms Inc.’s apps saw return on spending increase by an average of 32% with the help of artificial intelligence, global business group head Nicola Mendelsohn said. Fujitsu Ltd. has promised it won’t bid for more UK government contracts until the outcome of a public inquiry into the Post Office scandal, in which hundreds of people were wrongly convicted for theft or false accounting after using the technology company’s Horizon software.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n—With assistance from Thyagaraju Adinarayan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way The Downfall of Diddy Inc.

In a statement, the music streaming service slammed the new rules.\n\n“Once again, Apple has demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to protect the profits they exact on the backs of developers and consumers under their app store monopoly,” the company said in a statement.\n\n“Their latest move in the US — imposing a 27% fee for transactions made outside of an app on a developer’s website — is outrageous and flies in the face of the court's efforts to enable greater competition and user choice.”\n\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, said the changes were part of a \"bad-faith 'compliance' plan,\" and called the revised fees \"anticompetitive.\"\n\nThe new App Store rules come after the US Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear Apple’s appeal to a lower court’s ruling that required Apple to let developers offer a third-party payment option for app purchases. An appeal by Epic was similarly denied. A smartphone with the Epic Games logo is seen in front of the Apple logo in this illustration on May 2, 2021. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nEpic Games originally filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in 2020, claiming that Apple’s refusal to allow app developers to offer third-party payment options in their iOS apps violated antitrust laws. In particular, Epic took issue with the 15% and 30% fees Apple charged developers when consumers made app purchases via Apple’s payment system. The fees, they said, positioned the App Store as an illegal monopoly that blocked competitors from the revenue stream.\n\nUS District Court Judge Gonzalez Rogers held that while Apple didn’t break federal antitrust laws, it did violate California’s Unfair Competition law by not letting developers offer their own payment options.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Epic Games and Apple appealed Gonzalez Rogers’s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals before trying to get their cases heard in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe appeals court also said Epic failed to establish Apple's App Store as a relevant market. The court went on to say that Epic failed to meet a requirement to show a substantially less restrictive means by which Apple could maintain its iOS ecosystem.\n\nHowever, the Ninth Circuit let Gonzalez Rogers’s determination that Apple had violated California’s Unfair Competition law stand. To remedy the violation, the court ordered Apple to let developers include pathways for their users to make in-app purchases outside the App Store.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple updated its app store rules giving developers the option to include a link to a separate website that users could use to make app purchases. But there’s a catch. Apple has changed its App Store fee structure, but critics aren't satisfied. (AP Foto/Andy Wong, Archivo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nDevelopers will still have to pay Apple a fee. Instead of the 15% or 30% charges, though, Apple will assess developers a 12% or 27% fee. The 12% fee will apply to developers that take part in Apple’s Small Business Program. The 27% applies to larger developers.\n\nIn order for developers to offer a third-party payment option to their users, they must include a disclosure sheet that will pop up whenever a user taps a link to make an outside payment. The disclosure sheet warns that Apple, “is not responsible for the privacy or security of purchases made on the web.”\n\nApple’s App Store is under fire across the Atlantic as well. The company recently filed an appeal to the European Commission’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which could force the iPhone maker to completely overhaul its App Store business model. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple is appealing the EU's designation calling its App Store a single business. Instead, Apple says the App Store is actually five separate businesses with each one pertaining to its different operating systems: iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and iPadOS.\n\nIt’s not just the DMA, though. The US Justice Department is also reportedly preparing to file an antitrust suit against Apple related to hardware and software business practices, according to Bloomberg. The DOJ hasn’t decided if it’s going to move forward with the suit yet, but if it does, it could come as soon as March.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Apple upgraded, Palo Alto initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nBofA upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $225, up from $208. The firm sees a stronger multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle driven by the need for the latest hardware to enable generative artificial intelligence features to be introduced in 2024 and 2025.  Argus upgraded Pinterest (PINS) to Buy from Hold with a $45 price target. More than half of the company's users have intention to purchase prior to visiting the Pinterest platform, and the firm sees more of these users, higher engagement, increased ad prices and higher ad loads to drive growth. Piper Sandler upgraded Tempur Sealy(TPX) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $61, up from $41. Tempur has become a dominant operator within the mattress industry, with a multi-year growth outlook that is becoming highly attractive to long-term investors, the firm tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley upgraded Hertz (HTZ) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $15, down from $16. While the company's \"aggressive EV strategy\" has exacerbated significant challenges in both fleet cost and operating expense per unit, Hertz has begun to take \"decisive action to address self-inflicted challenges from its large EV fleet,\" the analyst tells investors. Given about 90% upside to its revised price target, the firm sees \"an improved risk reward,\" the analyst added. Wolfe Research upgraded Analog Devices (ADI) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $225 price target. The company's \"healthy cuts and flexible manufacturing model create a reasonable scenario\" for second half of fiscal 2024 improvement as inventory burns off, the firm says. Wolfe also upgraded Microchip (MCHP) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to Outperform from Peer Perform.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nOdeon Capital downgraded Wells Fargo(WFC) to Hold from Buy with a $48.80 price target. Wells reported earnings of 86c per share in Q4, but there appears to have been 43c in net one-time charges, suggesting operating earnings of $1.29 per share in the quarter, which the bank \"may not be able to replicate until mid-2026,\" the firm says.  Keefe Bruyette downgraded Charles Schwab(SCHW) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $70, down from $75. The firm still likes the Schwab story over a multi-year view, but believes catalysts \"will simply take time to play out, with most of them 2025 events.\" Citi downgraded Spirit Airlines(SAVE) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $4, down from $13. Although JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit can still appeal Tuesday's court ruling, which blocked the carriers' proposed merger, it is unclear why JetBlue wouldn't cut its losses here and recognize that it avoided a risky bid on a highly levered carrier with steep losses, the firm says. BofA downgraded Playtika (PLTK) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $8, down from $11. The firm cites a \"tepid\" growth outlook and lack of catalysts for the downgrade.  DA Davidson downgraded Varonis (VRNS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $45, up from $37. The firm sees ARR growth potentially accelerating from 15-16% this year to 20% plus in FY24 given Copilot driven deals and increased SaaS conversions with existing customers, but believes shares are fully pricing this in with shares up 89% since last May. The firm continues to believe the SaaS transition will play out quicker than expected and\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nBernstein initiated coverage of Palo Alto Networks (PAWN) with an Outperform rating and $402 price target. Palo Alto's platform play appears well-positioned, and may help grow top line 3-4-times by 2030, and put FY26 growth +15% above consensus, the firm tells investors in a research note.  Bernstein initiated coverage of Crowdstrike (CRWD) and SentinelOne (S) with Outperform ratings and price targets of $334 and $34, respectively. The firm says CrowdStrike and SentinelOne are the two leading best-of-breed players in endpoint security targeting cloud technical horizons.  Bernstein initiated coverage of Cloudflare (NET) with a Market Perform rating and $85 price target. The company appears \"reasonably durable relative to competitors\" in its core CDN and internet security market, but it is not clear if it will have as much success in new product extensions, the firm says. Bernstein also initiated Fortinet (FTNT) with a Market Perform.  Bernstein initiated coverage of Zscaler (ZS) with an Outperform rating and $311 price target. Zscaler's Secure Service Edge is well-positioned competitively in its target customer profile, and is a \"best of breed\" winner in SSE/SASE, the firm tells investors in a research note.  Citi initiated coverage of Jack Henry (JKHY) with a Neutral rating and $177 price target. The company offers a compounding opportunity, but Citi requires more confidence in greater multiple expansion or a better entry point for this quality name.",

        "content": "Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia. Photo: Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters (©Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters)\n\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 gains (^GSPC) last year but can they repeat those extraordinary returns in 2024?\n\nThis group of mega-cap tech giants – Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) – are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing.\n\nIn 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500.\n\nHere’s what to expect as Tesla kicks off the mega-caps’ reporting season on 24 January.\n\nTesla (TSLA) – reporting on 24 January\n\nShares in Elon Musk’s EV maker doubled in value over 2023, gaining 102%, as the company is expected to report revenues of $25.5bn (£20.1bn).\n\nTesla has reported 485,000 deliveries for Q4 2023, marking an increase of about 20% versus the last year.\n\n“Tesla has already given insight into its performance via the quarterly vehicle production and delivery data released ahead of the financial results. In the fourth quarter it produced 494,989 vehicles and delivered 484,507 vehicles, the bulk of which were Model 3 or Y,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\n“It managed to hit a 1.8 million annual delivery target which effectively gave it breathing space amid market worries that competition was biting at its heels, particularly China’s BYD which surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles last quarter,” he added.\n\nThere are concerns around a stall in its automotive sales with no new model launch and delayed Cybertruck ramp-up.\n\nAnalyst forecast for the next set of quarterly results is $0.72 earnings per share.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – reporting on 30 January\n\nMicrosoft managed to steal the title of most valuable company in the world from Apple in 2024, with the software giant’s bet on AI paying off.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella has made a push for Microsoft to assume a global leadership role in AI. The company has a significant stake in leading AI startup ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, and reportedly invested up to $13bn in the startup.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis alliance has been considered one of the tech industry’s most lucrative tie-ups.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft’s market capitalisation stood at $2.895tn, a new record high for the company, and above Apple’s market cap of $2.825tn.\n\nThe last time the software giant earned the title of most valuable company in the world was back in 2021.\n\nThe consensus analyst forecast for the next set of quarterly results is earnings per share at $2.29 and revenue at $52.94bn.\n\nRead more: FTSE top trending tickers of 2023\n\n“The big issues are whether Microsoft can sustain robust growth in cloud computing and how it can take AI to the next level,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Seen by most as the dominant AI software play, its apps are already critical to millions of businesses, so wrapping functionality into Windows, Microsoft 365, Azure and more through its Copilot tools offers immense potential.\n\n“It is not all champagne and caviar for Microsoft. Its success has naturally attracted the attention of various regulators and competition authorities and like its mega cap peers, there are growing concerns that the company has become too dominant. Antitrust probes are likely to be a key focus for investors in 2024.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) – reporting on 30 January\n\nThe search engine giant appears to be playing catch-up in the AI race and announced hundreds of job cuts in an effort to reduce costs. But the stock is still a buy with most analysts given its powerful free cash flow.\n\nMost analysts are expecting Alphabet to report a 12% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, to $85.26bn, which should translate to a 51% increase in per-share earnings to $1.60, up from $1.05 in the same year-ago period.\n\n“Alphabet has beaten market expectations for both earnings per share and revenue over the past three consecutive quarterly results. Investors will be hoping it can make it four in a row on 30 January,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Cloud computing is the big unknown – one minute Alphabet is thriving in this area, the next it cannot sustain growth momentum. Competition is fierce and this is a difficult one to call ahead of the results.\n\n“YouTube continues to go from strength to strength, with millions of people now treating the platform as a priority place to consume content.\n\nApple (AAPL) – reporting on 30 January\n\nApple has taken overtaken Samsung (005930.KS)as the world’s biggest phone maker but that might not be enough to convince investors amid dwindling iPhone sales in China.\n\nApple added $1tn in market cap in 2023 even as it has reported revenue declines from the prior year in four consecutive quarters.\n\nAnalysts forecast Apple to report $2.09 earnings per share and $118bn revenue amid weakness in China and global waning demand for Mac computers and iPads.\n\n“The company used to have a reputation for bringing out truly innovative products and shaking up the marketplace. In recent years that reputation has soured as there have only been new iterations of the same products,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“The momentous change could be the Vision Pro headset which goes on sale in February 2024. While the $3,500 price point looks high, people pay that for high-end laptops and this could feasibly be another ‘must-have’ product for Apple fans.\n\n“The key issue to monitor is whether Apple’s output can meet demand as last year there were reports it had to drastically cut production forecasts for the Vision Pro due to the complexity of its design.”\n\nMeta Platforms (META) – reporting on 1 February\n\nIts year of efficiency, that saw the company pivot away from the metaverse push, allowed Meta to achieve a remarkable return of 194% in 2023.\n\nHowever, what can investors expect when Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook owner, sold almost half a billion dollars’ worth of the company’s shares at the end of last year. It was the first time he sold shares in almost two years.\n\nAnalysts forecast $4.96 earnings per share in Meta’s fourth quarter for 2023 versus a $1.76 per share loss in the same period a year earlier. Revenue is estimated be $39bn versus $34.15bn one quarter earlier.\n\n“The results are likely to include a reiteration that expenses are going to rise in 2024, driven by higher infrastructure-related costs and investment in AI. The hype around the metaverse has died down but it continues to plug away at the concept and any success from Apple’s Vision Pro headset could revive public interest in virtual worlds,” Coatsworth said.\n\nRead more: ChatGPT portfolio outperforms the UK’s top 10 most popular funds\n\n“Meta has a big folder of AI ideas such as language translation and Instagram users reimagining their photos, but these seem unlikely to generate meaningful revenue, so advertising will remain key in terms of income for the near future,” he added.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – reporting on 21 February\n\nAmazon saw its stock surge 81% in 2023 and is betting that generative AI will produce tens of billions in revenue for Amazon Web Services in the next few years.\n\nAmazon aims to be a dominant player in the market despite being slow to invest in this technology.\n\nThe company also has a strong position in TV, film and music streaming and although the stock is not inexpensive, shares are the cheapest they have been in over 10 years.\n\nAmazon has guided for net sales between $160bn and $167bn, equating to 7% to 12% growth versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The analyst consensus forecast is $0.78 earnings per share and $165.86bn revenue.\n\n“The uncertain economic outlook raises the prospect that companies are continuing to find new ways to save money including paring back IT costs which could be problematic for Amazon’s cloud computing division. Potentially offsetting this issue is greater corporate interest in AI which could benefit the group,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Amazon has been rolling out new versions of AI chips which it said offer enhanced performance and announced plans to invest up to $4bn in Anthropic, a US company generating AI systems and large language models. AI may be the ‘hot theme’ in tech but keeping up with rivals, let alone overtaking them, can be a costly exercise,” he added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – reporting on 21 February\n\nThe AI boom of these tech mega-caps would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year.\n\nWith demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year.\n\nThe analyst consensus forecast for its next quarterly results is $4.49 earnings per share and $20.06bn revenue.\n\nRead more: How AI boom will benefit these nine chipmakers in 2024\n\n“Nvidia is going all-in on AI, believing the world is on the cusp of a radical shift in technology usage. Companies in every industry are exploring ways to deploy AI to improve productivity and that creates a huge runway for Nvidia to grow its earnings,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Its key challenge is to keep up with demand and to keep innovating, rolling out new products that can help companies while also ensuring it remains at the forefront of the AI industry. Nvidia is the dominant force in market and there is no room for complacency, otherwise competition will be biting at its heels,” he added.\n\nWatch: Why tech will still be 'one of the leaders' in 2024<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/magnificent-seven-continue-dominating-markets-210500660.html\\\">nonstop talks of the Magnificent Seven and AI</a>.

In November, the Masimo W1 watch received FDA approval to include usage by adults in hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities and homes as a medical device.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nMasimo’s shares rose 2.1% on Jan 17. Shares of the company have lost 25.1% in the past year against the industry’s 0.5% growth. The S&P 500 has witnessed 22% growth in the said time frame. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDispute in Details\n\nMasimo sued Apple in 2020 when the latter added a blood oxygen sensor to its watches, starting with Series 6. Following a three-year long battle, Masimo received its first favorable ruling against Apple. In October last year, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that a blood-oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch models infringed on Masimo's patents. This led to a ban on the import of infringing watch models by Apple in the United States.\n\nHowever, Apple appealed against the ITC’s ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals that granted a temporary stay to the import ban, allowing Apple to sell watches with disputed blood oxygen sensor in the U.S. market during the holiday season in December.\n\nAlthough the litigation will continue at the U.S. Court of Appeals, the temporary stay on import ban will discontinue. With the removal of stay on the import ban, Apple will continue to market the disputed Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches, but disable a blood-oxygen monitoring feature. The company stated that watches with blood oxygen sensors that have already been sold will continue to have the feature. Moreover, the ban on the sale of certain Apple watches only applies to the U.S. market. The ruling does not impact any international sale of the watches.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe import ban may impact Apple’s revenues insignificantly as it continues to sell its watches in all markets with disabled blood oxygen sensor for certain models. However, the legal dispute is likely to tarnish the image of the company that may have a long-term impact. Masimo has also stated that fighting the battle with one of the biggest companies in the world is to lay focus on Apple’s image as a corporate bully engaged in the brazen theft of intellectual property.\n\nMasimo Corporation Price Masimo Corporation Price\n\nMasimo Corporation price | Masimo Corporation Quote\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nMasimo currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best global dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors across the globe are increasingly drawn to stocks that provide regular dividends as a strategy to secure a steady income stream. To enhance wealth accumulation, opting for investments in global dividend companies presents an advantageous approach. When investors choose global dividend companies, they are essentially selecting businesses with a widespread international presence. These companies have proven themselves capable of generating profits on a global scale, often demonstrating resilience across different markets and economic conditions. By diversifying investments across such globally positioned firms, investors not only gain exposure to a variety of industries but also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stand out as notable examples of robust dividend-paying entities that boast a strong and influential global footprint.\n\nIn 2022, global dividends experienced substantial growth, registering an impressive 8.4% increase to reach a historic high of $1.56 trillion, in line with the projections outlined by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. This growth was marked by record payouts in 12 countries, and a notable 88% of companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts. However, the momentum in global dividends took a downturn in 2023. This decline was attributed to reduced special dividends and a limited number of corporations implementing significant cuts to investor remuneration. Although the comprehensive data for the entire year is yet to be disclosed, the third-quarter report from Janus Henderson revealed a 0.9% decrease in global dividends to $421.9 billion during that period. As a consequence of these developments, there was a slight adjustment to the 2023 dividend forecast, with the estimate revised to $1.63 trillion from the previous projection of $1.64 trillion. Despite this marginal reduction, the forecasted figure still represents a record-breaking amount, showcasing a 4.4% increase from the global dividends recorded in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite a decline in worldwide dividend payouts, experts anticipate a potential resurgence of dividend stocks in the coming year. The yields experienced a decline towards the end of 2023, and there is a possibility of further decreases if the Federal Reserve decides to reduce interest rates. The outlook suggests that despite the prevailing challenges, dividend stocks might see a rebound in the future. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, expressed a preference for dividend stocks within sectors such as technology and healthcare due to their growth potential. Unlike the conventional defensive categories like utilities, he emphasized the importance of investing in dividend stocks that exhibit growth qualities. According to Adam, his firm specifically focuses on dividend stocks that not only present favorable valuations but also demonstrate the capability to sustain their growth over time.\n\nMr. Adam's inclination toward dividend growth stocks aligns with historical evidence indicating their consistent outperformance. Looking at the Russell 1000 index, companies that increased their dividends exhibited an average stock price outperformance of 3.1% in the six months following the announcement of the dividend increase, as per Morgan Stanley data from 2014 onwards. In contrast, companies that reduced their dividends experienced an underperformance of 4.7% in stock prices during the same six-month period.\n\nExpanding on these points, we will explore the best global dividend stocks in this article. 11 Best Global Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds for the third quarter of 2023 and picked companies that operate internationally.

These stocks are a great investment option for anyone who wants to generate income and build wealth over the long term.\n\nThese stocks, known for their consistent dividend payments and potential for growth, offer several advantages that make them highly attractive to investors.\n\nWhen you’re looking for solid dividend stocks, one thing to consider is the consistency of dividend payouts. You want your dividend stocks to pay out quarterly or even monthly and have a consistent payout. Avoid companies that are cutting their dividend, because that’s a sure sign of trouble afoot. Even better, find a dividend stock with a history of increasing its payout.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRegular income can prove to be invaluable, especially for retirees who rely on investment income as a primary source of cash flow. Investors can also reinvest their dividend payouts to increase their positions. This allows investors to acquire more shares of the same solid dividend stocks over time, leading to potential compounded growth.\n\nWe used the Portfolio Grader and Dividend Grader tools to choose some solid dividend stocks to start 2024.

The products help people who aren’t financial professionals do their personal taxes without going to a tax preparer or accountant.\n\nIntuit also owns Credit Karma, which allows people to monitor their credit and offers credit card and loan recommendations, and Mailchimp, which is a marketing, automation and email platform.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Oct. 31, 2023) included $3 billion in revenue, up 15% from a year ago. Income was $307 million or 85 cents per share, up from $76 million and 14 cents per share a year ago.\n\nManagement is expecting full-year revenue to be in a range from $15.89 billion to $16.1 billion, which would be an increase of 11% to 12% from a year ago. INTU pays a dividend yield of .6% and the stock is up 54% in the last year. It also gets “B” ratings in the Dividend Grader and the Portfolio Grader.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a global leader in payment processing and credit cards. The company does business in over 200 countries and accounts for more than half of the cards in circulation.\n\nVisa doesn’t lend money directly but serves as a link between banks, customers, and businesses. Visa makes money from assessment fees that are charged for processing merchants’ credit card or debit card transactions. Visa also makes money by allowing banks to brand its cards with the Visa name.\n\nThe U.S. economy is stronger than expected and consumers are still more than willing to incur debt for major and household purchases. As long as the consumer is bullish on the economy, Visa will continue seeing profits.\n\nEarnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 (ending Sept. 30, 2023), included $8.6 billion in revenue, up 11% from a year ago.

TJX operates several low-cost department store chains, including Marshall’s HomeGoods, Sierra, and T.J. Maxx, and sells clothing, home goods and furnishings. In total, it has over 4,900 locations.\n\nAs a discount retailer, its offerings vary from store to store and often, week to week.

Net income was $1.19 billion, or $1.03 per share, versus $1.06 billion and 91 cents per share a year ago.\n\nTJX stock is up 15% in the last year and provides a dividend yield of 1.4%. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader and an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.\n\nVerisk Analytics (VRSK) Two businesspeople holding and pointing at earnings charts.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVerisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK) is a data analytics and risk assessment firm based in New Jersey, right outside New York City.

The earnings results and management guidance would be crucial for market participants to gauge the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nAs of Jan 12, 29 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their financial numbers. Total earnings for these index members are up 7.6% from the same period last year on 6% higher revenues, with 93.1% beating EPS estimates and 55.2% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt present, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index in fourth-quarter 2024 are expected to be up 0.1% on 2.2% higher revenues. This follows the 3.8% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues in the third quarter and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings before that.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of Dow stocks — popularly known as blue-chip stocks — with a favorable Zacks Rank are set to beat on earnings results. Investment in these stocks should be prudent going forward.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that are poised to beat on earnings results. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings releases. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Inc. is benefiting from strong demand for iPhone. AAPL expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 reported figure.\n\nAAPL expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. For the Services segment, AAPL expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Apple has an Earnings ESP of +3.65%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.2% for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nApple recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.5%. The company is set to release earnings results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.\n\nThe Boeing Co. remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.\n\nA strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost BA’s Defense, Space & Security's segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term. Our model projects BA's total revenues to increase in 2023-2025 time period.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Boeing has an Earnings ESP of +0.33%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.9% over the last 30 days. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Co. continues to witness positive business trends as reflected by its robust surprise history. KO’s sales and earnings beat estimates for the third consecutive quarter in third-quarter 2023. Strong revenue growth across most of its operating segments aided by improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales boosted the results.\n\nKO is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. KO provided upbeat guidance for 2023. We anticipate organic revenue growth of 10% for 2023. We expect positive price/mix of 9.3% and an increase of 1.5% in concentrate volume for 2023.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Coca-Cola has an Earnings ESP of +1%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 90 days.\n\nCoca-Cola recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 5.1%. The company is set to release earnings results on Feb 13, before the opening bell.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Co. has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. PG has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.\n\nThis led to the top and bottom lines beating the consensus mark for the fifth consecutive quarter in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consequently, PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view. We estimate all-in sales to increase 3.7% year over year in fiscal 2024.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Procter & Gamble has an Earnings ESP of +0.48%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.8% for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 90 days.\n\nProcter & Gamble recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 23, before the opening bell.\n\nThe Travelers Companies Inc. boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, a rise in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.\n\nTRV’s commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. TRV remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth at auto and homeowners business. TRV expects fixed-income net investment income to be around $615 million after tax for the fourth quarter.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Travelers Companies has an Earnings ESP of +1.56%.

        "content": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is ready to boost its iPhone production in India, with an expected reach of $12 billion in Freight On Board (FOB) value by 2023-24, according to a report by local publication Business Standard. This initiative not only overshadows the initial plan of shifting nearly 9% of its total production to India by fiscal year 2024 but also denotes a significant rise in Apple's involvement in the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.\n\nIn the first three quarters of the fiscal year 2024, Apple, in collaboration with its suppliers, Foxconn Hon Hai, Pegatron India (currently part of Tata Group), and Wistron, has already produced iPhones worth $9.4 billion ( INR 781.72 billion) in India. Surpassing its full-year commitment of $8.9 billion (INR 740.16 billion) under the PLI scheme, this figure signifies a notable increase in production capacity.\n\nInterestingly, only a quarter of these iPhones will serve the Indian market, with the majority intended for export to regions such as the US, Europe, and West Asia.\n\nSee Also: UPI Goes International: Google India And NPCI Sign MoU For Global Expansion\n\nThe turnover of Apple's India sector was approximately $5.94 billion (INR 493.2 billion) for FY23, as reported by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. This figure represents a mere 1.5% of its global turnover of $383.2 billion.\n\nApple's production and export strategy in India appears to be in sync with seasonal fluctuations and global demand patterns. Exports soared to 80% of total iPhone production in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024, aligning with the global launch of iPhone 15 and the surge in demand during the festive season in the US and Europe.\n\nBased on projections by JP Morgan, Apple may divert up to 25% of its total iPhone production to India by 2026, indicating a significant overhaul in its global supply chain and production strategies.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto Courtesy: Sophia Stark on Unsplash\n\nRead Next: Apple's New 15-Floor Office In Bengaluru Can Accommodate 1,200 Employees And 740 Cars\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple Plans Ambitious iPhone Production Ramp Up In India, Targets $12B Value By 2023-24 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. expects a return to solid growth this quarter and gave itself room to raise capital spending in 2024, suggesting the world’s most valuable chipmaker anticipates a recovery in smartphone and computing demand.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap Singapore Minister Quits After Biggest Graft Case Since 1986 Dimon Says China Risk-Reward Equation Has ‘Changed Dramatically’\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. projected revenue growth of at least 8% to $18 billion to $18.8 billion in the March quarter, versus expectations for around $18.2 billion. And it’s budgeting capital expenditure of $28 billion to $32 billion, potentially up from 2023’s $30 billion.\n\nThe Taiwanese company’s outlook, while not quite surpassing the most bullish estimates, comes after a years-long slump in tech demand. But signs of a recovery for the chipmaking sector have emerged in recent weeks. The Semiconductor Industry Association estimated chip sales increased in November after more than a year of declines. Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei reiterated he expects a return to “healthy growth” this year.\n\nTSMC, which also counts Android chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. among its biggest customers, got a boost from frenzied demand for Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips in 2023. It reported net income for the fourth quarter of NT$238.7 billion ($7.6 billion), beating the average analyst estimate. Revenue was $625.5 billion, TSMC reported earlier, matching the previous holiday quarter and arresting a series of falls.\n\n“Our business has bottomed out on a year-over-year basis, and we expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC,” Wei said.\n\nClick here for a liveblog on the numbers.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC could lead global chip foundries through 2023-24 industry headwinds thanks to growing AI chip demand and migration to next-gen process nodes such as N3 in 2H23 and N2 by 2025. Although the smartphone and PC chip market remains stagnant, TSMC’s advanced packaging tech, both 2.5D and 3D, fortifies its position in the contract-chipmaking market, allowing a potential return to a 53% gross margin following a brief 2H downturn.\n\nStory continues\n\n— Charles Shum, analyst\n\nClick here for the full research.\n\nTSMC’s revenue should grow in the low- to mid-20% range this year, Wei said. That’s a rebound from the modest decline of last year.\n\nOver the course of 2023, TSMC moderated its capital expenditure plans as the consumer electronics industry grappled with a glut of unsold inventory.\n\nBut uncertainty persists. This month, fellow chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co. posted its sixth successive quarter of declining operating profit, as it weathered the impact of muted consumer demand in its own smartphone and memory businesses.\n\nQuestions also overshadow China, the world’s largest computing, smartphone, internet and chip market.\n\nApple — long one of TSMC’s most important customers — faced headwinds with its latest iPhone generation. Several analysts downgraded Apple on expectations of soft demand, and Jefferies has said the iPhone sales slump in China is likely to deepen. The US company has also been hit by a widening ban on foreign-device use among Chinese agencies and state-owned companies.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is targeting double-digit growth for its latest flagship smartphone series, powered with an array of new artificial intelligence features.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Milei’s Younger Sister Is Also ‘The Boss’ Directing His Mission\n\nSouth Korea’s largest company on Wednesday unveiled the Galaxy S24 product family, the latest iteration of its most direct iPhone rival. The devices include built-in live translation of calls and a new search tool that lets users circle an image on the phone to get related information, tapping the AI suites of Samsung and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Samsung also sprung a surprise by previewing the Galaxy Ring, an upcoming health-tracking gadget.\n\nSamsung, which last year lost its top spot in global smartphone shipments to Apple Inc., is trying to secure an early lead in the race to integrate AI. It’s set itself the ambitious target of increasing sales of the flagship substantially, and is taking a hybrid approach of combining its own AI technologies with those of Google, according to TM Roh, head of Samsung’s mobile business.\n\n“What ultimately matters is the user experience,” Roh said in an interview with Bloomberg News in San Jose, California. “We are always open to collaboration with our partners on new areas of the mobile industry.”\n\nShares were mostly unchanged in Seoul early on Thursday, following the showcase event.\n\nRead More: Samsung Bets on Google-Powered AI Features in Smartphone Revamp\n\nPartnerships will be a major element in Samsung’s push. The company has worked closely with OpenAI backer Microsoft Corp. in the past and has a longstanding pact with Google around its Android operating system. Samsung and Google started the year by announcing they’ll reduce duplication in competing with Apple’s AirDrop by uniting around a single Android Quick Share feature.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Korean tech company, also the world’s largest memory chipmaker, spent 2023 digesting insights from its users and tailoring new AI features and additions to enhance the appeal of its latest device generation. While AI and machine learning have long been used on phones, the rise of tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a rush to deliver more sophisticated services directly on people’s devices.\n\n“The AI-related features can really bring convenience and could encourage consumers to switch their phones,” said Lee Changmin, an analyst at KB Securities. Some small-cap AI-related stocks in Korea already saw some gains before the S24 was unveiled and may move again after the launch, with the deciding factor being the quality of Samsung’s new added features. KB Securities analysts including Lee estimate that Samsung may see its best Galaxy S sales in eight years with its new generation.\n\nSamsung’s plans are not limited to the new handsets, as the company plans to roll out AI features to some of its earlier models in the Galaxy S series in the first half of this year, 55-year-old Roh said. The company recorded double-digit growth between its Galaxy S22 and last year’s S23 generation, giving it confidence it can repeat the feat.\n\nBut the global smartphone market has been in the doldrums for years and was again down last year. Samsung’s own shipments declined by 13.6% in 2023, according to IDC estimates. Roh expects both to rebound in 2024, as the advent of AI injects some much-needed excitement into the category. Many consumers are also due for upgrades following a sales boom in 2021, with the typical upgrade cycle now being roughly three years, he added.\n\nRoh, like some market estimates, expects the global smartphone shipments to expand by around 5% to 6% this year, though he hopes to outperform the consensus with Samsung’s new devices.\n\nAfter ceding ground to Apple last year, Samsung sees room to regain its position. That’s because AI — even while it risks consumer fatigue with excessive hype — is not a fad, Roh said. Like the era of the internet and smartphones, AI signals a seismic shift in our relationship with technology, which may reorganize the industry’s leadership, he said.\n\n“The S24 marks just the beginning of a new era when AI technologies go mainstream,” Roh said. “Hopefully it will help revitalize the global mobile industry.”\n\n--With assistance from Youkyung Lee.\n\n(Updates with shares and analyst reaction)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) logged a smaller-than-expected decline in its fourth-quarter profit as revenue was buoyed by increased sales of its most advanced chips.\n\nThe world’s largest contract chipmaker forecast slightly weaker performance in the first quarter of 2024, but said that chip demand in the coming year will be supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by... robust AI-related demand. AI models need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware... thus the value of TSMC's technology position is increasing,\" CEO C.C. Wei said in a post-earnings call.\n\nProfit for the three months to December 31 fell to T$238.7 billion ($7.6 billion) from T$295.9 billion a year ago. On a per-share basis, profit fell to T$9.21, but still beat Investing.com estimates of T$8.67.\n\nRevenue was T$625.5 billion ($20 billion), remaining largely unchanged from the prior year, but beating estimates for a reading of T$617.24 billion. The figure was also above TSMC’s forecast for the year.\n\nRevenue improved from the prior quarter on improved demand for its 3 nanometer chips, which TSMC describes as the industry’s most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nTSMC said it expects sales in the first quarter to range between $18 billion and $18.8 billion, with a gross margin of 52% to 54%. Its gross margin for the fourth quarter was 53%.\n\nThe firm also forecast slightly higher capital expenditure for 2024, between $28 billion to $32 billion, compared to about $30.1 billion in 2023. A bulk of this expenditure will be dedicated towards high-computing chips, CEO Wei said.\n\nDemand for high-performance computing chips improved in the fourth quarter, likely boosted by increasing interest in artificial intelligence development. The launch of OpenAI’s Chat GPT bot in late-2022 had triggered a widespread rush into the development and application of similar AI products.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI development uses a large amount of computing power, which in turn requires more advanced, higher-power silicone. This also spells higher demand for TSMC.\n\nAnalysts had expected an improvement in TSMCs earnings amid dwindling inventory levels among PC and smartphone manufacturers. This also helped shore up chip demand from a lull caused by weak electronics demand, easing technology investment and high interest rates.\n\nTSMC is a key supplier to tech majors Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the latter of which has benefited greatly from increased demand for AI chips. Nvidia had recently unveiled a new line of chips dedicated solely towards AI development.\n\nTSMC’s earnings have now beaten estimates for all four quarters of 2023, which, coupled with the prospect of improving chip demand, saw the firm’s Taiwan stock rally over 30% in the past year.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

Daily call options volume on TSMC’s American depositary receipts has been building recently on bullish bets ahead of the company’s earnings report due Thursday.\n\nStill, the shares remain 15% below their record level set two years ago, even as its global chip peers and A-list clients including Nvidia Corp. have regained all-time highs on AI hype and the gradual rebound in broader chip demand. Given the muted geopolitical reaction to the Taiwan leadership vote, some investors expect a catch-up in TSMC, with the average price target implying a gain of 20% over the next year.\n\n“We hope this one issue is now out of the way and this name could finally break out given its unquestionable dominance in AI chip production,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a strategist at Asymmetric Advisors Ltd. TSMC shares may rise further on low valuations combined with the company’s better-than-expected sales and likely price hikes, he added.\n\nWorld Chip Sales Return to Growth in Sign of Improving Demand\n\nThe consensus forward earnings estimate for TSMC has climbed back to a record high, as the company beat fourth-quarter revenue expectations. The stock has 35 buy ratings versus two holds and no sells.\n\nAs the contract manufacturer of the 5-nanometer semiconductors designed by Nvidia, TSMC is seen as a prime beneficiary of the AI boom. While a recovery in smartphone demand has been slow to get off the ground, Apple Inc. is adopting the company’s more advanced, and higher priced, 3-nanometer chips in its latest iPhones.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC rallied with global chip stocks since autumn before losing some steam since the start of the year on concerns over friction with China resulting from Taiwan’s election. The presidency was won by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s Lai Ching-te, who is seen as a “separatist” by China, though his party lost the control of the parliament.\n\nLai has supported TSMC’s decision to expand manufacturing overseas, saying it strengthens the company’s as well as Taiwan’s influence internationally. Beijing has so far had a muted reaction to Lai’s victory, reiterating its opposition to the island’s independence.\n\nWhy Making Computer Chips Has Become a New Arms Race: QuickTake\n\n“I believe there will be minimal effect on TSMC” from the election, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum. “Lai’s victory suggests a continuation of Taiwan government’s semiconductor-focused economic growth strategy.”\n\nUpcoming results may highlight negative impacts from spending on factories in the US and elsewhere, as well as the strengthening of the Taiwan dollar and risings labor costs. But relative cheapness is seen supporting the stock, trading at 15 times forward earnings estimates compared with a five-year median of 18 times and Nvidia’s 28 times.\n\n“We like TSMC as we think its solid technology leadership and execution better position it vs peers to capture the industry’s long-term structural growth, particularly in areas such as 5G or AI,” Goldman Sachs Inc. analysts including Bruce Lu wrote in a note, adding that its valuation remains attractive.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAn index that tracks volatility in the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index jumped to the highest in more than two months on Wednesday after a pair of strong US economic reports boosted speculation the Federal Reserve will be in no hurry to cut interest rates, weighing on tech stocks. The Cboe NDX Volatility Index rose as much as 8.6%, hitting the highest in about two months. The spike comes after a lull in volatility that saw the index drop to the lowest since 2019 a month ago.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. is targeting double-digit growth for its latest flagship smartphone series, powered with an array of new artificial intelligence features. Apple Inc.’s iPhone dethroned Samsung Electronics Co. devices to become the best-selling smartphone series over the course of 2023, the first time South Korea’s largest company has lost the top spot since 2010. Verizon Communications Inc. is writing down the value of its business services division by $5.8 billion, a sign of the company’s declining enterprise operations. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is rolling out a series of broad changes to some of its core search, browser and data products in Europe, in order to step in line with the European Union’s new rules to rein in Big Tech’s market dominance. Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic is working on a feature that would give its chatbot Claude the ability to analyze images, according to unpublished wording contained in the code of the company’s website. The tool could widen the product’s appeal to users and help the company catch up with larger competitors. Rivian Automotive fell after Deutsche Bank downgraded the electric-vehicle maker to hold from buy, citing downside to 2024 volume and margin outlooks. Google DeepMind, Alphabet Inc.’s research division, said it has taken a “crucial step” towards making artificial intelligence as capable as humans. It involves solving high-school math problems.\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.\n\n(Updates first chart)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. isn’t planning to launch an app for Apple Inc.’s upcoming Vision Pro headset, marking a high-profile snub of the new technology by the world’s biggest video subscription service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Milei’s Younger Sister Is Also ‘The Boss’ Directing His Mission\n\nRather than designing a Vision Pro app — or even just supporting its existing iPad app on the platform — Netflix is essentially taking a pass. The company, which competes with Apple in streaming, said in a statement that users interested in watching its content on the device can do so from the web.\n\nIt’s a sizable omission for the $3,499 headset, which debuts on Feb. 2. Apple is banking on entertainment content to help market the nascent and pricey technology, and Netflix is a must-have streaming service for many consumers. Netflix also offers apps for Apple’s other devices, including the iPhone and iPad, though it doesn’t participate in the company’s TV app.\n\nThe Vision Pro will run two main types of apps: new software written specifically for the device’s interface or existing iPad applications. Apple has sought to make it easy to transfer developers’ current iPad apps over to the new platform, aiming to quickly amass a wide range of Vision Pro software.\n\nThe fact that Netflix isn’t even willing to support the iPad approach suggests that it’s taking a wait-and-see stance with the headset. It’s also a bit of a reversal for the company, which said in July that it would support its iPad app on the Vision Pro. Even then, though, Netflix didn’t plan to release software specifically for the headset’s operating system, visionOS.\n\n“Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on Macs,” Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said in the statement. Apple declined to comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn contrast with its Vision Pro strategy, Netflix did develop an app for Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest headsets, though it hasn’t been updated in years.\n\nThe approach means it will be harder for users to access Netflix on the Vision Pro. And they won’t be able to download Netflix content to watch offline, potentially making it more of a pain to use on an airplane.\n\nThe lack of an app also means Netflix watchers won’t have access to custom environments for streaming. That means Netflix can’t create specialized immersive backdrops for its users to watch videos in.\n\nWhile Netflix and Apple don’t compete in TV hardware, they’re both currently vying for subscribers in the streaming industry. Apple is a small player in this category, with less than 10% of the US market. But it’s been gathering award wins in the space, and the two companies compete over talent and production deals. It’s plausible Netflix doesn’t want to help boost a rival by giving it a key app for its upcoming launch.\n\nApple has been marketing the Vision Pro as an entertainment device in the run-up to preorders beginning on Friday. The Cupertino, California-based company said earlier this week that the headset would have many entertainment options beyond its own TV+ service. That includes programming from Disney+, Max, Peacock, ESPN and Amazon Prime Video, among others.\n\n(Updates with more details on Netflix-Apple relationship starting in second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

That temporary stay enabled Apple to renew sales of the two internet-connected watch models, the Series 9 and Ultra 2, embroiled in an intellectual-property fight with medical technology company Masimo.\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission in late October ruled a blood-oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch models infringed on Masimo's patents, resulting in Apple briefly ceasing sales of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 in late December before getting the short-lived reprieve from the appeals court.\n\nApple is still trying to persuade the federal appeals court to overturn the ITC's ruling, but Wednesday's decision means the company is no longer insulated from the U.S. sales ban.\n\nThe appeals process is expected to take at least a year, meaning Apple will be forced to stop selling its latest watch models in the U.S. through 2024 or perhaps redesign the devices in a way that complies with the ITC's ruling.\n\nIn a Monday court filing, Masimo disclosed Apple has won approval from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on revisions that would remove the blood-oxygen sensor from the watches.\n\nApple didn't have any immediate comment about how it will react to the appeals court decision, which revives the U.S. sales ban on the Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches at 2 p.m. Pacific Time Thursday.\n\nThe Cupertino, California, company also could negotiate a settlement with Masimo that would clear the way for it to continue selling the Apple Watch models with the blood-oxygen sensor. But in its appeal Apple has scoffed at the notion that its watches are relying on Masimo's patented technology, making a truce unlikely.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving to pull its two top Apple Watches from the U.S. would put a small dent in the company's annual sales of $383 billion. Although the company doesn't disclose the volume of Apple Watch sales, analyst estimate the product accounts for about $18 billion in annual revenue.\n\nThe U.S. sales ban on the Series 9 and Ultra 2 won't prevent Apple from continuing to sell its less-expensive model, called the SE, that isn't equipped with a blood-oxygen sensor. But that technology, which Apple introduced into its watch lineup in 2020, has been a key part of the company's effort to position the devices as life-saving tools to monitor users' health.\n\nIn court filings urging the appeals court to continue blocking the sales ban, Apple argued that enforcing the ITC's patent order would cause unnecessary harm to “a pioneering product made by a quintessentially American company that directly employs more than 90,000 employees\" in the U.S.\n\nMasimo argued that Apple won't be significantly harmed by the U.S. sales ban of the Apple Watch models, given most of the company's revenue comes from the iPhone. What's more, Masimo sought to portray Apple as a corporate bully engaged in the brazen theft of intellectual property widely used in hospitals and other health professionals that treat about 200 million patients annually.",

        "content": "Apple (APPL) has another hill to climb after a federal appeals court refused to grant a longer pause on the sale of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple watches, forcing the company to pull the watches that have a blood oxygen measuring sensor feature from its US store shelves for a second time.\n\nThe ban stems from its patent dispute with Massimo (MASI) which alleges Apple was infringing on Massimo’s patents for blood oxygen monitoring in their watches.\n\nSeparately, according to a report from Bloomberg, Apple may face an antitrust lawsuit from the US Department of Justice, alleging the company leveraged software and hardware to assure iPhone dominance, as soon as March.\n\nYahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins the Live show to break down the latest developments with Apple.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nMADISON MILLS: Apple facing another legal setback over its patent dispute with Masimo over its watch. The federal appeals court refusing to grant Apple a longer pause on the watch import ban. Dan Howley has the latest for us as always. And Dan, thanks for joining us on this what does this mean for Apple? What do you anticipate the response from the company here?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah it looks like they're going to have to pull the Apple Watch again from store shelves and its online store in the US, at least as far as the Apple series 9 goes and the Apple Watch Ultra go. The Apple Watch SE will continue to be on sale. They had to do this originally just ahead of the holidays because of the issues that they're having with Masimo and the blood oxygen sensor.\n\nThen there was a chance for them to continue selling it. But now it looks like that appeal for them to extend that hold on the ban is now denied. So they'll have to once again pull them. Overall for Apple, it means that they're going to have to somehow come up with a way to remove the blood oxygen sensor. Apparently, they have something in the works. But it just isn't available right this moment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd so if they do have to pull them tomorrow or when they do pull them tomorrow, they're not going to have any new Apple Watches on the market. And that doesn't mean that you can't go to a Best Buy or Amazon or any of those places and buy. One you sure can. The issue is the import then at that point. You know, what happens if Apple tries to import more or if other companies try to import more?\n\nSo this is going to continue to be a problem for Apple until this whole blood oxygen sensor issue is sorted out. And we'll have to see if eventually they do start selling the Series 9 and Ultra without the feature completely.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And, Dan, that's one issue facing Apple. And then another is we're hearing these reports that Apple could be facing an antitrust trial perhaps as soon as March. What are you hearing on that front?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah. This is kind of a continuation of a earlier story that we had heard about Apple kind of facing this potential showdown with the DOJ. This one report is coming from Bloomberg about the March date. But really what's happening is the DOJ has been looking at Apple, their App Store practices, their software and hardware practices for some time, whether or not they exclude competitors from using their products and if that hurts competition in a way that would kind of rise to illegal in terms of antitrust laws.\n\nSo, you know, there's the concerns over whether or not they block the ability for companies to use for instance services like Apple Pay or the ability to access Apple Pay, hardware, the same with Find My. These are things that have come up quite regularly. There's also critics like Spotify and Tile, who complain about Apple blocking them out or making things harder for them.\n\nSo this is something that's been going on for quite some time. And it looks like now the DOJ may end up filing suit. Although, they haven't-- according to this report, they haven't finalized any decision yet.\n\nMADISON MILLS: Dan, thanks so much for walking us through that. And I should mention Apple down about half a percent after the close heading into tomorrow's market. Really appreciate you joining us on all things Apple always.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 10 best long-term tech stocks to buy. To skip our analysis of the tech industry and its recent trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Long-Term Tech Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe tech market is undergoing a significant transformation propelled by advancements in AI, data analytics, and cybersecurity. Among these, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands out as a potentially groundbreaking technological advancement, with Wall Street analysts drawing parallels to pivotal innovations like the internet. While there is a widespread consensus that AI will ultimately reshape the economy and boost corporate profits, there is vigorous debate regarding the timing and magnitude of these transformative and lucrative changes. Skeptics argue that especially in the stock market domain, the excitement surrounding AI may have surpassed actual developments, potentially leaving some highly valued stocks exposed to a decline in the event of an economic slowdown.\n\nDespite the initial decline in the NASDAQ during the early days of the year and the skepticism expressed by some circles regarding the Magnificent Seven's ability to sustain the gains observed in 2023, long-term analysts remain optimistic, believing that technology stocks have further potential for growth in 2024. During a recent appearance on CNBC, Josh Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, discussed the factors contributing to the decline in tech stocks in the first week of 2024. Brown attributed this decline to a significant amount of profit-taking activity currently underway, driven by the remarkable returns investors witnessed in the technology sector throughout 2023, particularly in the fourth quarter. The wealth manager also expressed an understanding of the rationale behind early-year profit-taking, given the spectacular rally in 2023. With that said, he emphasized that the downturn in tech stocks should not be misconstrued as these companies \"stumbling\"; rather, it is a result of strategic profit-taking.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the technology industry is poised for expansion as a growing number of companies show interest in joining the competition for AI and data analytics. Key industry players like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the best technology stocks that are achieving notable progress in the field and could potentially take the lead in seizing the considerable opportunities arising from future advancements.

Catherine D. Wood's ARK Investment Management emerged as a prominent shareholder for the quarter, holding a stake valued at $1.02 billion.\n\n7. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing firm that specializes in producing chips for major entities such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In November, the company delivered positive news to investors by reporting its first monthly increase in sales since February, driven by heightened demand for smartphones and AI.\n\nOn November 13, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) revealed a significant 34.8% month-over-month surge in its October net revenue, reaching nearly NT$243.2 billion, accompanied by a year-over-year growth of 15.7%, marking it as one of the best technology stocks to consider.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, 107 hedge funds held positions in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Fisher Asset Management emerged as the primary investor in the company, increasing its holdings to 30.637 million shares, valued at $2.66 billion.\n\nIn its third quarter 2023 investor letter, Bonsai Partners stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM):\n\n“Robustness at the product level exists differently than in other layers of the value chain. Product diversification follows the same principle, but product control isn’t related to vertical integration. Product control exists in multiple forms, such as switching costs or happy customers who don’t want to buy elsewhere. However, one often overlooked dimension of product-level robustness is adaptability. Some businesses offer goods and services that behave like shapeshifters; they naturally adapt to the market’s needs regardless of how the world changes. Adaptability also serves as a hedge against the unknown.\n\nConsider our investment in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), which enjoys a highly adaptive product portfolio. If we compare TSMC to a fabless chip maker like Qualcomm, investing in Qualcomm is a bet that its products will retain their technological advantage over time. Meanwhile, TSMC sells a service that naturally produces whatever the end customer wants. There is little need for brilliant product-level foresight; TSMC just needs to maintain its process and service level advantages, allowing it to manufacture whatever the market demands. TSMC’s product portfolio is robust compared to most other semiconductor companies because it naturally adapts to technological and market-driven shifts. Instead of product-level risk, TSMC’s core risks are geopolitical.”\n\n6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), commonly known as AMD, is a global semiconductor company headquartered in Santa Clara, California.

In August of the same year, AMD had also acquired Mipsology, an AI software company known for its expertise in providing AI solutions compatible with AMD adaptive computing silicon.\n\nOn November 13, investment advisory firm Roth MKM initiated coverage of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with a Buy rating and a price target of $125.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. previewed a new smart ring with sensors that the company hopes will vault them into deeper competition for health technology with Apple Inc. and others.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Milei’s Younger Sister Is Also ‘The Boss’ Directing His Mission\n\nThe company teased the device — called the Galaxy Ring — Wednesday at its Unpacked product launch event in San Jose, California. Samsung didn’t share many details about the product, but said it would include a slew of sensors and integrate with the company’s other devices such as the latest Galaxy S24 smartphones also introduced at the event.\n\nRead More: Samsung Bets on Google-Powered AI Features in Smartphone Revamp\n\nWhile smartwatches from Apple and Samsung have been the primary consumer entry point into health tracking in recent years, smart rings have grown in popularity. Oura Health Oy has become well-known with its health-tracking rings, while Apple has filed patents for similar devices.\n\n“They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” Tom Hale, Oura chief executive officer, said in an interview. “New players entering the space is validation for the category and drives us to aim higher to serve our members and community.”\n\nSamsung’s entry into the market will likely expand consumer interest in such products — and could push others into the competition. Amazon.com Inc. briefly sold a ring with a focus on taking Alexa voice commands, before discontinuing it in 2020 due to poor demand. That device didn’t include health features.\n\nSamsung didn’t say when the Galaxy Ring would be released, nor its price. Oura’s latest rings start at about $300.\n\nSamsung also announced new sleep analysis features based on artificial intelligence, including sleep apnea detection, for their smartwatches. Apple is working on a similar feature for this year, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung also is rolling out what it calls a Vitality Score, a metric designed to tell users how prepared they are for their day.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with comments from Oura in the fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Now for the Coming AI-Fueled Bull Market",
        "content": "Last year was booming for artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI became mainstream, and enterprises started making investments in the space. If you are wondering whether it is too late to invest, we are still in the early stages of adoption. This article discusses some AI stocks to buy that are central to this revolution.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, one-third of organizations already use AI in at least one of their business functions. Additionally, 40% plan to increase spending in this area. Already, leading companies are leveraging traditional and generative AI capabilities to drive productivity. These organizations attributed 20% of 2022 EBIT to using AI in business functions.\n\nGenerative AI has a lot of potential. According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) research, it could grow GDP by 7% annually in the next 10 years. The technology will automate tasks, streamline business workflows and enhance business applications.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToday, generative AI is applicable in business applications, drug development, software development and many more fields. The AI-fueled bull market will step up into high gear in 2024. These stocks to buy are leading the charge and are an integral part of the AI ecosystem.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nSurprisingly, one of the oldest technology companies is among the stocks that will benefit from AI. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been innovating in artificial intelligence for decades. Now, it’s bound to reap the rewards of its investments.\n\nThrough Watsonx, its AI and data platform, the company provides open-source models and IBM-curated and trained foundation models. What’s more, it offers a data store for gathering, training and cleansing data and an AI governance toolkit. All these capabilities enable clients to build and deploy specialized AI features across their enterprise.\n\nIBM has also embedded AI into its broad-based software portfolio. For instance, Watson Code Assistant delivers productivity gains for ITOps and DevOps teams. Furthermore, the company has integrated Watson technology with partners like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), Ernst & Young, Qualtrics and Sirion Labs.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, the consulting business is benefiting as organizations deploy more AI capabilities. IBM consultants are helping its customers deploy various generative AI solutions. IBM Consulting will be integral in scaling AI platforms and features in enterprises.\n\nNotably, the consulting segment has had four quarters of double-digit signing growth. As a result, the book-to-bill ratio has grown to 1.16. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is bullish and expects IBM’s consulting business to add $1 billion in revenues from AI. Due to the growing AI revenues, it remains one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

As has been evident for a few months, the company is an AI leader. While Apple has been quiet on AI, Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI and launched several products.\n\nThe Redmond-based software giant is among the best stocks to buy since it will benefit from increased enterprise spending on AI. According to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), CIOs expect a 3.3% IT budget growth in 2024. Of course, generative AI will be a key priority area due to huge productivity gains.\n\nMicrosoft will capture a significant share of this spending in various ways. First, Microsoft Azure has the best AI infrastructure for training and inference. Its services are available in over 60 data center regions worldwide. No other cloud provider covers more areas.\n\nAzure AI offers the best AI models from OpenAI and open-source models from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Hugging Face and others. Today, customers are using these models to develop their own AI applications. Due to the breadth of services and wide geographic reach, over 18,000 customers use Azure OpenAI services.\n\nAnother key area of Microsoft’s AI services has been improving productivity through copilots. The first service, GitHub Copilot, has become popular among developers since it increases productivity by over 55%. Microsoft 365 copilot is also seeing widespread adoption and could generate annual revenues of $10 billion by 2026.\n\nThe opportunities mentioned above elevate Microsoft as one of the best AI stocks to buy. As generative AI adoption grows, Microsoft will expand its AI customer base. Lastly, TipRanks analysts are bullish, with an average price target of $429, a possible 10% increase.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs cloud service providers increase data center spending in 2024 to meet AI/ML workloads needs, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) will benefit. The networking company is a key supplier to all major cloud service providers. Microsoft and Meta Platforms are large customers, accounting for about 42% of revenues in fiscal year 2022.\n\nTypically, AI workloads are compute and data-intensive, requiring computations distributed across thousands of GPUs. Therefore, the interconnect must deliver reliable performance, speed, scalability and interoperability. That is where Arista’s IP/Ethernet switches for GPU and Storage interconnects come into play.\n\nThe company provides the best ethernet solutions for AI networks. Its data center switches offer the best performance and low latency. Besides, Arista’s Universal Leaf and Spine design supports the interconnection of thousands of GPUs in large-scale AI applications.\n\nToday, Arista Networks is one of the top networking stocks to buy since its products are critical in building AI data centers. Its 7800R3 AI spine and 7060 AI leaf products are integral in optimizing networks and maximizing modern AI applications. Besides, Arista EOS, its Linux-based network operation system, provides the tools to achieve a high-bandwidth, low-latency, scalable, lossless and multi-tenant network.\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the company since its products are essential in building data centers to handle AI workloads. Their consensus estimates predict 33% revenue growth for 2023 and the momentum to continue in 2024. As major cloud service providers invest in more data centers to enhance their AI services, it’s one of the stocks that will get an AI boost.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Adds context from court decision in paragraph 2)\n\nBy Blake Brittain\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Apple Watches capable of reading blood-oxygen levels cannot be imported into the U.S. while Apple challenges a government decision that the devices infringe patents, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday.\n\nThe patents in question belong to medical technology company Masimo. The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit means the affected watches cannot be imported starting at 5 p.m. on Jan. 18 while Apple appeals the U.S. International Trade Commission's ban.\n\nSeparately, U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Jan. 12 determined that a proposed redesign from Apple would allow it to import reconfigured versions of its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches without violating the ITC's restrictions, court filings show.\n\nApple has not yet described the redesign publicly, which could involve an update to the watches' software.\n\nRepresentatives for Apple and Masimo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision.\n\nThe ITC's import ban on Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches briefly went into effect on Dec. 26. The Federal Circuit lifted the ban on Dec. 27 while it considered Apple's request for a long-term pause, and Apple resumed sales of the smartwatches later that day.\n\nMasimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology to use in Apple Watches. The ITC barred imports and direct Apple sales of Apple Watches that read blood-oxygen levels following a Masimo complaint.\n\nApple stopped selling its latest Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the U.S. before Christmas until the appeals court's temporary pause. The devices remained available from other U.S. retailers including Amazon.com, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart.\n\nApple asked the Washington-based Federal Circuit to keep the ban on hold for the duration of the appeals process, which is likely to take months. It argued that it was likely to win its appeal and that keeping the ban in effect would harm the company, its suppliers and the public.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe commission countered that Apple's arguments \"amount to little more\" than a patent infringer \"requesting permission to continue infringing.\"\n\nApple has included a pulse oximeter feature in smartwatches since its Series 6 Apple Watch in 2020.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has to stop selling its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches with a blood oxygen feature in the US, suffering another legal setback in its patent dispute with Masimo Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap China Population Extends Record Drop on Covid Deaths, Low Births China’s Economic Growth Disappoints, Fueling Stimulus Calls Trump Back in White House? Lagarde Says ‘Let Me Have Some Coffee’\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declined Wednesday to grant Apple a longer pause on an import ban of the devices imposed by the US International Trade Commission. The ruling means the company has to stop selling the watches with the oxygen measurement feature while an appeal of the ban plays out — a period that Apple believes could last a year or more.\n\nThe decision means Apple will probably have to turn to its backup plan: selling watches without the blood oxygen tool that was found to violate Masimo patents. Apple has developed a software workaround to the ban that eliminates the function from its devices. Last week, the US Customs and Border Protection agency approved redesigned versions of the watches that didn’t have the oxygen reader.\n\nThe court battle has threatened one of Apple’s biggest moneymakers in its home market, an unprecedented situation for the tech giant. The watches are a central piece of the company’s wearables, home and accessories division, a business that generated more than 10% of revenue last year, or nearly $40 billion.\n\nThe ITC ruled in October that Apple’s latest watches violate patents related to blood oxygen measurement. That led Apple to pause sales of the smartwatches just ahead of Christmas, though an interim stay allowed the company to bring the products back late last month.\n\nRead More: Apple Watch Saga Set in Motion by Late-Night Email to Cook\n\nAccording to the ITC, the harm Apple said it would face from the ban “is not unquantifiable, but rather speculative.” Apple maintains that the ruling from the ITC is erroneous and should be reversed.\n\nStory continues\n\nMasimo had urged the Federal Circuit to reject the request for an extended delay, arguing Apple had almost three years to anticipate a ban and “cannot complain about the consequences of its own failure to prepare for exclusion.”\n\nApple pushed back on the ITC’s and Masimo’s arguments that its ability to continue selling the non-infringing Apple Watch SE means any reputational harm from the ban can’t be truly irreparable.\n\nIt also criticized the product the trade dispute was launched to protect, Masimo’s W1 watch, saying it didn’t exist when Masimo filed its complaint, wasn’t placed in the consumer channel and is sold only in negligible quantities “well over two years after this investigation began on the false premise that Masimo had an established domestic industry.”\n\nThe appeals court said in a brief order Wednesday, “we reach no conclusion on the merits of the appeal.” The panel said the temporary stay will expire at 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday.\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, added the blood oxygen sensor to its watches in 2020 with the Series 6. Masimo, a medical device company, sued Apple that year, alleging that the iPhone maker violated several of its health technology patents and stole its trade secrets.\n\nThe case is Apple Inc. v.

        "title": "3 Gaming Stocks Leveling Up in 2024",
        "content": "Video games are a huge growth market. Younger generations have increasingly prioritized games over video and music, with the gaming industry and gaming stocks surpassing revenues from older media forms such as music and movies.\n\nAn industry boom, however, leads to intense competition. That has happened in spades in gaming. For example, on Steam, a popular PC gaming distribution platform, annual releases have risen from hundreds or a few thousand in the mid-2010s to more than 14,000 game releases in 2023.\n\nWhile gaming is an obvious long-term growth market, it is currently in a dip as record enthusiasm from 2021-2 has reverted toward more normalized levels. Which gaming stocks stand out in the current marketplace? These three are top industry picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity (NYSE:U) has had a rough couple of years. The graphics engine operator went public amid a great deal of investor enthusiasm.\n\nThe firm has roughly 70% market share as the game engine for mobile games. It also plays a significant role in console, PC and VR/AR game engine markets. In the early days of the pandemic, people were bored while stuck at home and sought new entertainment options.\n\nHowever, the video game industry experienced a sharp downturn in 2023, leading to over 9,000 layoffs industrywide—a figure far from prior years. Additionally, Unity tried to push through a major price increase to developers for licensing its engine but was forced to roll that back.\n\nNot surprisingly, U stock lingers far below its prior highs amid investor apathy. However, things are set to improve.\n\nThe gaming industry will likely pick back up in 2024 after last year’s trough. Meanwhile, Unity continues its cost-cutting, and management is laser-focused on improving its profitability. Unity still has a tremendous market position in an industry with long-term secular tailwinds. And Unity’s leading position in virtual reality, such as partnering with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on its Vision Pro, is another lever for upside going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nCD Projekt (OTGLY) image of someone playing video games to represent gaming stocks\n\nSource: korobskyph / Shutterstock.com\n\nCan a game publisher come back to life after an utterly disastrous game launch? Polish game developer CD Projekt (OTCMKTS:OTGLY) has answered that question in the affirmative.\n\nThe company was a well-respected developer of role-playing games. However, its Cyberpunk 2077 release was one of the most catastrophic in industry history. Falling far short of player expectations and releasing with an inordinate number of bugs and performance problems, Cyberpunk 2077 appeared set to become one of the biggest flops ever. Many investors understandably dumped CD Projekt stock and never looked back.\n\nHowever, CD Projekt deserves a second chance. The company worked tirelessly to fix the game with many patches and additional content releases. Furthermore, the company just released a widely praised expansion pack for the game Phantom Liberty. Despite Cyberpunk 2077’s abysmal product launch, it has turned around entirely and become a popular and respected title.\n\nCD Projekt’s masterful handling of this fraught situation should give investors confidence that the company can navigate the changing gaming market. And players are once again looking forward to whatever games the firm releases in the future.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft and Activision Blizzard logo on smartphone screen close-up\n\nSource: FellowNeko / Shutterstock.com\n\nA major characteristic of the gaming industry is the risk associated with individual developers. Particularly in big-budget triple-A games, it’s common for developers to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a single title. If it works, that’s great, but when those flop, it can cause whole studios to shut down.\n\nThe best way to counteract that risk is with scale. Increasingly, only the biggest developers can take massive risks given the industry’s changing structure.\n\nAnd there’s no bigger player than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company has a dominant place across the industry, developing games, selling consoles, offering subscription gaming services, etc. Microsoft’s unmatched resources give it access to the industry’s best talent and all the tools and levers to ensure its games stand out in a crowded marketplace.\n\nThat’s all been true for a while now. And it became doubly so following the firm’s recent $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. This gives Microsoft huge multiplayer gaming properties and a highly valuable intellectual property treasure trove. The gaming industry is rapidly changing, but there’s no doubt that Microsoft will remain a central player for many years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U stock.

        "title": "Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk",
        "content": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently briefly surpassed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the highest-valued company in the world; it has very sound management focused on shareholder returns, which is elicited in the financial statements. Its largest contributor to growth will likely be artificial intelligence, which places it in direct competition with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as a peer with the most advanced capabilities in the industry. Particularly, both companies are focusing on artificial intelligence integrations for retailers, creating tension over market share.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nWhile Microsoft has valuation risks, it remains a strong growth stock considering its operational strengths. However, its above-index returns are largely dependent on AI success, with considerable regulatory risks that could inhibit stock growth and create volatility. Nonetheless, the company remains one of the safer ways to gain exposure to AI.\n\nRetail AI operations and Google competition\n\nMicrosoft has introduced generative AI and data solutions for retailers, with a focus on personalized shopping experiences. A copilot template for Azure OpenAI Service assists with engaging customer interactions. As an example, Canadian Tire Corp. (CDNAF) is launching an AI shopping assistant to aid customers in purchasing automotive products.\n\nThe company is also integrating generative AI into tools used by store associates and managers with the intention of enhancing productivity and customer service. Voice-enabled task creation and real-time access to insights and information should further improve retail efficiencies.\n\nMicrosoft Fabric is a unified analytics platform for unlocking retail data, improving the planning and design of data solutions and driving forward AI-driven retail analytics.\n\nThe company is also integrating models of GPT-4 Turbo on Azure OpenAI Service, increasing the broad range of applications due to the partnership with OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo counter Microsoft's retail AI progress, Google Cloud has launched new GenAI products, which are aimed at personalizing online shopping experiences and making back-office operations more efficient. Conversational Commerce Solution and Catalog and Content Enrichment use advanced AI models to enhance engagement and automate content creation.\n\nAdditionally, Google introduced an AI Hypercomputer, which integrates software, hardware and machine learning. It improves productivity and efficiency and includes support for various machine learning tools such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Its recent launch of Gemini, a new AI model that is statistically the most advanced in the world right now, accompanied its AI Hypercomputer developments.\n\nBoth Microsoft and Google seem to be competing directly, but taking nuanced approaches to their respective projects. As such, the competitive risk to Microsoft is both arguably enhanced and reduced by Google's abilities, as larger traction in the AI market will drive awareness of Microsoft's tools as well. As I mentioned, statistically based on 30 out of 32 academic benchmarks, Gemini is above OpenAI's ChatGPT at current in terms of technical proficiencies.\n\nFinancial analysis\n\nMicrosoft is arguably strongest in the area of profitability, with industry-leading margins that should increase further as operational efficiencies get stronger due to AI. This is largely expected due to reduced headcount in specific sections of the business as automation takes over human labor. The company's net margin is 35.32% at the moment, which is better than 97.28% of companies in the software industry, according to GuruFocu' data. The gross margin is also an impressive 69.44%. Google has a net margin of 22.46%, significantly lower than Microsoft's, and Google's gross margin is only 55.88%. This positions Microsoft in a very strong position to invest further in advanced AI.\n\nFor its first quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported $56.5 billion in revenue, which is a 13% year-over-year increase. Its operating income was $26.9 billion, a 25% increase. Its net income was $22.3 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $2.99. Revenue for the company's Intelligent Cloud segment increased 19% year over year, with server products and cloud services revenue increasing 21% due to Azure; other cloud services growth was 29%. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment, largely responsible for its AI initiatives, is the greatest component of the organization's revenues: Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk\n\nMicrosoft's balance sheet is also quite strong, with 50.49% of its total assets balanced by total liabilities and 49.51% balanced by total equity for the last trailing 12 months. Total equity has risen from 31.96% in 2018, showing considerable financial prudence on the part of the management team. The company has also issued more debt in the last 12 months, with $22.515 billion in net issuance. However, its total cash flow from financing over the period is -$18.291 billion, largely due to dividend payments and stock repurchases, showing continued investment in shareholder returns.\n\nValuation concern\n\nThe largest weakness with an investment in Microsoft is its valuation, which is no surprise as it briefly became the world's most valuable company with a market cap of around $2.89 trillion, surpassing Apple's market cap of around $2.87 trillion. Microsoft has a forward price-earnings ratio of around 35, compared to Apple's ratio of 28 and Google's ratio of 21.\n\nAssuming Microsoft maintains its strong annual earnings per share without NRI growth rates, which have increased from 17.50% as a 12-year average to 22% as a five-year average and 19.40% as a three-year average, the stock could be considered moderately overvalued at present based on my discounted cash flow calculation. By taking a moderate estimate of a 19% annual earnings per share without NRI growth rate for the next 10 years, which I think is conservative but would price in inhibitions such as regulatory constraints on progress in AI, the fair value of the stock is around $336, approximately a 15.5% downside on the current stock price of around $388.\n\nThe discounted cash flow analysis assumes a 4% growth rate for a 10-year terminal stage following the 19% growth period and a 10% discount rate. Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk\n\nBy a different method, the GF Value chart shows the stock to be fairly valued, and so investors must realize they are not allocating capital to undervalued shares, but instead to a high-growth enterprise that particularly shines on profitability and has operational strengths already priced in. Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk\n\nRisks\n\nThe company might see significant inhibition to its earnings and revenue growth if regulatory hurdles slow down retail AI operations. In addition, there are severe security risks associated with the transfer and collection of data crucial to advanced AI practices in retail and other workplaces. As a company focused intently on artificial intelligence for its continued growth, I think investors should expect periods of slower growth as markets accustom themselves to new technologies related to AI. Microsoft will potentially be at the forefront of case studies related to policy and regulation in jurisdictions around the world.\n\nIn addition, even if the stock is fairly valued, this means there is no margin of safety if the AI industry performs less promising than expected. The hopes and estimates for the industry are well-founded, and Grand View Research estimates an annual growth rate of 37.3% for the sector from 2023 to 2030. By 2030, the AI market is projected to be worth over $1.3 trillion, but some volatility on the way to this high estimate is likely and should be expected, in my opinion.\n\nConclusion\n\nI think Microsoft is one of the most stable ways to gain exposure to AI, particularly as it is also diversified beyond these operations. The company's venture into retail AI and its partnership with OpenAI make a strong foundation to compete with Google to become the dominant player in the field. Its financials are sound with exceptional margins and the main real risk to consider is a potentially overvalued stock. My rating for the stock is buy.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "By Joyce Lee\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics latest premium smartphones, unveiled on Wednesday, will have multiple AI functions, such as simultaneous translation of foreign language phone calls, in the company's latest push to challenge Apple.\n\nApple topped Samsung in 2023 smartphone shipments, according data provider International Data Corporation, dethroning Samsung for the first time since 2010 as demand for premium devices - a segment Apple dominates - outpaces market growth.\n\nIn response, Samsung is offering various artificial intelligence functions in its premium Galaxy S24 models as part of its strategy to attract buyers.\n\nThe new phones will have two-way voice translation in real-time of a live phone call conducted in two different languages, which the company said the Galaxy S24 series is the first ever smartphone to offer.\n\nAvailable in 13 different languages, the on-device AI function is offered via Samsung's own generative AI training.\n\nIt also offers a \"circle-to-search\" function in which circling any part of an image on screen searches it in Google. Other features include AI translation and changing the tone of messages to casual, formal, business or social media.\n\nThere are also AI summaries and translation of voice recordings, \"generative editing\" of photos that fill in non-existent backgrounds, and a feature that turns real-time videos into slow-motion by filling in non-existent frames with AI.\n\nOn-device AI refers to generative AI functions that are downloaded to each user's device after being trained, which do not need to connect to the cloud.\n\nCompanies like Qualcomm and Samsung are touting on-device AI as more secure for personal information, as it does not need to send data to the cloud for use.\n\nAI SMARTPHONES\n\nJust 5% of smartphones shipped in 2024 will be AI-capable, but this will grow to 45% in 2027, data provider Canalys forecasts.\n\nIn the long-term, \"generative AI on devices is bound to have a significant impact on the smartphone market, especially in terms of user experience,\" said Jene Park, Senior Analyst at Counterpoint.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, this might not \"immediately affect smartphone purchases\", Park added, as it takes time for generative AI functions to incorporate more and better data to increase value for consumers.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 series will be sold starting Jan 31.\n\nIn the United States, the base Galaxy S24 will be priced from $799 and two higher-specification versions, the S24 Plus and S24 Ultra, from $999 and $1,299, respectively.\n\nSamsung has kept the prices of the base model and Plus at the same level as last year's. The price of the Ultra has been increased by $100.\n\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee. Editing by Jane Merriman)",

        "title": "Samsung Bets on Google-Powered AI Features in Smartphone Revamp",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is turning to artificial intelligence features to revamp its flagship Galaxy smartphones, betting that the technology can give it an advantage over Apple Inc.’s iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap China Population Extends Record Drop on Covid Deaths, Low Births JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Trump Back in White House? Lagarde Says ‘Let Me Have Some Coffee’\n\nAt its Unpacked conference Wednesday in San Jose, California, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra phones, which all add AI tools based on the Gemini technology from Alphabet Inc.’s Google. The devices can live-translate phone calls, transcribe voice recordings, summarize web articles, fix handwriting and use generative AI to fill in parts of photos.\n\nThe launch is one of the most ambitious attempts to weave AI into a smartphone’s interface and features. The new devices also provide Google with a chance to put its most advanced software in the hands of more users, a potential edge in its fight for AI dominance with Microsoft Corp. and startup OpenAI.\n\nThe AI features are the highlight of the new phones, but the devices are also getting slimmer bezels and brighter displays. Samsung is paying special attention to its top-end model, the S24 Ultra. That product, which starts at $1,299, will have a new titanium frame, matching the iPhone 15 Pro models released in September.\n\nThe borders around the displays are 42% thinner, and the screen is 40% brighter than the phone’s predecessor. It also sports flatter edges and a front-facing camera cutout that’s 11% smaller.\n\nThe $799 S24 and $999 S24+ come in aluminum and get slightly larger screens than their predecessors, moving from 6.1-inch and 6.6-inch panels to 6.2-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The S24 Ultra, like the S23 Ultra, has a 6.8-inch screen.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm Inc. is providing the main chip of the new Samsung phones in at least some regions. The S24 lineup will be based on its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 applications processor, the company said in a separate statement. That component offers the latest Wi-Fi capabilities and will handle AI-assisted features such as live translation and transcription, Qualcomm said.\n\nThe new models come at a crucial time for Samsung, which is contending with market share losses and a broader smartphone slump. Last year, it lost its crown as the No. 1 smartphone supplier to Apple, marking the first time Samsung hasn’t led the market since 2010.\n\nSamsung’s phone shipments declined nearly 14% to 226.6 million units in 2023, according to research firm IDC. Apple, on the other hand, saw unit shipments increase 3.7% to 234.6 million.\n\nSamsung looks to reverse its fortunes by getting a several-month head start on AI. Apple isn’t expected to showcase its latest plans for artificial intelligence until June, ahead of new iPhones arriving around September. The new Galaxy phones come out on Jan. 31, with preorders starting Wednesday.\n\nRead More: Apple Faces AI, China, App Store Challenges in 2024\n\nSamsung decided to adopt the Gemini AI technology after surveying offerings from competitors, according to Thomas Kurian, head of Google’s cloud computing unit. As part of a multiyear agreement, Google will be the sole provider of generative AI for Samsung’s phones and applications, including features for taking notes and recording audio, according to Kurian.\n\n“This is a validation of the quality of our models,” Kurian said. “They were free to choose whoever they wanted.”\n\nUsers will be able to switch between two options: one called Gemini Nano that runs on the phone itself and a higher-powered Pro version that uses cloud computing. That flexibility helped Google’s offerings stand out from the competition, Kurian said.\n\nIn conjunction with Samsung’s announcements, Google also introduced a feature called “Circle to Search,” which lets people search anything on their phone screens without switching apps. Users of Google’s Android operating system can scribble or circle on top of images, text or video in the app they’re on – say, YouTube Shorts or TikTok – to find out more information about the item. The feature is launching globally on the new Galaxy S24, as well as on Google’s own Pixel 8 smartphones on Jan. 31.\n\nAI features on the Samsung devices will also let users change the language of a message depending on the context, such as whether it’s a work memo or social media post. And new capabilities for Android Auto — Google’s in-car interface — will summarize incoming text messages and other alerts.\n\nThe companies are also applying AI to the phones’ camera systems, which are getting upgraded with new sensors, with tools to make photos sharper. The S24 Ultra replaces one of its 10-megapixel telephoto cameras with a 50-megapixel version. The S24 and S24+, meanwhile, include the same camera specifications as their predecessors.\n\nThe S24 Ultra comes with as much as 1 terabyte of storage, while the S24+ tops out at 512 gigabytes. The S24 has as much as 256GB of space. The S24+ and S24 Ultra include 12GB of memory, which is used for shorter-term storage of data, while the regular S24 has 8GB.\n\n--With assistance from Ian King and Yoolim Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal Patti LaBelle Moves From Stage to Stove With a Recipe for Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Unveiling The Secrets: How Warren Buffett Gained $10 Billion In 2023",
        "content": "Renowned investor Warren Buffett added nearly $12 billion to his net worth in 2023. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) rose by nearly 15% over the past year, driving up Buffett's net worth in 2023.\n\nIn the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Buffett repurchased approximately $1.1 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway's shares. In the first nine months of last year, Berkshire Hathaway repurchased approximately $7 billion worth of shares.\n\nBuffett, also known as the Oracle of Omaha, is the sixth-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $120.6 billion, according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. His net worth was around $108 billion by the end of December 2022.\n\nJapanese Equities: The Gateway to Buffett's Success\n\nDespite the skyrocketing inflation levels over the past few years, Japan kept its benchmark interest rate at negative 0.1%, a sharp contrast to the U.S. interest rates, which are hovering near 22-year highs.\n\nIdentifying an arbitrage opportunity, Buffett has been pumping capital into Japanese equities and bonds. He owns more Japanese stocks than any other stocks outside of the U.S. As of mid-November 2023, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately $827 million worth of Japanese yen-denominated bonds.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway also maintains a 7.4% stake each in five sogo shosha companies in Japan, namely, Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsui Group and Sumitomo Corp.\n\n\"They are really so much similar to Berkshire. They own a lot of different things,\" Buffett said in an interview with Nikkei Asia.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend Income And Investment Gains\n\nBuffett is a long-time advocate of dividend-paying blue-chip stocks. He is expected to have earned more than $6 billion in dividend income in 2023, thanks to his sizable stakes in Bank of America Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. stock. Buffett also bought over 10 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) in December, bringing his total stake to nearly 27%.\n\nIn the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway posted a $24.1 billion investment loss, primarily because of a decline in Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price.\n\n\"The amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings (losses) per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules,\" Berkshire Hathaway said in a statement.\n\nApple stock rose by 49% in 2023, outperforming the benchmark Nasdaq Composite Index's 44% surge last year.\n\nInsurance Payoff And Yield Income\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's operating earnings rose by over 40% year over year to $10.76 billion in the third quarter. This can be attributed to a surge in auto insurance company Geico's profit margins, which Buffett touts as the \"crown jewel\" of his empire. Geico's underwriting income crossed $1.1 billion in the third quarter.\n\nBuffett also capitalized on the rise in bond yields by acquiring short-term Treasury bills with yields of at least 5% last year. By the conclusion of the third quarter, the conglomerate possessed $126.4 billion in such investments, a notable increase from the approximately $93 billion held at the end of the previous year.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "title": "10 Small-Cap Energy Stocks with Strong Returns",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at ten small-cap energy stocks with strong returns. If you want to skip our overview of small cap investing and the energy sector, then you can take a look at the 5 Small-Cap Energy Stocks with Strong Returns.\n\nWhen it comes to trading stocks, there are several sectors that an investor can target depending on strategy. Primarily, stocks can be divided between small caps and large caps on the basis of their market capitalization. Stocks with a market capitalization lower than $2 billion are small caps and all others are large caps. Of course, there are other stock categorizations based on market capitalization as well. For instance, within the small cap stock segment, those stocks that have a market value lower than $300 million are called micro cap stocks and those valued lower than $50 million are nano caps. Similarly, stocks valued between $2 billion and $2 billion are mid caps, followed by large caps and mega caps such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and of course, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nContinuing with our initial categorization of all stocks into either large cap or small cap allows a deeper look at the merits and demerits of investing in both. Large cap stocks, and particularly the mega caps and well footed oil companies and stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), are preferred and suitable when the economy is in trouble. This is because even though mega oil cap stocks generally trend lower if economic growth is stuttering, their fortress balance sheets provide investors with security in knowing that once the macroeconomic clouds have dissipated, the company will still be there to meet any uptick in demand.\n\nSimilarly, small cap stocks tend to fare better when an economy is growing. This is because these companies benefit from broader economic health through larger markets for their products and services. At the same time, a stable economy means that small cap stocks and businesses can meet their payroll, investor, and debt obligations - all three of which are broader and lead indicators of a company's financial stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nSwitching gears, the oil industry is entering 2024 on a rather tepid note. The start of 2023 saw a lot of optimism all around as investors expected global economies to continue a post coronavirus recovery. Yet, after touching record high revenue levels in, the oil industry took a breather last year.\n\n2023 was a year of consolidation in the energy industry as mega firms announced historic deals. In October 2023, Exxon got the ball rolling as it announced a bumper $59.5 billion price tag to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) for a price of $253 per share. The Pioneer acquisition is Exxon's biggest such move this millennium, and it will allow the biggest Western oil supermajor to increase its production on America's Permian Basin. Given Exxon's size, it's only natural that a multi billion dollar acquisition catches eyes. Right now, it's the eyes of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that are on the deal, with FTC requesting more data at the start of December. Democratic senators have raised concerns about the deal affecting prices that consumers pay for gas, but anti trust experts believe that the FTC could see the merger happen anyway since both Exxon and Pioneer are oil producers instead of marketing companies.\n\nIn the energy industry, where there's Exxon there's Chevron and this is also the case for 2023's mega oil deals. Soon after Exxon announced its Pioneer acquisition, Chevron also stepped up to reveal that it will acquire the New York based oil and gas exploration and production firm Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES). With a price tag of $53 billion, the deal is believed to provide Chevron with crucial access to offshore drilling projects in Guyana that have also seen Exxon receive flak for. However, while Exxon's deal benefits from the political stability in America, Guyana is part of the region that has seen increased political volatility as of late. The British military has deployed a warship to Guyana, and Venezuela's new president is also sending the military to the region due to mega oil discoveries. At the same time, the FTC has also requested Chevron and Hess for more information, so their share prices and geopolitical news should be important factors to watch out for in oil stocks in 2024.\n\nAs for Chevron, its CEO Michael Wirth sounded optimistic about the Hess deal in October when he stated:\n\nBut I was out in a number of meetings with John Hess, sometimes the larger Hess shareholders, sometimes with larger Chevron shareholders. I would say, in general, people see the long-term value proposition very clearly here. And I think they see it as a combined company that is stronger and one that is set up to be stronger for longer with the ability to really sustain cash distributions to shareholders in a very consistent, predictable and durable fashion long into the future. And so that is, there’s no doubt about that. Some of the questions, on the one side, did you get a high enough price? On the other side, did you pay too much, right?\n\nSo there was tension in the [inaudible] in that, to be honest, during the negotiation. It was [inaudible] as we mentioned, this has been going on for some time. And John and I have been looking for a way to do a deal that is actually one that’s good for both sets of shareholders and not easy because it’s a great asset and the market recognizes that value. And so I think you can find nuances from people who either held one of the stocks or the other for certain reasons. And maybe this wasn’t exactly what they expected. But broadly speaking, I would say people see the long-term value creation. They see the transparency to resource depth, to production growth. The fact that you now have [inaudible] with Hess, you’ve got a much more diversified set of assets attached to their portfolio, which derisks any one of those assets.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some small cap energy stocks with strong returns. The top three stocks with the highest returns in this list are NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NGL), Prairie Operating Co. (NASDAQ:PROP), and Geospace Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:GEOS). 10 Small-Cap Energy Stocks with Strong Returns\n\nA close-up shot of a large pipeline pumping crude oil and pipe valves in a petroleum trust.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the small cap stocks with the strongest returns, we ranked all small cap energy stocks (those with a market capitalization lower than $2 billion) with their 12 month share price performance. Out of these, the top ten small cap energy stocks with the highest returns were chosen. The list is not all inclusive by any means.\n\nFor these stocks we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Small-Cap Energy Stocks with Strong Returns\n\n10. North American Construction Group Ltd.

        "title": "My 2 Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks didn't get that moniker for no reason. It refers to a group of tech companies that have historically delivered market-crushing returns and could continue to do so. No doubt, every single one of them is worth some consideration, and in my view, most have a place in most investors' portfolios.\n\nHowever, two of these corporations, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), are my favorites, although they are very close. Let's consider why these two tech juggernauts are excellent forever stocks.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple's market cap is inching closer to $3 trillion, and the company's biggest growth driver in the past 15 years, namely the iPhone, has lost traction. To be clear, the iPhone continues to generate tens of billions in sales every year for Apple and remains its largest category in terms of revenue. But it simply doesn't drive the same kind of top-line growth that it once did.\n\nMany investors are skeptical of Apple's future, but the company can still deliver market-beating returns. For one, Apple has a history of developing newer, better technological devices, often adding tweaks to existing gadgets. They won't all be as successful as the iPhone, but investors can expect more gems from the tech giant along those lines.\n\nSecond, Apple is increasingly relying on its services segment. The opportunities here are nearly limitless: Thanks to an installed base of more than 2 billion devices, Apple can offer a range of services, from video and audio streaming to healthcare and fintech. Nothing stops the company from adding new options, and that's precisely what it has historically done.\n\nApple's services business also generates much higher margins than the rest of its operations, so as it becomes a larger part of its revenue, it will work wonders for its bottom line. Third, Apple has a strong competitive advantage that stems from its brand name -- one of the most valuable in the world -- and switching costs. Those who join Apple's ecosystem of interconnected devices and services find it difficult to leave for fear of having to deal with such troublesome things as having to migrate valuable data.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple consistently ranks among the top companies in terms of customer loyalty for a reason. Last but not least, Apple pays a dividend. In the past 10 years, it has raised its payouts by 120%. Reinvesting dividends will help boost long-term returns for those who choose to do so. Apple may no longer offer the kinds of returns it did in the 2010s, but that's an incredibly high bar for any company.\n\nStill, the tech giant should remain a leader in its field for a long time and continue delivering above-average returns.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, has also had its detractors. Its advertising revenue dropped for some time due to economic pressure, and the company saw its profits squeezed by heavy investment in its Reality Labs segment. However, Meta Platforms turned the corner last year. The company decreased expenses while benefiting from a rebound in the advertising market.\n\nRevenue increased, profits jumped, and the stock performed exceptionally well in 2023. Here's what that tells us about Meta Platforms' prospects. While it is susceptible to the whims of the economy -- as are many successful corporations -- the company's business is strong enough to handle them. One of Meta Platforms' most important assets is that it boasts 3.96 billion monthly active users across its websites and apps.\n\nThat's about half of the human population that visits at least one of Meta's websites at least once a month and about 3.14 billion who do so daily. Furthermore, the company benefits from a competitive advantage as well, mainly from the network effect. Want to catch up and share pictures with friends and family? Going to a website that already has a large number of users, such as Instagram, is a great option. And the more people who join the platform, the more attractive it becomes.\n\nMeta has also been ramping up new monetization initiatives. The company's Reels (short-form videos across Facebook and Instagram designed to compete with TikTok) is soaring in popularity, while paid messaging on WhatsApp is also delivering excellent results. The company is also making a push in artificial intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms hasn't given up on its metaverse idea, although that likely won't yield any significant return on investment soon. Still, it is another potential long-term opportunity for the company. E-commerce is another obvious growth opportunity for Meta Platforms, given its large ecosystem. Meta should soon rejoin the trillion-dollar club, but that won't mark the end of the company's growth journey.\n\nThat story still has plenty of chapters left. Investors can buy the stock, sit back, and enjoy the ride.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is continuously bolstering its Google TV capabilities with new feature updates to capitalize on the growth opportunities present in the global smart streaming devices market. Per a Statista report, the global smart streaming devices market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.7% during the forecast period of 2023-2030.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company announced the availability of a new audio switcher for Google TV in the upcoming months.\r\n\r\nThis new feature, set to be present in Google TV's Quick Settings option, will enable users to switch between Bluetooth headphones and TV speakers without navigating to the full Settings menu.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid traction across smart TV users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nMore on Google TV\n\nApart from the latest announcement, Google introduced a new \"Call notifications\" option on Google TV, enabling select apps to send calls to the TV and allowing users to toggle on and off this feature in the Settings app.\r\n\r\nAlphabet expanded its Google TV content portfolio by adding a slew of apps and services like ABC, Amazon’s AMZN Prime Video, Apple’s AAPL Apple TV+, AMC and Kocowa, among others.\r\n\r\nAlso, the company extended its Google TV services to several other regions, including Brazil, France, Germany and Japan, among others.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will strengthen the company’s Google TV offerings. This, in turn, is expected to aid the Google Services segment’s performance, which has been a key growth driver for the company. Alphabet shares have gained 56.1% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 45.1%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.7% in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nAlphabet’s growing efforts to boost its Google TV offerings will enable this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to compete well against some notable industry players like Apple, Amazon and Roku ROKU, which are also making concerted efforts to gain a solid footing in the streaming devices market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Apple revealed a selection of immersive original stories for Apple TV+ using Apple Immersive Video, which will be available in the Apple TV app on Apple Vision Pro on February 2.\r\n\r\nFurther, Apple introduced the Zoom video conferencing app to its Apple TV 4K. The app, known as “Zoom for Home TV,” utilizes iOS' Continuity Camera feature for meetings, offering calendar integration and easy-to-access shortcuts for upcoming meetings on Apple TV.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Amazon is enjoying the growing momentum of its Fire TV line-up.\r\n\r\nAmazon partnered with Panasonic to combine Fire TV's personalized streaming experience and Alexa access with Panasonic's top-of-the-line smart TVs for global customers, boosting its smart streaming device offerings.\r\n\r\nRoku, on the other hand, is expanding its smart streaming device offerings with new feature updates for Roku TV.\r\n\r\nRoku introduced user-friendly features for Roku TV in its 'What to Watch' section, including 'Recommendations,' 'Save Lists' and 'Continue Watching.'

        "content": "By Una Galani and Peter Thal Larsen\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 17 (Reuters) - India is eyeing $100 billion in annual foreign direct investment (FDI) \"in the next few years\", its IT minister said on Wednesday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to attract investors ahead of a reelection bid.\n\n\"We see 6-8% consistent growth rate over the next full decade, and this is based on a very clearly thought-out strategy. This strategy has four major engines,\" Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw also told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nHe listed the four engines as investment in infrastructure,- both physical and digital, lifting up those at the bottom pyramid of the population, boosting manufacturing, and simplifying processes underlying ease of doing business.\n\nForeign investors have bet big on India since Modi came to power in 2014, with the likes of Apple, Samsung , Kia, and Airbus expanding operations.\n\nThis investment has come despite criticism from some executives who say Modi's protectionist policies in sectors such as digital payments, manufacturing and e-commerce often promote local businesses to the disadvantage of foreign companies.\n\nIndia attracted FDI inflows of $33 billion in the first six months of the current financial year that started in April 2023. It recorded FDI of $71 billion in the 2022-23 financial year.\n\nIndia expects its economy to grow by 7.3% in this financial year, the highest rate of any of the major global economies, but it still has large numbers of unemployed young people - a key issue in the upcoming elections.\n\nVaishnaw compared hitting $100 billion with the inflows China attracted annually over more than a decade, adding investors now see India as the \"most important investment destination\".\n\nVaishnaw has been overseeing India's push to be a powerhouse in electronics manufacturing, a key plank of Modi's business agenda.\n\nIndia is continuously engaging with Apple to boost that company's manufacturing and retail presence in the country, Vaishnaw said. India is currently estimated to account for about 12-14% of global iPhone shipments.\n\n(Reporting by Una Galani and Peter Thal Larsen, Additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya; Writing by Munsif Vengattil Editing by Gareth Jones)",

        "content": "Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed lower during Tuesday’s session.\n\nApple is looking to cut prices on its iPhones in China by as much as 500 yuan ($70) amid increasing competition in the Chinese market, according to Reuters.\n\nThe tech giant, meanwhile, has potentially sidestepped an import ban that loomed over its latest Apple Watch models stemming from a patent infringement dispute with medical technology firm Masimo Corporation, according to a recent report.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.52%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,147,688 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $229,538 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nAlso Read: Top 4 Consumer Stocks That May Collapse This Month\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nStory continues\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 1.2% to close at $183.63 on Tuesday.\n\nRead More: Real estate crowdfunders are cropping up quickly, but one Jeff Bezos-backed platform is pulling ahead.

        "title": "61% of Warren Buffett-Led Berkshire Hathaway's $360 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 3 Top Consumer Brands",
        "content": "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett values a company that has a strong brand. Brand power can help a business rely on customer loyalty to generate recurring revenue, and it can also give a business the ability to raise prices amid inflation. By investing in businesses with strong consumer brands, investors can put themselves in great positions to achieve excellent returns in the long run.\n\nIn Buffett-led company Berkshire Hathaway, the following three stocks account for over 61% of the portfolio: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), American Express (NYSE: AXP), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). And they all have one important thing in common: strong consumer brands.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple has long been a favorite company of Buffett's, and it's the top holding in Berkshire Hathaway, accounting for 47.1% of the portfolio. The company has built a strong brand over the years through its iPads and iPhones, and expanded that into other services, such as music and streaming.\n\nBy growing its ecosystem, it becomes easier for the business to grow its top line, even while other companies may be struggling. In its most recent fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2023, Apple's net sales totaled $383.3 billion, which were down a relatively modest 2.8% year over year. But services revenue, which makes up 22% of the top line, rose by more than 9%.\n\nIt has been an impressive performance for Apple given the financial pressure on consumers over the past few years. The stock has been an outstanding buy over the past decade, generating returns of over 850% for investors. And that's a trend that's not likely to subside anytime soon. Apple remains a good option for long-term investors.\n\n2. American Express\n\nCredit card giant American Express is another strong brand that resonates with consumers. The brand is particularly popular with affluent customers, which can help add some safety to the business by potentially reducing the risk of default.\n\nThe business has been doing well of late, which is further evidence of its customers resiliency; revenue net of interest expense through the first nine months of 2023 totaled $44.7 billion and was up 16% year over year, while net income of $6.4 billion jumped by 8%. The company is also showing strong growth among younger customers -- Millennial and Gen Z customers remain its fastest-growing cohorts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express stock's returns over the past decade aren't nearly as impressive as Apple's, with gains of around 109%, but this is another example of a solid consumer brands stock that investors can build their portfolios around. It accounts for 7.6% of Berkshire's portfolio today.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nAnother beloved Buffett stock is Coca-Cola. It accounts for 6.7% of Berkshire's portfolio, and is yet another example of a versatile consumer brand. Through its strong branding power, Coca-Cola has been able to lean on price increases over the past year to help grow its business and offset the impact of inflation.\n\nFor 2023, the company is expecting its organic revenue growth rate to come in between 10% and 11%. That's an impressive growth rate for the business given the current macroeconomic challenges all over the world. During the first nine months of the year, changes in pricing and product mix have generated 10% revenue growth for Coca-Cola. Meanwhile, there has also been a 1% increase in volume (concentrate sales), which is impressive given the company's price hikes.\n\nCoca-Cola's strong brand has enabled the company to weather the storm over the past year by relying on price increases. Although the stock's 10-year returns of 52% may appear unimpressive, risk-averse investors will love the stock for the safety it offers, plus its high dividend, which yields over 3%.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "We are in the initial stage of the fourth-quarter 2024 earnings season. The earnings results and management guidance would be crucial for market participants to gauge the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nAs of Jan 12, 29 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their financial numbers. Total earnings for these index members are up 7.6% from the same period last year on 6% higher revenues, with 93.1% beating EPS estimates and 55.2% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt present, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index in fourth-quarter 2024 are expected to be up 0.1% on 2.2% higher revenues. This follows the 3.8% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues in the third quarter and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings before that.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of Dow stocks — popularly known as blue-chip stocks — with a favorable Zacks Rank are set to beat on earnings results. Investment in these stocks should be prudent going forward.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Dow stocks that are poised to beat on earnings results. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings releases. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the last quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple Inc. AAPL is benefiting from strong demand for iPhone. AAPL expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAAPL expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. For the Services segment, AAPL expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Apple has an Earnings ESP of +3.65%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.2% for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nApple recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.5%. The company is set to release earnings results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.\n\nThe Boeing Co. BA remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.\n\nA strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost BA’s Defense, Space & Security's segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term. Our model projects BA's total revenues to increase in 2023-2025 time period.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Boeing has an Earnings ESP of +0.33%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.9% over the last 30 days. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Co. KO continues to witness positive business trends as reflected by its robust surprise history. KO’s sales and earnings beat estimates for the third consecutive quarter in third-quarter 2023. Strong revenue growth across most of its operating segments aided by improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales boosted the results.\n\nKO is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. KO provided upbeat guidance for 2023. We anticipate organic revenue growth of 10% for 2023. We expect positive price/mix of 9.3% and an increase of 1.5% in concentrate volume for 2023.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Coca-Cola has an Earnings ESP of +1%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 90 days.\n\nCoca-Cola recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 5.1%. The company is set to release earnings results on Feb 13, before the opening bell.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Co. PG has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. PG has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.\n\nThis led to the top and bottom lines beating the consensus mark for the fifth consecutive quarter in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consequently, PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view. We estimate all-in sales to increase 3.7% year over year in fiscal 2024.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Procter & Gamble has an Earnings ESP of +0.48%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 8.8% for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 90 days.\n\nProcter & Gamble recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.8%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 23, before the opening bell.\n\nThe Travelers Companies Inc. TRV boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, a rise in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.\n\nTRV’s commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. TRV remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth at auto and homeowners business. TRV expects fixed-income net investment income to be around $615 million after tax for the fourth quarter.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Travelers Companies has an Earnings ESP of +1.56%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 51.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.

        "content": "Warren Buffett is known for his long-term investing style. Today, Legendary investor  -- nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha -- holds dozens of stocks via his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nI've gone through Berkshire's many holdings to determine what makes a stock worth holding forever. After all, forever is a long time! It turns out, though, that there are some clues. For instance, Buffett often tends to favor consumer stocks. You'll notice that they all:\n\nGrow for decades (even if they occasionally hit setbacks). Sell things consumers buy repeatedly. Have colossal market opportunities.\n\nHere are five Buffett stocks you can buy and hold without losing sleep.\n\n1. Apple\n\nNaturally, Berkshire's largest holding kicks this list off. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is 47% of the portfolio. It didn't start that way, but Apple's strong performance since 2016 (when Buffett bought) made it that way, and Buffett has held the shares throughout all the success. The iPhone maker is arguably the world's most prominent company today. Over 2 billion people use iOS devices worldwide. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThat customer base creates tremendous, though sometimes lumpy, revenue and profits as consumers buy new phones or devices and subscribe to various services, like Apple Music, Cloud, and more. Consumers do so much on their phones that it gives Apple additional growth opportunities in new categories like artificial intelligence, telehealth, and fintech in the future.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBuffett isn't always in stocks as early as he should be. After all, nobody is perfect. E-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is an example of Buffett missing the early upside in a big winner. He bought his first shares in 2019, a position that's just 0.4% of Berkshire's holdings.\n\nHowever, there is still a lot to be excited about with Amazon. It's the dominant e-commerce business in America, holding a 38% market share. It's also the world's leading cloud platform, with 32% of that industry.\n\nStory continues AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNot only are e-commerce and cloud computing big markets that can still expand for years, but Amazon is actively setting up new growth opportunities, a mindset instilled by founder Jeff Bezos. Amazon is jumping into media and advertising with both feet. Its Prime membership has over 200 million members and broadcasts entertainment content and live sports via the National Football League on Prime Video. So many irons in the fire make future growth highly likely.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) needs little introduction. It's one of the world's most widely recognized brands and has been a core holding in Berkshire's portfolio since the late 1980s. Today, the stock is Berkshire's fourth-largest holding at 6.7%. It's also a testament to dividend stocks. Berkshire receives a whopping $736 million in dividends from Coca-Cola each year. KO Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCoca-Cola isn't a growth stock, but the business is growing. It's a simple recipe. Take a product portfolio with hundreds of beverage brands sold in virtually every country on Earth. Coca-Cola's products are in stores, vending machines, restaurants -- virtually everywhere they can be.\n\nFactor in slow population growth, new product launches and acquisitions, and price increases, and you get decades of growth and investment returns. It's as simple as that.\n\n4. Diageo\n\nSticking with the beverage industry, Buffett also went to the other side of the aisle, to the alcohol business. Diageo(NYSE: DEO) is a conglomerate that owns several household alcohol brands, including Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Captain Morgan, Baileys, Smirnoff, and more. In all, Diageo is doing over $20 billion in annual sales.\n\nAlcohol falls into a category often called sin stocks. It's not good for you, but people have been drinking to alleviate stress and have a good time for thousands of years. DEO Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's not a massive investment by Buffett's standards. Berkshire allocates just $32 million to Diageo stock, making it a rounding error in Berkshire's portfolio. But if you're looking for a company that's as certain to be around in 100 years as any, Diageo is an outstanding stock to take a look at today.\n\n5. American Express\n\nLastly, Buffett has benefited from how much Americans love spending money. Credit card company American Express(NYSE: AXP) has resided in Berkshire's portfolio since the early 1990s, and it's grown to 7.6%, the portfolio's third-largest holding. Credit cards are a bedrock in consumers' household finances. Credit card debt across America totals more than $1 trillion today. AXP Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThat will not change anytime soon, and American Express should remain a household brand name. During recent earnings calls, the company's management noted that younger generations, like Millennials and Gen Z, are its fastest-growing demographic. As these consumers mature and become the primary spenders in the economy, American Express should continue delivering for shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 17, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, AbbVie Inc. ABBV, Toyota Motor Corp. TM, Monster Beverage Corp. MNST and General Motors Co. GM.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Apple, AbbVie and Toyota\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time scorecard of the Q4 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., AbbVie Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's reports from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and others, we now have Q4 results from 32 S&P 500 members. Total Q4 earnings for these 32 index members are up +7.2% from the same period last year on +5.8% higher revenues, with 93.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt this relatively early stage in the Q4 reporting cycle, companies appear to be easily beating consensus EPS estimates, but are struggling to come out ahead of revenue estimates.\n\nIn fact, the 93.8% EPS beats percentage matches the highest beats percentage for this group of 32 index members in the last 20 quarters (5 years). On the other hand, the 59.4% revenue beats percentage is the lowest for this group of companies since 2022 Q3.\n\nLooking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +0.3% on +2.2% higher revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nApple shares led the Zacks Tech sector over the past year through roughly mid-December 2023, but have lagged since then. The stock is up +34.8% over the past year vs. +45.2% for the Tech sector and the +20.6% gain for the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nRevenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023’s reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.\r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past six months (+22.8% vs. +16.7%). The company has several new drugs in its portfolio with the potential to drive the top line and make up for lost Humira revenues.\r\n\r\nNewer products, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are performing extremely well, bolstered by approval in new indications. The company has several early/mid-stage candidates that have the potential to drive long-term growth. Though revenues are expected to decline in 2023, AbbVie expects to return to robust sales growth in 2025.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company faces several near-term headwinds like Humira loss of exclusivity, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and economic pressure on Juvederm sales. AbbVie’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past one year. Estimates have risen ahead of Q4 earnings. AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Toyota have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past six months (+22.7% vs. +10.6%). Continued demand for vehicles and a robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles are set to fuel Toyota’s sales volumes. The Japanese auto giant aims to generate 40% of its global sales from electric vehicles by 2025 and 70% by 2030.\r\n\r\nToyota Motors plans to invest 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) for a lineup of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. For fiscal 2024, Toyota projects vehicle sales of 9.6 million units, indicating an increase from 8.82 million units sold in fiscal 2023. Its investor-friendly moves also spark optimism.\r\n\r\nHowever, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on the company’s margins. High capex and R&D expenses on the development of electric and autonomous vehicles are likely to dent its near-term margins and cash flows. The stock warrants a cautious stance at present.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Monster Beverage Corp. and General Motors Co.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "Huawei chases enterprise clients in South Korea as consumers hold onto Samsung, Apple smartphones",
        "content": "This article was first published by The Korea Times in a partnership with the South China Morning Post.\n\nChinese telecommunications equipment giant Huawei Technologies is poised to make a comeback in the global smartphone market this year, but in South Korea, the company must contend with the lingering impact of US sanctions and intense competition with international and local rivals, according to industry watchers.\n\nHuawei is forecast to move into the spotlight in the smartphone industry in 2024, with projected double-digit growth in global shipments, according to a report published last week by research firm TechInsights, which described the Chinese company as a potential \"big surprise\".\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nBut in Korea - home to smartphone and semiconductor titan Samsung Electronics - Huawei is struggling to expand its market share or secure trust from local partners amid the US-China tech rivalry, analysts said.\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company, which has been offering various products and services to Korean customers for two decades, has been effectively absent from the country's smartphone market in the past few years due to its \"inability to source 5G chipsets\", said Abhilash Kumar, an analyst at TechInsights.\n\nA Samsung store in Seoul, South Korea. Photo: Bloomberg alt=A Samsung store in Seoul, South Korea. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\n\"South Korea's smartphone market is 5G-heavy, with a 5G penetration of more than 95 per cent for 2023, so it made little sense for consumers to buy Huawei's 4G-powered phones,\" he said.\n\nSince 2019, Washington has barred the Chinese company, on national security grounds, from accessing US technologies including Google's most popular apps, which are commonly pre-installed in Android phones sold by rivals like Samsung. That has dealt a heavy blow to Huawei's overseas sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuawei, which briefly surpassed Samsung to lead global smartphone shipments in early 2020, has dropped out of the global top five since 2021. Last year, the world's five biggest smartphone vendors were Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, Transsion and Vivo, according to a report published on Monday by research firm IDC.\n\nIn Korea, Huawei had a market share of just 0.1 per cent as of December, far lagging Samsung's 68.7 per cent and Apple's 26.5 per cent, numbers from online database Statcounter showed.\n\nHuawei made a splash in its home market China last August with the surprise launch of the Mate 60 Pro handset equipped with an advanced, domestically-developed 5G chip. The company is reportedly aiming to bring its handsets back to some overseas markets, including in Europe.\n\nStill, \"it looks unlikely\" that the firm would return to the Korean smartphone market, Kumar said.\n\n\"Now that Huawei might have managed to source 5G chipsets locally,\" he said. \"It's still difficult for it because [South Korea] is Samsung- and Apple-heavy and doesn't have much acceptance for Chinese vendors.\"\n\nHuawei has tried to launch both premium and affordable smartphones in Korea since 2014, but it has been unable to gain ground \"largely due to local operators' preference for Samsung,\" said Woody Oh, service director at TechInsights. \"To be successful in the Korean market, [manufacturers] must seek operators' support.\"\n\nCustomers at an Apple store in Hanam, South Korea. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Customers at an Apple store in Hanam, South Korea. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nAmid difficulties in the consumer market, Huawei is pinning its hopes on enterprise services, according to Wang Balian, CEO of Huawei Korea.\n\nThe Huawei-supported 5G network used by Korean carriers ranked first in global tests last year, Wang said at a year-end event in Seoul last month. The company's enterprise products include data centre networks, campus networks and storage services.\n\nWang said the company was also expanding its foothold in the cloud computing market, having established a cloud division in Korea last year in hope of serving the information technology and cultural entertainment industries.\n\nThe executive highlighted Huawei's commitment to the Korean market despite running into controversies last year, when SK Hynix - the second-largest memory chip maker in Korea - announced it was investigating how its products ended up in the Mate 60 Pro.\n\nHynix said at the time that it \"no longer does business with Huawei since the introduction of the US restrictions against the company\".\n\nOne of Huawei's key business partners in Korea is LG Electronics. Wang called LG Uplus, South Korea's third-largest mobile carrier and the country's sole mobile network operator using Huawei's 5G base stations, has been touted as one of the Chinese firm's \"important global clients\".\n\nLooking to 2024, Wang said Huawei Korea, which has more than 230 employees, planned to help the country achieve its digitisation and carbon neutrality goals, while continuing to support the cultivation of 1,000 next-generation information technology professionals.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Futures lower, Chinese annual growth figures - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures point lower on Wednesday, with traders gauging the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year following a hawkish statement from a top official at the central bank. Elsewhere, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) rejects a raft of nominees to its board put forward by activist investors, while headwinds against the Chinese economy loom despite the country posting annual growth that beat Beijing's target.\n\n1. U.S. futures slip\n\nU.S. stock futures were lower on Wednesday, pointing to an extension in losses posted in the prior session, as investors weighed fresh commentary about the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate path this year.\n\nBy 05:10 ET (10:10 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 139 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 21 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dropped by 97 points or 0.6%.\n\nThe main averages in New York dipped on Tuesday, with traders reacting to hawkish language in a closely-watched speech from a top Fed official (see below). A slide in banking stocks following mixed earnings from Wall Street giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley dragged down the benchmark S&P 500 by 0.4%.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also moved lower by 0.2%. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the index's largest components, declined by 1.2% on news that it was offering discounts on its megapopular iPhone device in China in a bid to combat fierce domestic competition.\n\nHighlighting the economic data calendar today will be the release of December U.S. retail sales. Analysts at ING say a strong month-on-month reading could call into question the market's current pricing of a 62% chance of a Fed rate cut in March.\n\n2. Fed's Waller further douses hopes for imminent rate cuts\n\nFed Governor Christopher Waller has said that there was no rush for the world's most influential central bank to begin slashing interest rates down from more than two-decade highs, pouring more cold water on already waning hopes that policymakers could start to lower borrowing costs early this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Waller noted that economic activity and labor markets in the U.S. are in \"good shape,\" while inflation is coming down \"gradually\" to the Fed's stated 2% target.\n\nBecause of these trends, Waller argued, he \"see[s] no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past.\"\n\nThe comments fueled a jump in the rate-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield and the benchmark 10-year yield on Tuesday. At 05:10 ET on Wednesday, the 2-year yield had added 0.044 percentage points to 4.27% and the 10-year yield had inched down slightly by 0.015 percentage points to 4.05%. Yields tend to move inversely to prices.\n\n3. Disney rejects activist board nominees\n\nWalt Disney has rejected nominees to its board of directors put forward by activist investors, saying that the entertainment behemoth's current leadership team has made \"considerable\" progress in executing a sweeping overhaul of the company.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger outlined the group's plan to make its streaming business profitable, turn its sports media brand ESPN into a \"preeminent\" digital platform, improve the output of its film studios, and \"turbocharge\" its key theme parks division.\n\n\"[W]e are continuing to move forward with urgency and clarity,\" Iger said.\n\nActivist stakeholders, disgruntled by weak streaming returns and box office flops that have led to a slide in Disney's stock price, have been attempting to gain board seats in a bid to influence this revamp. One of the fight's most outspoken figures has been Trian Fund Management boss Nelson Peltz, who has heavily criticized Iger as the \"root cause\" of Disney's problems.\n\nTrian had previously nominated both Peltz and ex-Disney finance chief Jay Rasulo to the board, while fellow activist Blackwells Capital had tapped three of its own nominees. In a securities filing rejecting these candidates, Disney hit out at Peltz in particular, claiming he had not \"presented a single strategic idea.\"\n\n4. Chinese growth in 2023 tops official target, but headwinds remain\n\nChina’s economy grew slightly less than expected in the fourth quarter amid consistent pressure from weak spending and a property market decline, although growth for 2023 managed to just edge past government targets.\n\nGross domestic product expanded by 5.2% year-on-year in the three months to Dec. 31, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. The reading was weaker than expectations for growth of 5.3%, but picked up from the 4.9% seen in the prior quarter.\n\nThis brought overall growth for 2023 up to 5.2%, slightly above Beijing’s 5% target. While activity accelerated from the dismal 3% seen in 2022, the stronger number was also driven by a lower base for comparison, given that the country was still grappling with harsh COVID-19 restrictions. Excluding the three years of pandemic-era closures, it was the lowest annual rate of expansion since 1990.\n\nEasing consumer expenditures, a property market meltdown and deflationary pressures all weighed on the Chinese economy throughout last year. New data also showed that the pace the country's population decline quickened in 2023, highlighting the demographic challenges facing the world's second-largest economy.\n\n5. Weak Chinese data hits crude prices\n\nOil prices retreated Wednesday following the disappointing growth data from China, which exacerbated concerns that the country may not be able to help power global crude growth in 2024.\n\nBy 05:12 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 2.2% lower at $70.91 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 2.0% to $76.72 per barrel.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar was exchanging hands around a one-month high after comments from the Fed's Waller lowered expectations that interest rate cuts were imminent. Strength in the greenback can hit demand for dollar-denominated oil from buyers paying with other currencies.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures lower, Chinese annual growth figures - what's moving markets\n\nItalian ports fear blow to business from Red Sea crisis\n\nFactbox-What to expect in 2024: Fed pivot, cooling inflation, easing growth",

How Scientists Are Preparing for the Next Pandemic\n\nThe iPhone accounted for a fifth of the global market with close to 235 million shipments last year, research firm IDC estimates. Samsung, whose shipments slumped double-digits to 226.6 million, came in second, ahead of Chinese device makers like Xiaomi Corp. While Apple has dominated the holiday quarter in recent years, its surge ahead of Samsung over a full year is unprecedented and suggests Apple is weathering an industrywide slump better than rivals.\n\nApple benefited from aggressive offers that have enticed a shift toward premium devices. It managed to expand shipments in 2023 despite a lukewarm reception late in the year for the iPhone 15 in China — its biggest international market — where Huawei Technologies Co.’s growing popularity and a widening ban on government use is depressing sales.\n\nRead More: IPhone Sales in China to Fall Double Digits, Jefferies Says\n\n“While we saw some strong growth from low-end Android players like Transsion and Xiaomi in the second half of 2023, stemming from rapid growth in emerging markets, the biggest winner is clearly Apple,” IDC research director Nabila Popal said. “All this despite facing increased regulatory challenges and renewed competition from Huawei in China, its largest market. Apple’s ongoing success and resilience is in large part due to the increasing trend of premium devices, which now represent over 20% of the market.”\n\nThe shift up the smartphone price chain has been driven in part by attractive trade-in offers and interest-free financing, IDC said. Apple was the only player in the global top three to register growth, of 3.7%, but it has not been immune to the wider decline. Sales in China of the latest-generation iPhone are significantly down from its predecessor, with some analyst expecting those drops to deepen.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of Apple’s challenge in the world’s biggest mobile market comes from local tech powerhouse Huawei, which reclaimed some of the market share it lost after US sanctions by releasing the Mate 60 Pro smartphone running on an advanced made-in-China processor. Apple this week introduced rare discounts on the iPhone in the country, of as much as 5% per handset, as it sought to stem further erosion of sales.\n\n--With assistance from Nick Turner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Japan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla Patti LaBelle Moves From Stage to Stove With a Recipe for Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Apple’s redesigned Apple Watches can bypass an import ban on certain newer models stemming from the tech giant’s patent infringement dispute with Masimo, the medical monitoring technology firm said in a court filing.\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) imposed an import ban on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 last month after the ITC found the watches’ pulse oximeters, which read blood oxygen levels, infringed on Masimo’s patents. Apple appealed the ruling and got a reprieve pending a decision by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which was determining whether the redesigned watches were covered by the ITC’s ban.\n\nAttorneys for Masimo wrote in a court filing that on Friday, Jan. 12, the CBP’s Exclusion Order Enforcement Branch determined that \"Apple’s redesign falls outside the scope of the remedial orders\" in the ITC ban. The filing noted that Apple explained that its redesigned watches \"do not contain pulse oximetry functionality.\"\n\nIt added that Apple has maintained that certain information from the exclusion order enforcement hearing is confidential, so no copy of the CBP decision was included in the filing or has been made publicly available.\n\nAPPLE BOARD MEMBERS AL GORE, JAMES BELL TO RETIRE Apple has redesigned Apple Watches at the center of a patent infringement dispute with Masimo to get around an import ban, Masimo said in a court filing.\n\n\"Apple’s arguments lead to the conclusion that the EOE Branch decision finding the redesign outside the scope of the remedial orders would eliminate any irreparable harm alleged by Masimo,\" the filing stated.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nA Masimo spokesperson told FOX Business in a statement, \"Apple's claim that its redesigned watch does not contain pulse oximetry is a positive step toward accountability. It is especially important that one of the world's largest and most powerful companies respects the intellectual property rights of smaller companies and complies with ITC orders when it is caught infringing.\"\n\nAPPLE WINS APPEAL TO TEMPORARILY PAUSE APPLE WATCH BAN Apple Watches affected by the import ban are the Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches that contain pulse oximeters to read blood oxygen levels.\n\nApple has included a pulse oximeter feature in its smartwatches since its Apple Watch Series 6 was released in 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nMasimo sued Apple that winter, alleging the tech giant stole trade secrets related to technology for reading blood oxygen levels and infringed on its patents. Apple then countersued Masimo for patent infringement, alleging that its actions were a legal \"maneuver to clear a path\" for a competing smartwatch. Masimo released its W1 watch which tracks blood oxygen levels and other health indicators in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, Masimo asked the ITC to block imports and sales of Apple Watches that allegedly infringed its patents. That led to the ITC’s ruling in favor of Masimo last year and the ban taking effect in December. Apple briefly paused sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches in the days before Christmas before the decision, though it resumed sales after the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals said it would put the ban on hold while it considers Apple’s appeal. Apple briefly paused sales of Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 last month due to the import ban. The reportedly redesigned watches do not contain pulse oximetry technology at the center of the dispute.\n\nApple’s appeal is pending before the Federal Circuit, which may continue the pause or reinstate the ban on Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches with pulse oximetry technology that haven’t been redesigned. Apple said that the Series 9 and Ultra 2 remain available for sale with the blood oxygen feature.\n\nThe company said Monday that the Federal Circuit will rule on its motion to continue the pause on the ban for the duration of the appeal sometime on or after Jan. 16 and that it expects the appeal to take at least a year.\n\nVersions of the Apple Watch that don’t contain the blood oxygen sensor are unaffected by the patent dispute and can continue to be sold without being redesigned.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple Watch drops blood oxygen features to dodge import ban",

        "content": "Apple is prepared to remove the blood-oxygen sensor from its internet-connected watches if a court doesn’t give it more leeway while it pursues a bid to overturn a ruling that has blocked its use of the technology.\n\nA potential redesign of two Apple Watch models, the Series 9 and Ultra 2, that would exclude the blood-oxygen sensor has been approved by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to a Monday court filing by Masimo, a Southern California company pursuing a patent claim against Apple.\n\nThe document didn't disclose how Apple plans to remove the blood-oxygen sensor, although analysts have speculated the change could come through a software update.\n\nMasimo won a favorable ruling from the U.S. International Trade Commission in late October that prompted Apple to temporarily halt sales of the Apple Watch models with the blood-oxygen sensor just before Christmas. But Apple then filed an appeal of the ITC ruling that resulted in a order clearing the way for the two Apple Watch models to return to stores shortly after Christmas while the appeal is under review.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington is expected to decide whether it extend the stay later this month. If it does, the Series 9 and Ultra 2 can remain on sale with the blood-oxygen sensors intact.\n\nIt will probably take at least a year for the appeals process to unfold, meaning Apple will need an extended stay to continue selling the watches with the blood-oxygen sensors as part of the company's effort to position the products as health-monitoring devices.\n\nApple declined to comment on the court filing disclosing its plans to remove the blood-oxygen sensor if the stay isn't extended.\n\nIn their arguments filed so far with the appeals court, Masimo and Apple have been painting dramatically different pictures of the technology involved in the dispute.\n\nMasimo has depicted itself as a pioneer in the making of blood-oxygen sensors on wearable devices, prompting Apple to begin luring away some of its employees as far back as 2013 — a year before the first version of the Apple Watch was unveiled.\n\nWhen Apple finally introduced a watch with a blood-oxygen sensor in September 2020 during the throes of the pandemic, Masimo alleged the technology was so unreliable that it threated to taint its reputation and hurt sales of its W1 medical watch. Masimo says its pulse oximeters are used by hospitals and other professionals that treat 200 million patients annually.\n\nApple has denied infringing on a Masimo technology that has limited availability to consumers. Masimo's W1 watch wasn't even available on the market when the dispute started in 2021 and the device still has negligible sales, according to Apple. In contrast, Apple accounts for roughly one-third of smartwatch shipments — a business that generates an estimated $18 billion in annual sales for the Cupertino, California, company. That represents about 5% of Apple's annual revenue.",

        "content": "Apple is (AAPL) reportedly cutting the price of its iPhone in China. Creative Strategies Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin notes that the price cuts coms as China enters into Chinese New Year which he says is a normal time for promotions.\n\nBajarin says that, overall, that the smartphone markets is \"in a period of recovery.\" Though replacement cycles now run longer across smartphones, he views iPhone demand trends in China rebounding off lows.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- A busy few days for Apple shares down on news that the company is offering discounts on its newer iPhones in China amid slow demand, as well as news that Apple Watches may be losing the blood oxygen feature to avoid a US import ban. Joining us now to break this all down is Ben Bajarin, creative strategies, CEO, and principal analyst.\n\nBen, it is always great to have you on the program. It's a few places I could start, Ben. A few different headlines.\n\nBut maybe I'll begin Ben with these reports we're seeing that Apple is offering these discounts in China, Ben, including on its latest and greatest iPhones. You know Apple backwards and forwards, Ben. How rare is it for Apple to do that in China?\n\nAnd why do you think Tim Cook is doing that? Is that signaling weakening demand over there, increasing local competition? What do you think?\n\nBEN BAJARIN: Yeah, I think there's a mix of things. This is obviously always been a strong quarter. Thanks to Chinese New Year for iPhone in China.\n\nI know there's been some-- because of those promotions and because of Chinese New Year, there's been some not necessarily discounts, but promotions that have been happening as well. We're not seeing a tremendous amount of demand softness, if you will.\n\nBut I do think there's variations between all of those models. For example, China is continuing to be strong in the upper end of that price band. So higher ASP, more Pro Max has definitely been part of that mix shift.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo I think part of that sort of rebalancing of the portfolio could be part of it. And where carriers are looking to do some of those promotions.\n\nBut I think, again, just on the back of what we typically see in Chinese New Year, this has typically been a relatively strong quarter. But that mix shift is going to be one of the bigger questions is how much volume versus how much is the ASP rise in that region.\n\n- Ben, does this tell you that Tim Cook is worried about sales in China?\n\nBEN BAJARIN: I don't think so. I've seen pockets of this before. I think, again, we're in a period of recovery for the smartphone market in general. China had some signals of that last year.\n\nSo I think there was some optimism going into this quarter. But, again, one of the biggest dynamics that I think is impacting the industry as a whole is that it's been evident now for six to eight months that the smartphone replacement cycle is lengthening in every region, which includes China.\n\nChina typically has had the shortest refreshment cycle of anyone. And that's now expanding to anywhere between 3 and six months based on price span. That in itself is having different implications on the market as a whole.\n\nAnd so I think there's some rebalancing again of that strategy of how carriers are going to start to move some of those promotions trying to keep some of those sales afloat.\n\n- And, Ben, there's a lot of investor interest in Huawei as well. I'm just interested to get your take. How much of a real competitive threat do you think Huawei actually poses to Apple in China?\n\nBEN BAJARIN: It still remains to be unseen. That's a big part of the debate. Obviously, they were amongst one of the biggest competitors, especially in premium for Apple prior to some of the sanctions that got hit on them from the US.\n\nIt feels like that's starting to grow again in momentum. But, again, it's still relatively small. They're also trying to do this with some of their own silicon, which is raising a little bit of questions in terms of the product quality there.\n\nI think the next few quarters will probably be much more telling as to the strength of Huawei. But there is a lot of increasing competition there. Obviously, Xiaomi continues to be strong.\n\nAnd you see a range of products from the BBK group like Oppo and Vivo continuing to be strong there. So, yes, increased competition, lengthening smartphone cycles, all those things adding to dynamic. That's really hitting everybody in the region.",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) ended the recent trading session at $183.63, demonstrating a -1.23% swing from the preceding day's closing price. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.37%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.62%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.19%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's stock has dropped by 5.09% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.56%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on February 1, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.08, signifying a 10.64% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $117.49 billion, up 0.29% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.57 per share and a revenue of $393.49 billion, demonstrating changes of +7.18% and +2.66%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple.

It is now down about 1% from that record high.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street rose last week as investors continued to bet on an early start to the Fed's monetary-policy-easing cycle, despite a lack of supporting voices among policymakers and mixed inflation data.\n\nUBS Global Research boosted its 2024 year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,150 points, representing a more than 8% upside from current levels.\n\nOf the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, 10 declined, led by a 2.4% drop in energy, followed by a 1.2% loss in materials. The technology index rose 0.4%.\n\nThe S&P 500 declined 0.37% to end the session at 4,765.98 points.\n\nThe Nasdaq declined 0.19% to 14,944.35 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.62% to 37,361.12 points.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was relatively heavy, with 13.0 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 12.1 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices jumped 8.3% after Barclays analysts raised their price targets for AMD and several other chipmakers, saying they would benefit from growth in artificial intelligence. Larger rival Nvidia climbed about 3% and hit a record high.\n\nBoeing slumped almost 8% to a two-month low after the Federal Aviation Administration extended the grounding of its 737 MAX 9 airplanes indefinitely and Wells Fargo downgraded the stock to \"equal weight\" from \"overweight.\"\n\nDeclining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 by a 2.6-to-one ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 23 new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 63 new highs and 182 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California, and Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "title": "7 Dow Stocks Poised to Shine in a Strong 2024 U.S. Economy",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is widely expected to continue to perform well in 2024. The index represents 30 of the most prominent U.S. firms that are considered to be the most important Equities within the New York Stock Exchange and the nasdaq.\n\nThe Dow is widely considered to be a representative barometer of the U.S. economy and stock market overall. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to cut rates multiple times which will serve to propel the index higher. So, it’s reasonable to broadly invest in the Dow Jones Industrial index and expect returns. That said, there are better Dow stocks amongst the 30 in which to invest.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith approximately a week left until American Express (NYSE:AXP) releases 4th quarter earnings investors should consider purchasing the stock. The company has done very well over the last year as Americans rack up record credit card debt.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat debt also comes with high interest rates due to high Fed funds rates intended to tamp down inflation. American Express provided strong fundamentals when it released its third quarter results months ago. However, investors should also anticipate that the fourth quarter will be strong.\n\nHoliday spending ended up being strong after expectations wavered. That implies that credit card spending will have been strong as well which bolsters the investment case for American Express.\n\nThe net result is that American Express will have created a new set of assets in the form of accounts payable during the last year or so. Again, consumers are leveraging credit at record rates and the interest charges are currently very high. Those consumers will be repaying American Express for some time to come which will result in stronger top and bottom line results overall for some time to come.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nIt’s easy to see why investors might be tempted to avoid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock early in 2024. The year hasn’t started out very well at all. iPhone sales in China continue to slump. Meanwhile, in the U.S., sales of its Apple watch continue to be blocked. Those blows have prompted prominent analyst houses to downgrade the stock in recent weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat raises an important question for investors: will Apple stand by idly as Microsoft passes it as the most valuable firm globally? The answer of course is no.\n\nBut it won’t be easy. The Chinese government will continue to prefer Huawei phones for its officials over Apple products. That isn’t going to change. That’s part and parcel of a broader conversation around Apple, China, and the US. Apple is going to continue to reassure part of its supply chain and customer base to appealing markets, particularly India.\n\nThere’s potential for Apple to derive wins from that situation. Whether that occurs or not it remains to be seen, of course. At the same time, the company is going to release its Vision Pro headset on Feb. 2 Which is one more reason to find optimism around Apple overall.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf 2024 is like 2023 then Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) will be among the best Dow stocks for investors to hold. In fact, Salesforce shares roughly doubled in 2023. Then, to start 2024, its shares emerged as the strongest performer through the first 10 days of 2024.\n\nOne factor to consider in that regard is the high institutional ownership of Salesforce equity. Institutional ownership accounts for 81% of all holdings of CRM shares. Institutional owners have a lot of collective power and as a result can shift share prices very quickly. If they see something they don’t like and offload their holdings — which tend to be substantial — share prices drop rapidly.\n\nThere are important macroeconomic cyclical reasons to believe that will not be the case. Primarily, the notion that multiple rate cuts are on the horizon. It is currently expected that the Federal Reserve will cut rates three times in 2024, likely beginning in March. That will result in cheaper borrowing which should prompt institutions to invest heavily in customer relationship management overall. That should be a boon to Salesforce which dominates the space.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was a massive winner in 2023 due to the emergence of AI, in particular generative AI. The company’s investment in OpenAI and ChatGPT served to propel its stock price substantially higher throughout the year.\n\nThat said, Microsoft’s connection to the artificial intelligence boom didn’t result in greater revenues. In truth, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the clearest case of a company that actually saw top-line results due to the AI boom; it managed to sell many many more chips leading to greater revenues\n\nMicrosoft, on the other hand, has largely benefited due to the hype surrounding AI to this point. The reason that Microsoft is expected to be strong in 2024 relates to its pursuit of AI-related revenues.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Microsoft’s AI Investments to begin to lift revenues in a substantial manner in 2024. The company has invested heavily in adding AI functionality to its Office suite, referred to as CoPilot. further, Wall Street expects the company’s Cloud Revenue to be boosted substantially by AI in 2024. That potential makes Microsoft one of the best choices on the Dow for 2024.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) Will continue to represent a compelling mix of income and growth potential in 2024. That makes its stock a strong choice throughout 2024.\n\nOn the income side, investors should consider that IBM pays a dividend yielding approximately 4.1% at present. It’s a very safe form of income having last been reduced in 1994. In short, IBM shares are going to continue to appeal to income investors.\n\nThat said, IBM isn’t without compelling growth narratives. Specifically, cloud and quantum computing. Both of those sectors continue to Garner a lot of attention from investors seeking growth opportunities. Cloud computing is expected to continue to strengthen especially due to the introduction of artificial intelligence. At the same time, IBM is a leading firm in the realm of quantum computing. Quantum computing promises to speed the development of artificial intelligence Beyond the capabilities of classic computers.\n\nConsequently, IBM is going to continue to garner a lot of attention for its potent mix of income and growth potential throughout 2024.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Isn’t a particularly flashy company. The company deals primarily in Internet protocol (IP) networking. Again, not flashy and so it’s arguable that Cisco Systems might not ‘shine’ in 2024 because it is somewhat ho-hum.\n\nYet Cisco Systems continues to grow. particularly in relation to revenues. Over the last 12 months revenue has grown at a rate of 12.6%. That rate exceeds the 6.2% revenue growth experienced over the last three years which itself exceeds the revenue growth over the past five years of 5.2%. That alone is a compelling case for the hypothesis that Cisco Systems is heating up.\n\nBroadly speaking, Cloud firms and other enterprises are going to continue to invest in strengthening their respective communications ability. The artificial intelligence opportunity makes that a near certainty.\n\nThat suggests that Cisco Systems growth rate has continued room for growth. Falling interest rates will serve to drive greater investment as lending costs fall which is yet another reason to consider Cisco systems. None of this even considers Cisco Systems’ dividend which currently yields more than 3%.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nArguments that favor investment in Visa (NYSE:V) and its stock are largely the same as those that apply to American Express, above.\n\nVisa has benefited from many of the same factors that have propelled American Express and other credit card firms higher. I won’t waste my time reiterating those factors. Everyone is well aware that credit card spending is at historical levels.\n\nThat truth is reflected in the strong growth rates for Visa during the last 5 years. Somewhat surprisingly, Visa’s revenue growth rate over the last 3 years is actually higher than it was over the last 12 months: 16.8% versus 14.1%.\n\nPerhaps the explanation lies in pandemic stimulus to some degree. Whatever the case, Visa continues to be strong overall with top-line growth well into the double digit rates no matter how you slice it. There continues to be a strong case for investing in credit card companies which have all the potential to outperform average Dow stocks in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 worst states for dividend income investors. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Worst States for Dividend Income Investors.\n\nWhy Should Investors Consider Dividend Aristocrats?\n\nOn December 30, 2023, Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer at Roundhill Investments, appeared in aninterview on Yahoo Finance, where he discussed the possible investment opportunities in 2024. Mazza said 2023 has been significant for the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks which include Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others. While artificial intelligence has led the year as a primary catalyst, Mazza reckons 2024 to be divided for the big tech group. He highlighted that the bifurcation of the market may simply depend on rate cuts, when and if they are fully enforced.\n\nMazza said that the market has been performing well and has been out of the earning recessions rut, which again is a good sign for the money market.  Moreover, he added that slowing inflation rates and increasing earnings on the horizon is a testament to the expansion of earnings in the stock market. However, while 2024 holds a positive outlook, the primary concern for investors will be consumers. Rising credit card spending and consumer stress are common factors, which may be significant later in the year, or act as a game changer for the market.\n\nMazza thinks dividend aristocrats, or companies that have been consistent with their dividend growth for 20 to 25 years, will be the best place to for investors to position themselves. He further added that dividend kings and dividend monarchs will be significant to investors, especially early in 2024. He said that these companies tend to be extremely resilient against market forces and happen to report consistent and strong free cash flow. Mazza noted that the upcoming elections and the pressure on the Fed shape his less favorable view of the market for the second half of 2024. Therefore, until consumer behavior is unclear, it might be safer to stick to elite dividend payers.\n\nStory continues\n\nElite Dividend Payers in the Market\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the most notable companies known for their continuous dividend growth rates.

The initiative suggests that no sparkling 500-mL water bottle will be made from virgin plastic starting in 2024. The initiative is a huge step forward for the company's sustainability plans. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has implemented a cyclical system in place, which spreads across the recycling, cleaning, and sorting of plastic until it is transformed into flakes to produce new bottles. To support the initiative, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also launched an advertising campaign called \"Recycle Me Again.\"\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is another top stock pick among dividend investors, as of January 16 the stock is offering a forward dividend yield of 2.50%. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was a part of 75 hedge fund portfolios at the close of the third quarter of 2023. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $5.73 billion, up from $5.35 billion in the previous quarter with 74 positions. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive. As of December 31, 2023, Ayrshire Capital Management is the largest shareholder in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and has a position worth $4.22 million. The stock covers 2.43% of the fund's portfolio.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is not only a dividend aristocrat, but it is also a dividend king. As of January 16, the stock has a forward dividend yield of 2.93%. The company's commitment to expand is a testament to its popularity in the industry. On January 8, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)signed an agreement to acquire Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAM) for a staggering $2.0 billion. The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company is focused on designing next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Such will enhance the efficacy across multiple cancer indications such as the ARX517, ARX788, and ARX305. The acquisition will allow Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to leverage Ambrx's (NASDAQ:AMAM) ADC technology to eliminate cancer cells using monoclonal antibodies linked to a potent chemotherapeutic payload.\n\nWall Street is positive on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). On January 9, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen reiterated an Overweight rating on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and maintained her price target of $215.

(TM).

Total Q4 earnings for these 32 index members are up +7.2% from the same period last year on +5.8% higher revenues, with 93.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt this relatively early stage in the Q4 reporting cycle, companies appear to be easily beating consensus EPS estimates, but are struggling to come out ahead of revenue estimates.\n\nIn fact, the 93.8% EPS beats percentage matches the highest beats percentage for this group of 32 index members in the last 20 quarters (5 years). On the other hand, the 59.4% revenue beats percentage is the lowest for this group of companies since 2022 Q3.\n\nLooking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +0.3% on +2.2% higher revenues.\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nApple shares led the Zacks Tech sector over the past year through roughly mid-December 2023, but have lagged since then. The stock is up +34.8% over the past year vs. +45.2% for the Tech sector and the +20.6% gain for the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nRevenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023’s reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.\r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past six months (+22.8% vs. +16.7%). The company has several new drugs in its portfolio with the potential to drive the top line and make up for lost Humira revenues.\r\n\r\nNewer products, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are performing extremely well, bolstered by approval in new indications. The company has several early/mid-stage candidates that have the potential to drive long-term growth. Though revenues are expected to decline in 2023, AbbVie expects to return to robust sales growth in 2025.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company faces several near-term headwinds like Humira loss of exclusivity, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and economic pressure on Juvederm sales.  AbbVie’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past one year. Estimates have risen ahead of Q4 earnings. AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Toyota have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past six months (+22.7% vs. +10.6%). Continued demand for vehicles and a robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles are set to fuel Toyota’s sales volumes. The Japanese auto giant aims to generate 40% of its global sales from electric vehicles by 2025 and 70% by 2030.\r\n\r\nToyota Motors plans to invest 4 trillion yen ($35 billion) for a lineup of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. For fiscal 2024, Toyota projects vehicle sales of 9.6 million units, indicating an increase from 8.82 million units sold in fiscal 2023. Its investor-friendly moves also spark optimism.\r\n\r\nHowever, commodity cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on the company’s margins. High capex and R&D expenses on the development of electric and autonomous vehicles are likely to dent its near-term margins and cash flows. The stock warrants a cautious stance at present.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Toyota here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include EOG Resources, Inc.

        "title": "US Supreme Court declines to wade into Apple's dispute with Epic Games",
        "content": "The US Supreme Court declined to take up dueling appeals from Apple (AAPL) and “Fortnite” developer Epic Games.\n\nIn an order issued Tuesday, the court announced it would not grant either of the two appeals that asked the justices to reconsider a ruling that impacts Apple’s control over its lucrative App Store. As a result, an appellate court ruling mostly favoring Apple, though requiring it to make some changes, will stand.\n\nIn the appeals case, the Ninth Circuit upheld a California trial court's ruling, holding that while the trial court erred in its analysis, Epic nonetheless failed to show that Apple held an illegal monopoly in a relevant market.\n\nConsequently, the court said, the tech giant did not violate federal antitrust law — a result that spared Apple from having to break up or divest its closely guarded App Store.\n\nThe decision isn't all upside for Apple, however. The Ninth Circuit's ruling revives an injunction that requires the smart phone behemoth to allow developers to include links and buttons in their apps that direct users to pay for app purchases outside the App Store.\n\nThe injunction puts billions in revenue in jeopardy for Apple. The company, which holds roughly 15% of the global smartphone market, earns fees on in-app purchases created by more than 30 million iOS app developers. The Ninth Circuit said at the time of Epic's trial against Apple that the number of video games on Apple's operating mobile system had grown from 131 in the early days of the iPhone to over 300,000. These gaming apps, the court said, generated an estimated $100 billion in annual revenue.\n\nThe appeals court said Epic failed in its case by not adequately showing that Apple's App Store qualified as a relevant app market. The court went on to say that Epic also failed to introduce some substantially less restrictive means by which Apple could maintain its iOS ecosystem.\n\nIn a minor win for Epic, the Ninth Circuit also let stand US District Court Judge Gonzalez Rogers’s determination that Apple had violated California’s Unfair Competition law. To remedy the violation, the court ordered Apple to allow Epic and other app developers offer alternative in-app payment methods.\n\nStory continues\n\nEpic had hoped the Supreme Court would take up its broader claim that developers should be able to get their apps onto iPhones through third-party app stores in addition to Apple's App Store.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court's decision not to hear Epic's appeal helps Apple by ensuring it keeps its App Store intact, the court's decision not to hear Apple's appeal could seriously bruise the tech giant. Apple benefits handsomely from the 15% and 30% fees it charges app developers on the sale of products through its App Store when using Apple's payment service.\n\nIf app developers can offer their own payment options in apps, they can bypass Apple's fees, cutting into the company's App Store revenue. Developers could sweeten the deal for consumers by selling apps and in-app products at a discount, since they won't have to make up for Apple's fees any longer.\n\nApple doesn't break out its App Store revenue numbers, but rather includes them as part of the company's overall services business. That segment, which also includes subscriptions for products like Apple TV+ and Apple Care, generated $85.2 billion of Apple's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. Failed to make his case: Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. (Getty)\n\nThe Epic-Apple dispute began more than two years ago when “Fortnite,” with about 350 million registered players, was booted from Apple’s and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) app stores and banned from their operating systems.\n\nThe bans were a response to Epic’s gaming program, which circumvented the platforms by offering direct in-game purchases at a 20% discount. Apple and Google both said the move violated their terms of service, justifying removal from the stores.\n\nEpic then filed separate lawsuits against Google and Apple with nearly identical allegations that the removals violated federal and California antitrust laws.\n\nWhile the two cases center on what level of control tech giants should have over the third-party developers, a jury came to an opposite conclusion in the case that went forward against Google.\n\nIn a jury trial, jurors sided with Epic, finding that Google had abused the dominance of its Android operating system app distribution and in-app billing markets by extracting exorbitant fees from Epic and other third-party app makers. A separate portion of the trial to determine a remedy for the violation is scheduled to take place later in January. A final outcome, however, is likely years away, as Google is expected to appeal the case.\n\nWhile Apple prohibits users from installing apps on their iPhones from outside the App Store, Google's Android lets users install apps from third-party app stores, albeit after forcing them to make changes in their device's settings menu and read a warning about doing so.\n\nApple's App Store is facing pressure from governments around the globe. Regulators from South Korea and Japan to the UK and EU have or are looking into ways to make the iPhone maker open up its devices to allow third-party app stores on its devices or provide alternative payment options in apps.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision to not take up the Epic and Apple appeals could also impact the US Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into Apple’s App Store and other business lines.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Most had reported lower profits on Friday.\n\nThe broader banks index slid to an over one-month low on Tuesday.\n\nAmong others, Apple dropped 1.6%, after offering rare discounts on its iPhones in China owing to competition pressures, days after being overtaken by Microsoft as the world's most valuable firm.\n\nAlso dampening sentiment were remarks by Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who said that while he was more confident of inflation being on track to the 2% target, there should be no rush to cut rates.\n\nTraders\n\npared their expectations\n\nfor the Federal Reserve starting rate cuts in March after the comments, with U.S. Treasury yields also rising.\n\n\"Central banks across the world are starting to push back against bets of more aggressive interest rate cuts,\" said Nick Zamparelli, chief investment officer at Sequoia Financial Group.\n\nWall Street finished the previous week higher as investors continued to pin their hopes on an early start to the Fed's monetary-policy-easing cycle - despite a lack of supporting voices among policymakers and mixed inflation data.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What you're hearing from a lot of these policymakers is... it's a little bit too early to declare victory against inflation and that is clearly a headwind to risky assets that are pricing in a much more accommodative monetary policy stance,\" Zamparelli said.\n\nUBS Global Research boosted its 2024 year-end target for the S&P 500 on Tuesday to 5,150 points, representing an over 8% upside from current levels.\n\nEven after briefly surpassing its previous record closing high last week, the benchmark index has faced resistance to breaching its highest intra-day level, hit in January 2022.\n\nAt 11:58 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 210.48 points, or 0.56%, at 37,382.50, the S&P 500 was down 16.27 points, or 0.34%, at 4,767.56, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 36.87 points, or 0.25%, at 14,935.89.\n\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices jumped 3.1% and 7.9%, respectively, as investor optimism over the prospects of higher demand for artificial intelligence-powered chips prompted Wall Street analysts to hike their price targets for the semiconductor giants.\n\nDow Jones dropped to a one-week low, after Boeing slumped 7.7% to a two-month low, as the Federal Aviation Administration extended the grounding of its 737 MAX 9 airplanes indefinitely and brokerage Wells Fargo downgraded the stock to \"equal weight\" from \"overweight\".\n\nApplied Digital\n\nslumped 23.0% after the data-center services provider posted downbeat second-quarter revenue.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.27-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.53-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 128 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court refused to consider Apple Inc.’s appeal in an antitrust suit challenging its lucrative App Store, a decision that will likely affect billions of dollars in revenue for the iPhone maker.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBonds Slide as Fed’s Waller Downplays Need to Rush: Markets Wrap Iowa Latest: Haley Unveils New Ad, Looking to New Hampshire Trump Scores Easy Win in Iowa With DeSantis a Distant Second What Is Disease X? How Scientists Are Preparing for the Next Pandemic Musk Pressures Tesla’s Board for Another Massive Stock Award\n\nThe decision lets stand a 2023 appeals court ruling that found Apple’s business model didn’t violate antitrust laws, but that it did violate California’s Unfair Competition Law by limiting the developers ability to communicate about alternate payment systems that may cost less. The decision applies nationally and the iPhone maker must start letting developers tell users about cheaper payment options.\n\nBoth Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. had asked the court to hear an appeal related to the case. The justices turned down both appeals without explanation.\n\nApple shares slid as much as 2.7% after the court’s announcement before paring their decline. The stock was down 1.8% to $180.93 at 12:06 p.m. in New York.\n\nThe high court’s decision ends a temporary stay in the case and lets developers start directing iPhone users to cheaper purchasing options outside of Apple App Store via buttons or links to outside websites. Apple charges developers a commission of as much as 30% for digital goods and services sold through its App Store. The change will allow developers to bypass Apple’s system and offer links to cheaper alternatives.\n\n“As of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said in a thread on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nApple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillions of dollars are at stake. In app spending is forecast to reach $182 billion this year and $207 billion in 2025, according to research firm Sensor Tower. And competitors are ready to steal a piece of it: Microsoft Corp. has said that it’s already in talks to launch a mobile app store focused on gaming.\n\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals last year largely affirmed a lower-court judge’s 2021 decision largely rejecting claims by Epic that Apple’s online marketplace policies violated federal antitrust law because they ban third-party app marketplaces on its operating system. But the appeals court also upheld a federal judge’s ruling that the iPhone maker’s practices don’t violate federal antitrust law, rejecting the bulk of Epic’s case against Apple’s App Store.\n\nThat decision had been on hold while the Supreme Court appeals were pending.\n\nThe Epic case was the first to challenge Apple’s lucrative App Store system, which rakes in billions of dollars each year. In the interim, the company has come under serious pressure around the world, including in Europe where competition enforcers have two antitrust cases pending against the tech giant. EU authorities are expected to fine the company later this year for allegedly using its App Store rules to thwart music-streaming rivals like Spotify Technologies SA.\n\nIn a separate Epic suit in December, a jury found that Alphabet Inc.’s Google unfairly wields monopoly power in its Android app store. Google has said it plans to appeal, but key legislation in Europe, investigations in the US and UK and an expected wave of follow-on lawsuits will keep pressure on the tech giants’ app store duopoly.\n\nThe cases are Apple v. Epic, 23-244, and Epic v. Apple, 23-337.\n\n(Updates with Epic comment in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Patti LaBelle Moves From Stage to Stove With a Recipe for Success How AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top Priority Trumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "One of the most renowned investors of our generation, Renowned investor Warren Buffett, who has a net worth of over $110 billion, practices simple investing policies, claiming that the greatest investment moves are typically met with yawns.\n\n\"If they told everybody what a simple game [investing] was, 90% of the income of the people that were speaking would disappear,\" Buffett said during an annual shareholders meeting.\n\nThough Buffett owns several businesses that allowed him to amass such wealth, his investment portfolio has generated millions in annual dividend income alone. He advised beginners to consistently invest in low-cost index funds despite the market fluctuations.\n\n\"Consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund,\" Buffett said in 2017. \"Keep buying it through thick and thin and especially through thin.\"\n\nWhile the stock market has recovered from the initial weakness observed in the first trading week of January, lingering recession fears coupled with worsening geopolitical tensions could cause equities to fluctuate again in the near term. However, consistently purchasing shares of top S&P 500 stocks could allow investors to build up a sizable portfolio.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nSome of the industry-leading S&P 500 stocks to consider are :\n\nApple Inc.\n\nTech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has delivered a lackluster performance so far in 2024, with the stock falling by over 3.4% year to date. Weakening global demand for iPhones and other Apple products resulted in the company being downgraded by analysts earlier this month, causing Apple to lose its position as the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarclays analyst Tim Long downgraded Apple to Underweight with a price target of $160, saying, \"We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables.\"\n\nBuffett claims Apple to be one of the best companies to invest in, calling it a \"better business than anything we own.\" As the company works toward strengthening its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, buying the dip in this S&P 500 company could be fruitful for investors.\n\nJPMorgan\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), the largest banking institution in the U.S. in terms of total assets under management, is one of the best banking stocks to bet on.\n\nThough the banking giant's revenue dwindled in fiscal 2023 as the high interest rates discouraged borrowing, its profit margins soared. JPMorgan's net profits amounted to a record $49.6 billion in fiscal 2023, reflecting a 32% year-over-year increase.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve poised to slash interest rates by at least 25 basis points in March, JPMorgan's revenue is expected to improve as borrowing activity picks up nationwide. The company's acquisition of First Republic Bank is also expected to pay off in the coming quarters.\n\nJPMorgan also maintains significant reserves in case of a recession or market downturn. It has a loss-absorbing capacity of $514 billion and a cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $1.4 trillion as of Dec. 31.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp.\n\nExxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) is one of the largest oil and gas producers in the U.S. While the stock has dipped by over 2.6% over the past five days as global recession fears have tanked oil prices worldwide, the company's immense production capabilities make it one of the best oil and gas stocks to invest in.\n\nExxon acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Co. last year for $60 billion, which doubled the former's production volume in the Permian Basin to 1.3 barrels of oil equivalent.\n\nLast month, the company unveiled a corporate plan to bolster its earnings and cash flow growth potential over the next four years. Apart from reducing its carbon emissions significantly, Exxon's earnings are expected to rise at a compounded annual growth rate of 18% through 2027.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "title": "Tesla, Apple, Synopsis: Trending tickers",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is a top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance after CEO Elon Musk posted on his social media platform X that he is \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) is reportedly removing the blood-oxygen sensor from some of its watches in order to avoid a ban on the devices. It's part of an ongoing patent dispute between the tech giant and medical technology company Masimo (MASI).\n\nChip software company Synopsys (SNPS) is buying Ansys (ANSS), an engineering software firm, in a $35 billion deal. The cash and stock deal is set to close in the first half of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.\n\nYahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo and Akiko Fujita break down some of Tuesday's top trending tickers.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, now let's take a look at some trending tickers. Tesla shares in focus this morning. CEO Elon Musk saying he wants more voting power at the EV giant. Writing in a post on X He says he's, quote, \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robots without having around 25% of voting control.\"\n\nSo Akiko, he does mention in this tweet in this X that he wants enough to be influential, but not so much that he can't be overturned. But it does seem to be the case that he's hinting at potentially, building some of these products outside of Tesla. Looking at some big Tesla Bulls, here we saw commentary from Dan Ives saying, the board and Musk will be able to resolve this.\n\nHe's estimating in the next three to six months-- really thinks that the shareholders will be fine. And Musk did praise the Tesla board in a following tweet as well and said that he couldn't do it through a compensation package because he still has an outstanding trial in Delaware that's still being resolved. But a bit of a power move here considering some of the issues that Tesla has already been facing with its stock price.\n\nStory continues\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, a few things to note here. He's looking for 25% control. He has roughly 13% control right now. Also, the fact that he's talking about Tesla becoming a leader in the AI and robotics space seems to be an admission that it's not exactly where it needs to be despite past Musk comments. But this is certainly going to be a really tricky decision for the board if it does come to that because this comes at a really, really delicate time for Tesla when you think about the concerns that shareholders have expressed about Elon Musk splitting time between the company's Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter, or X, I should mention.\n\nAlso, at a time when we have seen EV sales soften, there's been a massive move to price cuts because Tesla certainly isn't the only player as well. It's not just a US story. It's also in the biggest EV market over in China. So it's going to be a tricky balance for the board to make that decision if it does come to that because there are concerns about where Tesla is moving, which direction it's moving at a time of increased competition at its core business, which is really still autos.\n\nWell, another tech giant in the news this morning, Apple. Reports suggest the company will remove the blood oxygen sensor from its smartwatches to get around a patent dispute with medical technology company Masimo. They cite a court filing from the health tech company, a story, Rachelle, that we've been following very closely since that deadline passed back in December for Apple to have to take those specific watches off the market as a result of this patent dispute.\n\nI will point out, by the way, though, we're talking about their wearables. There's another headline that crossed today that to me is kind of interesting on Apple-- Apple topping Samsung in global smartphone shipments for the first time in 2023. If you look at the revenue breakdown for Apple, it still is about those iPhones, certainly a big win for Apple. Yes, backwards looking but we're still talking about those handsets that are key to the revenue for Apple.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. I mean, you raised a good point because as much headlines as we're seeing about the watch, the iPhone really is their hero product here. So still making that progress there, and I think Apple really considering, is it really worth us to keep going down this road with Massimo? They've tried to make some of the changes. The courts are looking at that and saying, perhaps this might not be enough as they're looking at some of the changes they're trying to make saying, it's not just a software issue.\n\nIt's a hardware issue as well. We'll have to wonder if, perhaps, they partner with another company on this because health still at the forefront of Apple's ecosystem here and some of the developments that they want to make not just with their phones and tracking as well. But they want to push more in this health space. So perhaps they'll find a different avenue to go down. But it appears that this route-- the blood oxygen sensor involving Masimo seems a bit of a non-starter here.\n\nAnd finally, also taking a look at Synopsys shares jumping as the software company is set to buy Ansys for $35 billion in the biggest tech deal of the year so far. Now this will be a cass-and-stock deal that values Ansys at over $390 a share, which is a 35% premium on the company's 60 day volume-weighted average price as of December 21. Now the deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025.\n\nOf course, it is still very early in 2024 as we say this is the biggest tech deal. So it's still very early in the gates here, and a lot of people wondering what is going to be happening with M&A activity. So interesting to see this here. I mean, the company deals in a lot of different products and services, including tennis rackets. So it'll be interesting to see how this benefits them, how this plays out for them, but at least a hint of some positive M&A activity ahead.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, not just the largest M&A deal so far in the year, which is just a few weeks old, but really the largest deal in recent years, certainly, a good harbinger of things to come when you think about it. This does create a design software giant as you described, Rachelle. So if anything, this really is about, is this a sign of that thaw that's coming with M&A deals potentially picking up some momentum here? You see Synopsis shares up more than 3.5% on this deal. So we'll continue to watch that to see where things go.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed a court order to take effect that could loosen Apple's grip on its lucrative iPhone app store, and potentially affect billions of dollars in revenue a year.\n\nThe justices rejected Apple's appeal of lower-court rulings that found some of Apple’s app store rules for apps purchased on more than 1 billion iPhones constitute unfair competition under California law.\n\nThe appeal stemmed from an antitrust lawsuit filed by Epic Games, maker of the popular Fortnite video game. Epic lost its broader claim that Cupertino, California-based Apple was violating federal antitrust law, and the justices also rejected Epic's appeal Tuesday.\n\nBut in turning away Apple's plea, the court lifted a hold on an order to allow app developers throughout the U.S. to insert links to other payment options besides its own within iPhone apps. That change would make it easier for developers to avoid paying Apple’s commissions.\n\nEpic, based in Cary, North Carolina, had claimed that Apple’s app store — which was launched in 2008, a year after the first iPhone went on sale — had turned into an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and competition while generating billions of dollars in profit for Apple.\n\nEpic tried to offer an alternative way to get its mobile app, attempting to evade the developer fees inside the app store, which collects a commission of 15% to 30% on subscriptions and other digital transactions.\n\nApple ousted Epic from its app store after it tried to get around restrictions that Apple says protect the security and privacy of iPhone users while also helping to recoup some of the investment that powers one of the world’s most ubiquitous devices.\n\nLast month, Epic won a jury trial against Google and its Play Store for apps on Android phones in a lawsuit mirroring its action against Apple. A federal judge still must determine what changes Google will have to make to its Play Store.",

        "title": "Global PC Shipments Jump in Q4: Can Sales Rebound in 2024?",
        "content": "The U.S. PC market is finally rebounding after witnessing a decline in sales for several quarters. Although year-over-year sales are still down, the good sign is that sales are rebounding as inflationary pressures ease and consumers’ confidence in the economy strengthens.\n\nAccording to the latest report from Gartner, global PC shipments totaled 63.3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2023, increasing for the first time after eight consecutive quarters of decline.\n\nFor the year, global PC shipments totaled 241.8 million units, down 14.8% year over year from 2022. Sales were dominated by the market leaders and the top six sellers held on to their positions. However, the performances were mixed.\n\nLenovo Group Limited LNVGY recorded solid year-over-year sales growth. LNVGY shipped 16,213 units and was the top seller with 25.6% of the market share.\n\nHP Inc. HPQ held the second spot. HPQ shipped 13,954 units. HP has a market share of 22%, which is up year over year from 20.9%.\n\nDell Technologies Inc DELL held the third position. DELL shipped 9,983 units in the fourth quarter of 2023. Dell Technologies commanded 15.8% of the market share in the fourth quarter, down from 17.2% a year ago.\n\nApple, Inc. AAPL shipped6,349 units and held the fourth position. AAPL had a market share of 10% in the fourth quarter, up from 9.4% a year ago. Apple has a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAnalysts believe that PC sales are finally picking up, and demand and supply are finally balanced.\n\n“The PC market has hit the bottom of its decline after significant adjustment,” Mikako Kitagawa, Director Analyst at Gartner, said.\n\n“Inventory was normalized in the fourth quarter of 2023, which had been an issue plaguing the industry for two years. This subtle growth suggests that demand and supply are finally balanced. However, this situation will likely change due to the anticipated component price hike [in] 2024, as well as geopolitical and economic uncertainties,” Mikako added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe PC market took a hit in 2022 as soaring commodity prices started taking a toll on consumer spending. Consumers started spending cautiously and cut down on expensive items as the Federal Reserve launched its monetary tightening campaign to bring down 40-year high inflation.\n\nThis saw the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022, which finally started paying off late last year as inflation declined sharply.\n\nThis once again saw demand rebounding. The picture looks a lot brighter for the PC market now. According to a recent forecast by Canalys, PC shipments are projected to hit 267 million in 2024, an increase of 8% from 2023, as the global economy improves and users consider upgrading to Windows 11.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 AR Stocks to Bet On Ahead of Apple’s Vision Pro Release",
        "content": "Over the last few years, investors have become increasingly interested in the idea of virtual reality (VR), or augmented reality (AR), as a broad opportunity. The emergence of the metaverse during the pandemic served to heat up conversation around the topic. And the apparent opportunity has only become clearer as the technology has developed. With this, AR stocks are on the rise.\n\nWith an expected CAGR above 24% between 2024 and 2029, the virtual reality market and stocks therein are very attractive. There’s also more immediate news that will inspire investors in the coming weeks – Apple is set to release its Vision Pro in early February. Its release will prompt greater interest in the sector overall and is a great reason for investors to consider directing money into these firms at the moment.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nThe News that Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro will be on store shelves on Feb. 2 makes it the most important stock in this conversation. The Vision Pro won’t contribute much to Apple’s fundamentals in the near term but that doesn’t mean it won’t serve to propel its shares higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe simple truth is that despite the Vision Pro’s high price of $3,499, sales aren’t expected to be particularly significant. Recent estimates suggest that Apple could sell about 1 million of the headsets in 2024. That means the company will only see a few billion dollars extra in revenues from The Vision Pro at best. Frankly, that doesn’t move the needle much for Apple due to its massive size.\n\nSo, why then should investors assume that the release of the Vision Pro will positively affect Apple’s share price? The most obvious answer is that sales could dramatically increase in the next few years, for one. In time, the Vision Pro could contribute significantly to Apple’s fundamental growth. And two, Apple has an incredibly strong track record of impactful product releases that tend to do very well.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) As Free Cash Flow Continues Rolling, So Will Facebook Stock\n\nSource: fyv6561 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has long been one of the leading names in the development of the virtual reality space. The company then known as Facebook acquired AR firm Oculus in 2014. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long been a strong proponent of virtual reality dating back beyond the metaverse branding pivot in 2021.\n\nBack in 2017 Zuckerberg announced at the Oculus Connect conference that he wanted to get 1 billion people in virtual reality. That was a bold assertion at the time given that the company had only sold roughly 1 million VR headsets at that point.\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg has not slowed down which was made all the more clear by the company’s brand pivot and renaming to Meta Platforms in late 2021. Fast forward a few years, and the company had sold more than 20 million VR headsets through early 2023.\n\nObviously 20 million is well short of 1 billion, but Meta Platforms is well positioned to chase that goal moving forward. Apple’s early February release of the Vision Pro 2 will rekindle interest in Meta Platforms as it chases that goal.\n\nUniversal Display Corporation (OLED) OLED screen representing OLED stock\n\nSource: Daniel Pieterson / Shutterstock.com\n\nUniversal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) supplies organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) that are critical to the manufacturer of VR/AR headsets. All kinds of companies including Sony (NYSE:SONY) and Apple use OLED in their headsets, making Universal Display Corporation an interesting stock to consider.\n\nInvestors should also note that Universal Display Corporation is positively regarded on Wall Street. Its shares currently benefit from an overall ‘buy’ rating and moved up from a lower ‘overweight’ rating just a month ago. The high target price among the 12 analysts with coverage suggests that OLED shares could rise by 50% in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nInformation regarding some of the company’s more than 5,500 current patents can be found here. The overall thrust, though, is clear – Universal Display Corporation is well positioned to benefit from licensing opportunities as the virtual reality space continues to develop. Companies like Sony and Apple will continue to purchase the rights to that technology. That truth is all the more pertinent as Apple gears up to release the Vision Pro in the coming weeks.\n\nUnity Software (U) The Unity Software website is displayed on a laptop screen. U stock\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) will continue to be an interesting stock to consider in the VR space for one simple fact: graphics are incredibly important to the success or failure of the entire sector. The company has developed software that allows developers to create the 3D images used throughout them. If those images are subpar, disaster is not far away.\n\nFor example, remember when Mark Zuckerberg and Meta Platforms first released their demos of the Metaverse? The graphics were downright childish and led to wide derision of the company’s Metaverse pivot. It wasn’t the end and that demo also did not fully represent the firm’s graphical capability. However, it does reinforce the idea that quality graphics are vitally important throughout the industry.\n\nMore to the point, Apple and Unity Software are already partners. The release of the Vision Pro in early February should serve to redirect investors again toward Unity software and its shares.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Unity Software, is a very important stock to consider in virtual reality in relation to the importance of graphics. Nvidia’s GPUs are known to be the very best and benefit from wide application in gaming consoles and PCs.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is that the world of virtual reality/mixed reality/augmented reality requires even better graphical capabilities. Users demand strong graphics first and foremost whereas graphics are less important in platform gaming. Nvidia has created a developer tool kit which is geared toward virtual reality.\n\nIn short, Nvidia’s graphical prowess is very well known at this point. The company clearly has a strong opportunity in the continued development of the virtual reality space and a highly established name overall. Its chips continue to be in high demand for multiple applications including virtual reality.\n\nFurther, Nvidia obviously has and will continue to have a massive opportunity in relation to artificial intelligence. Thus, its shares expose investors to multiple paths toward continued strong growth overall.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the largest tech companies in existence. Silicon Valley firms have a presence across almost any given area of technology. Thus, it shouldn’t surprise readers to understand that the company has a significant role in the development of virtual reality. MSFT stock is strong for many reasons with the VR opportunity serving to further bolster investor confidence.\n\nThat statement might seem a bit contradictory given recent news around Microsoft’s Windows VR headsets. The company announced in December that it was discontinuing those headsets, which have thus far been slower sellers relative to those of competitors throughout Silicon Valley.\n\nIt’s difficult to believe that Microsoft will scrap the project on a wholesale scale. The company’s HoloLens 2 has a wide enterprise level application. firms are using it to enhance productivity and capability in workplace situations. Despite some clear setbacks to date, anticipate that Microsoft will figure out a way to make money from future continued development of virtual reality. The company has shown a continued investment in the artificial intelligence space which only makes that possibility greater.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Is another firm that has a wide footprint across the technology sector. Like Microsoft, Qualcomm is a very well established player in Silicon Valley. Both stocks are very stable overall and are strong choices for investors looking to gain exposure to VR without substantial risk.\n\nLet’s begin with looking at the reasons to consider Qualcomm for the short to medium term. Most importantly, Qualcomm recently extended its contract with Apple through 2026. That contract provides Qualcomm with a lot of stability that eases prior concerns. As much as Apple would like to bring more of its chip production in house, it simply isn’t as easy as wishing it to be. Qualcomm continues to provide technology that Apple is incapable of replicating. The long and short of that truth is that Qualcomm will continue to be a steady stock in the coming years.\n\nIn short, Qualcomm is a very stable stock. That notion is reinforced by the fact that the company pays a dividend yielding roughly 2.3% last reduced more than two decades ago.\n\nAll of that said, Qualcomm is leveraging its well regarded Snapdragon chips for the development of virtual reality. Further, the company has developed its own virtual reality/augmented reality glasses. Qualcomm continues to be a strong stable stock overall and one that should benefit from increased interest following the release of the Vision Pro headset.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "If You'd Invest $350,000 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends",
        "content": "A group of technology giants dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" was responsible for a large proportion of the 26.3% gain in the S&P 500 last year. That's because their collective valuation of $12 trillion makes up 28% of the index, so they have a huge influence over the direction of the broader market.\n\nThese are the Magnificent Seven stocks, and how they performed in 2023: NVDA Total Return Price Chart\n\nThe Equal Weight S&P 500 index -- which assigns an identical weighting to all 500 stocks -- finished 2023 with a gain of just 11.5%. It highlights just how impactful the surging Magnificent Seven returns were on the actual S&P 500. If you didn't own that group of stocks last year, your portfolio probably lagged the market.\n\nBut it's not all about blockbuster gains, because some of the Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. I'm going to show you how much you could earn with a $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence, cloud computing, electric vehicles, and more\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies operate across every major segment of the technology sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the largest driver of value in 2023, which is why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the group higher. Its H100 and upcoming H200 data center chips are designed to process AI workloads, and demand continues to surge as more businesses seek to develop AI applications.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are some of the world's largest data center operators, and therefore some of Nvidia's biggest customers. They use those centralized data centers to deliver cloud services -- and the computing power necessary to develop AI -- to millions of businesses around the world. Plus, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet offer cloud customers a growing number of large language models (LLMs), which are the building blocks of many AI applications.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using AI to show more relevant content to each of its 3.1 billion monthly users. The company also created an LLM of its own called Llama, which is open source, so any developer can use it to build advanced AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) created its own LLM in-house, which it's using to develop an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT. It will pair nicely with the company's latest iPhone 15, because it's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads on-device. This will place AI at the fingertips of billions of people around the world.\n\nFinally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the world's leading electric vehicle company by sales up until the end of 2023, when it was edged out by China-based BYD. However, Tesla's future will likely be determined by the success of its AI-powered autonomous self-driving vehicle technology. It's yet to be publicly released, but it has the potential to transform the company's economics. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThree of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay dividends\n\nSome companies generate so much profit they can't possibly reinvest it all into their operations to fuel more growth, so they pay some of it to shareholders instead. Dividends are the most common form of distribution, and they usually come as quarterly cash payments.\n\nApple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that pay dividends. Each of them less than a 1% yield, which are the payouts investors can expect to receive annually, calculated based on the value of their holdings. MSFT Dividend Yield Chart\n\nYields often change. If a stock doubles, its yield will halve organically unless the company raises its dividend. It doesn't mean the payout shrinks in dollar terms, but it falls as a percentage of the value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers the highest yield, and while it seems small at face value, it translates to around $20 billion in dividend payments each year based on its current market capitalization of $2.8 trillion.\n\nIf you'd invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock) you would earn a dividend yield of 0.37% on $150,000, and no yield on the other $200,000. That translates to an effective yield of 0.18% on the $350,000, or an annual payment of $659.56.\n\nIt's a paltry sum given the yield investors can earn on cash in a savings account right now, but it's a nice bonus on top of the spectacular capital growth these stocks have delivered over the past year.\n\nDividends aren't the only form of distribution\n\nA dividend isn't the only way companies return money to shareholders. They can also execute stock buyback programs, where they purchase their own shares on the open market. Those shrink the number of available shares in circulation, which leads to a higher price per share.\n\nStock buybacks are preferable to dividends for many companies, because they give them the flexibility to distribute the money at a time of their choosing -- they aren't locked into paying out a specified sum each quarter.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven companies have active share repurchase programs, worth a combined $186.6 billion over the last 12 months. Tesla and Amazon are the two without active programs. AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nAre the Magnificent Seven stocks still a buy now?\n\nAs I touched on at the top, investors who didn't own the Magnificent Seven stocks in 2023 likely underperformed the S&P 500 index. The law of large numbers makes it somewhat counterintuitive to expect these enormous companies to continue delivering the best returns in the entire market, because it gets harder for them to grow their revenue and earnings each year.\n\nHowever, it so happens that the Magnificent Seven companies operate at the forefront of the fastest growing industries in the world. For any investor seeking exposure to technologies like AI, cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, or electric vehicles, it's nearly impossible to look past these stocks.\n\nDepending on which Wall Street forecast you rely on, AI alone could add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade. Each of the Magnificent Seven already has a foothold in the industry, and they will likely deploy their considerable financial resources to ensure they capture a large slice of the opportunity.\n\nTherefore, the Magnificent Seven will likely be a great place for investors to park their money for the long term, and any dividends earned are an added bonus.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "'Lackluster' iPhone 15 sales lead to downgrade and Apple losing $1 billion in market value in 1 day — as analyst predicts more of the same for iPhone 16\n\nA question for Apple fans: How much does Tim Long earn a year? While you won’t find the Barclays analyst’s salary in a Google search, one could argue that Long’s note to investors on Jan. 2 came with a $100 billion price tag.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds Take control of your finances in 2024: 5 money moves to start the new year off strong\n\nThat’s how much one of the world’s largest companies shed in value after he and the bank downgraded Apple stock to a “sell” and set a price target of $160 per share.\n\nThe reason? “Lackluster” sales of the iPhone 15 and the belief that the upcoming iPhone 16 might see more of the same, according to news outlets citing the note.\n\n“We see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,” the note contends.\n\nReading tea leaves\n\nThe fact is — and “fact” arguably excludes a $100 billion opinion based on a phone no one has seen — Long remains something of an outlier among his peers.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal roundup of Apple stock, as of Jan. 15, 20 analysts rate it a “buy” compared to the three who rate it a “sell,” a ratio of nearly seven to one. What’s more, Apple has met or exceeded analyst expectations for at least four consecutive quarters.\n\nIn investment parlance, Apple remains “overweight.” That means when you factor in the opinions of the 44 total analysts surveyed by the Journal and average them, the conclusion is that Apple stock should perform better in the future — not worse.\n\nRead more: Millions of Americans are in massive debt in the face of rising rates. Here's how to take a break from debt this month\n\nBut just as motorists love to rubberneck a wreck on the highway, the media loves a good headline. When Apple’s worth dropped $100 billion, it made for one astronomical number — and a sexy one. (Try comparing that to 20 analysts who still love the stock.)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe worrywarts may also ignore another meaningful number: Apple’s 52-week low dating to mid-January 2023. That was around $130 per share, meaning the stock remains roughly 38% higher than that low-water mark. What’s more, Long’s pessimistic target price of $160 is still about 19% above that price.\n\nThe point is that no matter how good an analyst Long or his colleagues may be — and he ranks in the top 3% of more than 8,000 Wall Street analysts, according to TipRanks — many different ways exist to weigh a company’s numbers and thus tell many contrasting stories.\n\nLong and short of it\n\nAs for Long’s speculating on the next iPhone’s feature set and how consumers will react? That’s an educated guess at best. Only the company itself has any idea what the next product might feature.\n\nOne last figure: $2.87 trillion. That’s how much the Journal says Apple is worth, or what Wall Street calls its “market capitalization.” And while Apple shed, as the Journal’s numbers indicate, approximately the combined worth of auto giants Ford and GM, that’s a compact car on a mammoth lot as Apple’s fortunes go — $100 billion amounts to roughly 3-4% of the tech giant’s value.\n\nSo take heart, worried investors. The overriding lesson, pun intended, is that investment is a long game, not a short headline. You want long? If Apple CEO Tim Cook decided to give away $100 million of Apple’s value per day, it would still take him more than 78 years to do it.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis Pennsylvania trio bought a $100K abandoned school and turned it into a 31-unit apartment building — how to invest in real estate without all the heavy lifting Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2024 The US dollar has lost 87% of its purchasing power since 1971: Learn how to diversify your portfolio by investing in the world’s most popular precious metal\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures ticked lower on Tuesday as Apple and Tesla shed 2% each, while investors looked ahead to results from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to gauge the health of capital markets and dealmaking.\n\nGoldman Sachs dipped 0.1% and Morgan Stanley 0.7% in thin premarket trading. Their earnings follow lower profits reported by Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase on Friday, as lenders grapple with special charges, job cuts and souring consumer loans.\n\nOf the 29 S&P 500 firms that have reported results as of Friday, 93.1% have beaten analysts' earnings expectations, according to LSEG data.\n\nWall Street finished the previous week higher as investors continue to price in a 70% chance of the U.S. Federal Reserve's first rate cut of at least 25 basis points in March - despite mixed signals from the latest inflation data and a lack of supporting voices among policymakers for a quick start to monetary policy easing.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, a voting member this year, said on Sunday that inflation could \"see-saw\" if policymakers cut interest rates too soon, warning that inflation's descent towards the central bank's 2% goal was likely to slow in the months ahead, according to a report.\n\nMarkets will also parse Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller's remarks, expected at 11:00 a.m. ET, for clues on his view on the timing for easing credit conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, UBS Global Research boosted its 2024 year-end target for the S&P 500 on Tuesday to 5,150, representing a nearly 8% upside from current levels.\n\nThe benchmark index has faced resistance in recent sessions to breach its highest intra-day level hit in January 2022.\n\nAt 5:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 189 points, or 0.50%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 27 points, or 0.56%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 119 points, or 0.7%.\n\nTesla shed 2.2% after CEO Elon Musk said he would be uncomfortable growing the automaker to be a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without having at least 25% voting control of the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple fell 1.8% after offering rare discounts on its iPhones in China on competition pressures, just days after the tech giant was overtaken by Microsoft as the world's most valuable firm.\n\nBoeing declined 2.6% as the Federal Aviation Administration extended the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX 9 airplanes indefinitely for new safety checks, and brokerage Wells Fargo downgraded the company to \"equal weight\" from \"overweight\".\n\nPayPal lost 2.1%. Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, received a money-transmitter license from Utah on Monday, as the company explores adding a payments feature to the social media platform.\n\nApplied Digital added 3.9% ahead of results.\n\nLater in the week, investors will also parse economic data like December retail sales and housing data.\n\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) dipped on Tuesday after analysts at Mizuho cut their rating of the fintech group to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" citing concerns that market share may be waning due to fierce competition from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) mobile payment platform.\n\nThe analysts flagged that this service -- known as Apple Pay -- is the biggest threat to PayPal's branded products, saying that it is driving a change in consumer checkout habits largely thanks to its presence on Apple's megapopular iPhone smart device.\n\n\"The iPhone has forced a shift from desktop (where [PayPal] has historically performed well) to mobile (where Apple is most prevalent and where [PayPal]'s checkout trends are weaker [versus] desktop),\" the Mizuho analysts wrote.\n\nThey added that worries remain over an \"emerging age demographic problem,\" noting that tech-savvy young consumers in the U.S. are tending to use newer payment methods like Apple Pay and \"buy now, pay later\" short-term financing. PayPal, they argued, is still a \"laggard in this respect\".\n\nCiting an internal study, the Mizuho analysts said that 31% of shoppers who prefer Apple Pay are aged 18-29, compared to 18% of PayPal users in that cohort. Meanwhile, just 29% of Apple Pay customers are aged 45 years or older versus nearly 50% of PayPal users.\n\n\"[T]his signals that each incremental consumer that enters the e-comm[erce] checkout market is much more likely to choose Apple Pay over [PayPal],\" the analysts claimed.\n\nIn response to the growing competition and margin pressures, California-based PayPal has recently moved to develop new revenue sources outside of solely transaction-based volumes. Chief Executive Alex Chriss said in November that the firm is working on a comprehensive plan for its 2024 fiscal year, including \"opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth while reducing our expenses.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPayPal shares slip after Mizuho analysts cut rating of payments group\n\nShell to exit Nigeria's troubled onshore oil after nearly a century\n\nBoeing needs more hands-on management, not resignations -Ryanair CEO",

        "content": "Apple supplier Goertek said on Monday it would invest up to US$280 million to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in Vietnam to meet demands for \"business expansion and long-term operation\" in the Southeast Asian nation, according to a corporate filing.\n\nGoertek's Vietnamese entity, which will manufacture consumer electronics products from AirPods and smartwatches to virtual reality and augmented reality gear, is a project that will meet both the Chinese assembler's future development plan and client demand, it said in the filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\n\n\"[The project] is advantageous to make better use of local resources in Vietnam to enhance the company's overall competitiveness,\" Goertek said.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nGoertek has been tapped by Apple to become one of the major mainland suppliers of its mixed reality Vision Pro headset, which is set to launch in early February.\n\nThe Vietnamese subsidiary, which will be set up through its Hong Kong entity Goertek (Hong Kong) Co, is expected to be located in the Bac Ninh province, which has attracted investment from a raft of South Korean firms including consumer electronics and semiconductor giant Samsung Electronics.\n\nSouth Korean firms have emerged as major investors in the Vietnamese province, setting up factories for electronics, smartphone, semiconductor and precision mechanical manufacturing, according to the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nGoertek's latest move comes as Apple is starting to shift more of its production outside China, a move that came after Beijing's stringent Covid-19 restrictions during the pandemic disrupted Apple's supply chain, impacting its global sales in the lead up to the Christmas shopping season in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince then, Apple has encouraged its manufacturing partners to diversify into other countries, including Vietnam, to reduce its reliance on China.\n\nApple suppliers, including Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, have invested up to US$16 billion to reduce their dependence on China, by relocating facilities to India, Vietnam, Mexico as well as the US, according to a report by AppleInsider, citing research by investment bank TD Cowen.\n\nLate last year, Foxconn, the biggest maker of iPhones, announced a plan to invest US$1.6 billion in India to expand its presence in the South Asian nation.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

How Scientists Are Preparing for the Next Pandemic Apple to Pull Blood-Oxygen Tool From Watches to Avoid US Ban If Appeal Fails\n\nThe plan was disclosed Monday by Masimo Corp., which has been locked in a feud with Apple over patents related to the technology. It said that US Customs and Border Protection approved the move on Jan. 12. The agency “decided that Apple’s redesign falls outside the scope” of an import ban by the US International Trade Commission, signaling that the adjustment will let Apple keep its watches on the market.\n\nThe ITC had ruled in October that Apple’s devices violated Masimo patents related to blood-oxygen measurement. That led Apple to pause sales of the smartwatches just ahead of Christmas, though an interim stay allowed the company to bring the products back late last month.\n\nThe iPhone maker developed a software workaround intended to sidestep the dispute and presented the solution last week to the customs agency, which is in charge of enforcing import bans. Apple explained that the redesigned watches “definitively” do not contain the technology at issue, known as pulse oximetry, according to Masimo.\n\nThe dramatic step would probably only take place if Apple fails to win a longer stay from a federal appeals court. The company said Monday it expects the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to rule on its motion for a stay for the entire appeal period as early as Tuesday. The company said it believes the period could last a year or more.\n\nUntil then, the Apple Watch blood-oxygen feature continues to be available on newly sold units, the Cupertino, California-based company said. The customs agency hasn’t publicly published its decision, but shared it with the parties.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Apple’s claim that its redesigned watch does not contain pulse oximetry is a positive step toward accountability,” Masimo said. “It is especially important that one of the world’s largest and most powerful companies respects the intellectual property rights of smaller companies and complies with ITC orders when it is caught infringing.”\n\nRemoving the technology from the Apple Watch would be significant move. The company’s engineers have been working on a software update that changes the blood-oxygen app and its algorithms in a way that might circumvent the issue without losing the feature. But eliminating the capability would likely be the quickest way to avoid seeing the ban reimposed, which could have occurred as early as this month.\n\n“Apple may have paid a steep price to get around a US import ban,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tamlin Bason said in a note. “That was a highly touted feature.”\n\nThough addressing the immediate risk of a ban is positive, the move “could dent customer demand,” Bason said.\n\nApple’s operations team has already begun shipping modified Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches to retail locations in the US, likely in case the appeal fails this week. The stores were told not to open or sell the tweaked devices until they receive approval from Apple’s corporate offices. It’s possible that those models are the new versions without the blood-oxygen feature.\n\nSeparately, a federal appeals court is expected to hear an Apple motion as early as this week for a continued stay on the ban. The prohibition was overturned on an emergency basis while Apple waits for a hearing. Last week, the ITC urged an appeals court to reject “weak and unconvincing” arguments supporting a bid to block the trade agency’s enforcement of the ban.\n\n(Updates with company comments starting in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal How AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top Priority Trumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election Five ETFs to Watch in 2024 Kim Kardashian’s Skims Isn’t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "The work-from-home (WFH) phenomenon has faded tremendously, as many companies, large and small, are ordering their employees to spend at least a few days per week in the office. For example, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) are among the huge companies ending or greatly curtailing WFH privileges. As a result, many companies that benefited from the WFH trend are taking sizeable hits to their top and bottom lines. Although the increase in interest rates is certainly the main reason the demand for single-family homes has dropped tremendously, I believe the demise of the WFH trend has also played a sizeable role in causing the demand for such houses to decline. After all, the situation in which many workers from high-tax states could live anywhere in the country and still keep their jobs is over. I believe the latter situation, in turn, has caused the demand for houses in many low-tax states to drop a great deal. Finally, the demand for many types of computer hardware and software previously used by employees working from home has declined. Here are three work-from-home stocks to sell.\n\nZillow (Z) The Zillow logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nZillow (NASDAQ:Z) provides advertising to real estate agents and originates mortgages. In October 2023, the company itself reported worker interest in “work-from-home zones” like a “cloffice” (a combination between a closet and an office) or a Zoom room sunk significantly.\n\nNot coincidentally, I believe, Zillow’s operating income in the 12 months that ended in September 2023 came in at -$227 million, down from -$69 million in all of 2022 and $259 million in all of 2021.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the firm’s residential revenue sunk to $362 million in the third quarter from $372 million during the same period a year earlier.\n\nAlthough the company will be helped somewhat by a likely decline in interest rates in 2024, lower prices and the continued demise of the WFH trend will, I believe, combine to push Z stock down this year. Consequently, I view it as one of the top work-from-home stocks to sell.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple benefited in multiple ways from the WFH trend. People who spend much more time at home tend to be more focused on software, including Apple TV, Apple Music and Cloud services — the company’s Services sector.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter of 2021, for example, the tech giant’s revenue from Services soared 33% versus the same period a year earlier. Conversely, in the quarter that ended last September, Apple’s Services revenue climbed 8.2% year-over-year.\n\nWFH also boosted Apple’s hardware sales, as employees bought many more devices to use from home. In the quarter ending in September 2021, its revenue from iPads came in at $8.3 billion. In the quarter that ended in September 2023, the device only generated $6.4 billion in sales. Meanwhile, its Mac revenue dropped from $9.1 billion to $7.6 billion.\n\nWith the WFH trend further eroding, so will Apple’s top and bottom lines, along with AAPL stock.\n\nZoom Video (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the WFH trend winding down, videoconferencing provider Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) has found growth hard to come by. For example, in the third quarter of last year, its top line only increased 3% versus the same period a year earlier.\n\nThat makes sense, since, as WFH winds down, companies are utilizing more face-to-face meetings and fewer Zoom sessions.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams software reportedly caught up to Zoom’s offerings in terms of functionality, leaving Zoom vulnerable to market share losses.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Melissa Lawford has the details:\n\nCrest Nicholson’s share price dropped by as much as 5pc on Monday after the housebuilder slashed its profit forecasts by nearly a fifth, on top of an earlier downgrade in August.\n\nIn an unscheduled trading update on Monday, Crest Nicholson said it expected its profits before tax in the year to October would now be £41m. This will be 44pc less than the £73.7m the housebuilder had initially forecast in June last year.\n\nAnthony Codling, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the warnings could make Crest Nicholson a target for a takeover.\n\nMr Codling said: “If today’s trading update leads to further share price weakness it could increase the chances of Crest being viewed as an attractive acquisition for another housebuilder.”\n\nMonday’s update followed an earlier announcement in August, when Crest Nicholson cut its profit forecast to £50m. In November, it said it expected profits would be in the range of £45m to £50m.\n\nThis followed an £11m jump in costs on Crest Nicholson’s Brightwells Yard development in Farnham, Surrey, in the six months to October.\n\nOn Monday, Crest Nicholson said it had now identified further costs on this project as well as other legacy sites.\n\nIn an investor note, Barclays warned of ongoing uncertainty about future costs.

James Titcomb reports:\n\nChinese consumers are being offered discounts of as much as 500 yuan (£55) on iPhones and up to 800 yuan on MacBook laptops, with more price cuts on other devices.\r\n\r\nThe discounts, which will apply this weekend, are being presented as a promotion ahead of the Chinese new year in February, but come amid questions about demand for iPhones in China that have hit the company’s shares in recent weeks.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world’s most valuable listed company for the first time in two years following a 6pc fall in the iPhone maker’s shares in the last month.\r\n\r\nAnalysts at Jefferies said last week that iPhone sales were currently falling by as much as 30pc on the same period last year and predicted they would drop by 10pc over 2024.\r\n\r\nThe apparent sales drop could potentially send Apple to a fifth consecutive quarter of declining revenue for the first time since 1998.\r\n\r\nThe drop has been partly attributed to strong demand for Huawei’s Mate 60 phone. The Chinese company appears to have overcome US sanctions designed to crush its smartphone business by developing made-in-China components for the device.\r\n\r\nWhile Apple has previously offered discounts ahead of the Chinese new year, which is a key shopping season, it rarely does so for its latest iPhones. A 500 yuan discount on the iPhone 15, released last year, would save as much as 8pc.\r\n\r\nSales in China account for around a sixth of Apple’s total.\n\n03:37 PM GMT\n\nOctopus Energy takes equity stake in swimming pool data centre business\n\nOctopus Energy has taken an equity stake in a startup business that believes in locating small data centres in the same buildings as swimming pools.

Octopus says that a public swimming pool in Devon was able to slash its pool heating bill by over 60pc by allowing Deep Green to co-locate a data centre. Deep Green meanwhile gets free cooling which, Octopus says, provides it with a competitive edge over other data centres.\n\nThe company also wants to provide heat to district heat networks, which supply hot water to buildings.\n\nAccording to a company statement, Octopus is planning to invest £200m in scaling the idea.\n\nDeep Green’s most recent published accounts, to Sept 30 2022, show that it had cash of £13,134 and a shareholders’ deficit of £142,974.

        "title": "Will Apple (AAPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Apple (AAPL), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry.\n\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.46%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Apple was expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share, but it reported $1.46 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.04%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.19 per share, while it actually produced $1.26 per share, a surprise of 5.88%.\n\nFor Apple, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +3.65% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 1, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) isn't just another tech buzzword; it's a groundbreaking force, reshaping our lives and businesses. In a memorable blog post from the spring of 2023, Microsoft founder Bill Gates compared AI's game-changing powers to the introduction of the internet and the mobile phone:\n\nIt will change the way people work, learn, travel, get healthcare, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.\n\nAnd Gates is not a lone voice in the wilderness. For instance, futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil respectfully dissented when asked to sign an open letter calling for a pause in high-powered AI research. \"There are tremendous benefits to advancing AI in critical fields such as medicine and health, education, pursuit of renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels, and scores of other fields,\" Kurzweil wrote.\n\nThe renowned scientist, serving as Alphabet's director of engineering since 2012, saw this revolution coming decades ago. Kurzweil used to believe that affordable household-level computers would eclipse human brain power around the year 2020. That deadline has moved to 2045 or thereabouts, but \"humanity 2.0\" is still coming. You can't stop progress -- you can only hope to contain it.\n\nThe world is changing before our eyes, and the next generation of humans will co-exist with AI-powered computers in a whole new way. These sea changes are rare and extremely powerful. Experts like Gates and Kurzweil argue that AI is the next truly game-changing technology.\n\nSo it's high time to prepare for what's next. For investors like you and me, that means grabbing a diversified basket of promising AI stocks. Here's why SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) and IBM(NYSE: IBM) would be helpful components of that basket.\n\nSoundHound: Making the leap from tunes to tech\n\nYou may know SoundHound for its music identification app. You know the drill -- play a few seconds of any song into your smartphone's microphone, give SoundHound another couple of seconds to find sonic patterns in that sample, and get data such as the song title, artist, composer, and lyrics.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivals like Shazam (now a part of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)) and Deezer work by \"fingerprinting\" the audio and matching the result to a database of known signatures. SoundHound's AI-based system digs deeper into the characteristics of the track before matching a more sophisticated range of patterns. For example, SoundHound can isolate the melody line, allowing you to find tunes by singing or humming into your phone -- in the wrong key, at an unexpected tempo, or in a noisy environment. Shazam's simpler approach can't do that.\n\nBut song-ID services are not terribly lucrative, so SoundHound has expanded its focus around the core expertise of AI-powered audio analysis. So SoundHound built a powerful audio recognition engine known as Houndify around its years of song-focused research and oodles of data from those 10-second samples. The company quickly found clients in the automotive industry and consumer electronics. More recently, SoundHound launched voice-driven tools for restaurant management.\n\nNow, SoundHound is a direct bet on AI technology delivering superior results to more traditional consumer-facing systems. You'll run across automated Houndify interactions at drive-through windows and in call center phone menus. If you've gotten used to telling your car what radio station to play or what temperature you want in the air conditioning, you may very well use SoundHound's Houndify every day without knowing it.\n\nAnd this little company is going places. SoundHound's trailing revenues stood at $19.6 million in the summer of 2022, just after its initial public offering (IPO). It has nearly doubled since then to $38.2 million. The company is unprofitable so far but getting closer to the breakeven point in every quarter. Furthermore, the stock isn't exactly setting the world on fire. SoundHound's shares have traded sideways since November 2022, despite the AI boom of 2023.\n\nI expect big things from SoundHound AI as it continues to expand into new target markets while refining its pricing and profits. In a worst-case scenario, the company could be a buyout target for some tech giant without a credible audio analysis platform. But ideally, this undervalued growth stock should have room to run higher for many years as a stand-alone business.\n\nIBM: Not your grandpa's old-school tech giant anymore\n\nBig Blue is a long-standing leader in the tech industry, with a trend-setting presence in the AI segment through its Watson platform. This AI system, famous for winning \"Jeopardy!\" and beating the world champion of chess in 1999, has evolved into a powerful tool for business analytics and cloud services. IBM is happy to leave consumer-grade AI tools to other companies, focusing on business-grade services instead.\n\nIBM's shift to hybrid cloud computing and AI-focused strategies under CEOs Ginni Rometty and Arvind Krishna signals a commitment to remaining relevant in the rapidly advancing tech landscape.\n\nThe company's recent financials show a steady trajectory, with a renewed focus on high-margin cloud and AI services. Sales are up by 7% over the last two years while free cash flows rose 15% and diluted earnings per share jumped 50% higher. These positive trends include an inflation-driven dip in 2022: IBM Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThis pivot positions IBM as a stable and promising investment in the AI field, backed by a legacy of innovation and a clear vision for the future. And investors seem to have forgotten about IBM's robust AI chops amid the recent boom. Big Blue's stock trades at a bargain-bin valuation of 12.5 times free cash flows and 22 times earnings, having gained a below-par 14% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nIf you're looking for a powerful AI stock without the lofty trillion-dollar price tags of market darlings like Nvidia or Microsoft, IBM strikes me as a top idea today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "M&amp;A Watch: 3 Tech Stocks With ‘Takeover Target’ Potential",
        "content": "With even the Federal Reserve’s hawks like John Williams indicating that the central bank is done raising rates for the foreseeable future, the outlook for rates has become much more certain. As a result, companies are becoming more comfortable borrowing the funds needed to acquire other firms. Given the latter situation, I expect mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the tech sector to take off tremendously this year. Indicating this phenomenon has already started, Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) earlier this month announced it agreed to acquire telecom and data center equipment provider Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) for $40 per share. Before the deal was disclosed, JNPR stock was changing hands for around $30 per share. Now, it’s selling for about $37.51. Here are three other potential takeover targets in the tech sector that can generate much bigger profits for investors.\n\nExtreme Networks (EXTR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike Juniper, Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR) sells equipment to data centers. Among Extreme’s offerings are wide area-network infrastructure equipment and a cloud network management solution.\n\nThe proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) is greatly increasing the utilization of data centers since the lion’s share of the data used by AI systems is stored there. What’s more, AI systems are usually created in data centers. Given these points, the demand for data center equipment should jump over the longer term, making EXTR one of the more attractive takeover targets in the tech sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso noteworthy is that analysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to climb to $1.24 in 2024 from $1.09 in 2023, while EXTR stock has a very attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 12.5.\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve long believed that Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), with its sizable captive streaming audience, would make one of the best takeover targets for a struggling media company.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith cord-cutting having greatly weakened the cable ecosystem and multiple media firms struggling to compete against Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the streaming space, a takeover of Roku has become more attractive than ever for many media players.\n\nFor example, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) could both advertise their streaming offerings and other products frequently on Roku if they decide to buy the streaming operating system provider. With Apple and Disney struggling to generate strong growth, I believe they may finally shell out the large amount of funds needed to buy Roku.\n\nIndeed, the one drawback to acquiring Roku is the buyer would probably have to pay at least $25 billion to get the deal done. Still, besides Apple and Disney, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could afford that price relatively easily.\n\nFive9 (FIVN) photo illustration of the Five9 logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFive9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) is well-positioned to benefit from the incorporation of AI into its customer-contact products.\n\nAfter meeting with the firm’s management in November, investment bank Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) wrote that Five9 could get a big boost from selling its AI-enabled products to large companies. Additionally, Piper believes the firm, over the longer term, can benefit from “tech and channel partnerships” along with acquiring important security certification from the federal government.\n\nThese growth catalysts likely caused Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) to attempt buying the company recently. ZM ultimately backed out, but other firms could easily look to buy Five9.\n\nFIVN stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 36, while analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to jump to $1.93 this year from $1.50 in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Top-rated AI stocks enjoyed a dominant 2023 as more investors realized the potential of this technology. But, when stocks experience significant rallies, it’s easy to wonder if they are due for corrections.\n\nMany AI stocks have continued to perform well in 2024, including some of the picks on this list. However, some AI stocks have missed out on the fun and look more reasonably valued given the sector’s fanfare.\n\nSome investors turn to Wall Street analysts to gauge whether they should buy a stock or stay away from it. Analysts study stocks for a living and have a better grasp on what to look. Investors looking to get more exposure to top-rated AI stocks may want to consider these Wall Street favorites.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) 3D rendering of a female robot looking very sad. Dark background. AI stocks are down. AI Stocks. doomed AI Stocks\n\nSource: Sarah Holmlund / Shutterstock.com\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a surging AI stock that has won praise from many analysts. The software and service provider has an average price target of $361.33 which implies an almost 7% upside. The median price target is $400 while the high is $500.\n\nThe company’s data center servers can process the high intensity of artificial intelligence. A partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) bodes well for the company and can fuel more revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe stock outperformed Nvidia and most of the competition over the past year. Shares surged by over 300% during that time and are up by nearly 2,164% over the past five years. Shares currently trade at a 31 P/E ratio.\n\nSupermicro started fiscal 2024 with 14.4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. The company raised its fiscal 2024 outlook from $10 billion to $11 billion in revenue. The ongoing GPU supply constraints have not stopped the company from growing. Once this headwind fades away, hypergrowth may resume.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) is an undervalued semiconductor stock that offers ion implantation technology. Instead of making chips, the company assists chipmakers with making more efficient chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts Purion systems have experienced robust demand with order backlog exceeding the company’s revenue for all of 2022. The significant backlog is present in the context of booming revenue and earnings growth.\n\nIn the third quarter, revenue increased by 27.6% year-over-year while net income jumped by 63.7% year-over-year. The stock has been battered in recent months without much news to warrant the decline. Shares now trade at a 16 P/E ratio which looks like a bargain.\n\nThe stock has an average price target of $183 among five analysts. That price target implies a 60% upside from the current price. The highest price target is $215 while the lowest price target is $134. Even the lowest price target still suggests the stock can rally by 17.5% from here.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia seems to attract fans left and right while converting most, if not all, of its bearish investors. Any stock with a 209% gain over the past year and a 5-year gain of 1,295% is bound to draw attention.\n\nThe valuation was one of the few concerns investors had about the stock. However, Nvidia has silenced valuation concerns with stellar revenue and earnings growth. Revenue grew by 206% year-over-year while net income soared by 1,259% year-over-year. Investors don’t come across those types of numbers often.\n\nIt’s the first time I’ve seen a company achieve those growth rates for multiple quarters, and Nvidia isn’t even a microcap. The tech giant’s market cap exceeded $1 trillion in 2023 and it’s not a stretch to say that this company’s market cap can exceed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) within a few years.\n\nThere’s been a lot of AI hype, but Nvidia’s financial strength comes with a 28-forward P/E ratio and a 0.55 PEG ratio. There’s a lot to like about the stock, and analysts seem to agree. The average price target of $662 suggests a 21% upside from the current price. This average price target comes from 35 analysts.

        "content": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke about the company's vision for AI at Chatham House, in London, on Monday. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will displace jobs but remains optimistic about the impact even as the IMF warned that almost 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of AI.\n\nNadella told an audience at London’s Chatham House on Monday that every big technological revolution displaces jobs but that the technology will help develop new career skills.\n\n“There will be jobs, the question is the shape of these jobs. If anything, these tools can be very helpful with getting us the skills for what is the new set of tasks,” he said.\n\n“Everyone can become an expert in anything because they have an AI assistant,” he added.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that AI is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs. The organisation said the impact will be greater for advanced economies, with around 60% of roles affected.\n\nRead more: LIVE: FTSE 100 hovers with AI in the spotlight as global leaders head to Davos\n\nAbout half of those workers will benefit from the integration of AI, which could boost productivity, but the remainder could see lower salaries, reduced hiring and, “in the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear”, according to the IMF.\n\n“In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said.\n\nNadella has made a push for Microsoft to assume a global leadership role in AI. The company has a significant stake in leading AI startup ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, and reportedly invested up to $13bn in the startup. This alliance has been considered one of the tech industry’s most lucrative tie-ups.\n\nMicrosoft pushed for OpenAi’s chief executive Sam Altman to be reinstated after a messy corporate dispute in November.\n\nNadella and Altman are both scheduled to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI has allowed it to roll out Copilot, an AI enabled software assistant.\n\nGoing even further, a new Copilot key will ship on a variety of new PCs and laptops from Microsoft’s partners, providing quick access to Copilot straight from a keyboard button press.\n\nThe Copilot key is the first big change to the Windows PC keyboard layout in nearly three decades.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Crest Nicholson, PageGroup, Baidu and United Airlines\n\nThe hype around AI has allowed Microsoft to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the most valuable company in the world.\n\nOn Friday, Microsoft’s market capitalisation stood at $2.887tn, a new record high for the company, and above Apple’s market cap of $2.875tn.\n\nThe last time the software giant earned the title of most valuable company in the world was back in 2021.\n\nRead more: Microsoft topples Apple to become global market cap leader\n\nShares in Microsoft climbed over 50% in 2023 and analysts expect AI to take it even higher this year.\n\nOther AI-focused tech players such as Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet ( GOOG), also witnessed a big jump in their market cap in the past year, Reuters reported.\n\nAt Chatham House, Nadella also said that he is \"sanguine\" about the risk AI poses to political elections.\n\n“Election interference existed before AI,” the Microsoft CEO said, adding that the world can learn from these past election cycles.\n\nWatch: Apple & Microsoft: The future of AI in consumer tech<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AAPL</a>) and Microsoft (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">MSFT</a>) at CES 2024 (Consumer Electronics Show) as, for a brief moment, Microsoft took over <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-briefly-overtakes-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-before-apple-takes-back-crown-165431534.html\\\">as the most valuable company</a> for the first time since 2021.

        "title": "If You Can Only Buy One Blue-Chip Stock in January, It Better Be One of These 7 Names",
        "content": "If you’re looking for reliability, you can’t go wrong with most of the blue-chip stocks.\n\nYou get proven businesses that have stood the test of time. Better, you’re investing in a company that’s not likely to go out of business any time soon. All because most offer products and services millions of us use every day. Plus, with many of the top blue-chip stocks you can even collect yield from them along the way.\n\nLook at AT&T (NYSE:T), for example. After a miserable year for the telecom stock, I mentioned it as a beaten-down blue-chip stock opportunity on Nov. 17. At the time, it traded at $15.60. Not long after, it would hit a high of $17.47, with a near 7% yield to boot.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition to AT&T, here are some other top blue-chip stocks you can buy on the cheap.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Southwest Airlines (LUV) Southwest Airlines logo on aircraft that is taking off from McCarran in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nSource: Eliyahu Yosef Parypa / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Nov. 17, I also highlighted an opportunity in Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), as it traded at $24.50.\n\nAt the time, I noted, “the airline stock plummeted to a low of $22.01 – a low it hasn’t seen since 2014. However, with a good deal of negativity priced into the stock, the pullback appears a bit overdone.” Not long after, LUV would hit $29.84 and could see higher highs. Better, as we wait for further recovery, we can collect its current yield of 2.41%.\n\nHelping, analysts at Susquehanna just raised their price target to $30 from $23 on the LUV stock. “The firm believes 2024 is setting up to be a year where idiosyncratic factors drive absolute and relative stock returns for the airlines, with network exposure, the ‘premiumization’ of travel, fleets and order books, labor, service, and cost control driving the investment narratives and debates,” as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) the front wheels of a series of cars in a line\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nI also highlighted Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) on Nov. 17, as it traded at around $136. While it’s only up to $138.43, give it time. I still believe it could refill its bearish gap around $147.50, with patience. Plus, as we wait for that to happen, we can collect its yield of 2.75%. There’s nothing wrong with getting paid to wait – especially with a top blue-chip stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, earnings haven’t been anything to write home about, but most of that negativity has been priced into the stock. In its most recent quarter, the company posted third quarter EPS of $2.49, which beat expectations by seven cents. Unfortunately, revenue of $5.82 billion – up 2.5% year-over-year – did miss by $90 million.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaper. Blue-Chip Stocks at Low\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there’s always an exchange-traded fund to buy into. With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG) invests at least 80% of its funds in blue chip companies. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and many more of the biggest, most well-respected stocks on the market.\n\nSince the end of October, the ETF did run from about $27.50 to a high of $33.70. At its current price, it has become slightly over-extended and could see a healthy pullback. So, you may want to wait for that to happen before jumping in. Longer-term, I’d like to see it closer to $40.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also Nike (NYSE:NKE).\n\nOver the last few weeks, the stock gapped from about $122.85 to $105.90. All on news of concerning sales outlook. However, it looks like most of that negativity has been priced in, with the stock attempting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. The last time these indicators became this oversold, NKE bounced from about $89 to $122.85. From its current price of $105.90, I’d like to see it refill its gap around $122.85 again soon.\n\nBetter, while we wait for NKE to recover, we can collect its yield of 1.4%. Furthermore, analysts at Truist just raised their price target on NKE to $111 from $107. Citi analysts have also called the pullback a buying opportunity, with a $135 price target.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe can also look at Realty Income (NYSE:O), which pays out a monthly dividend, and carries a current yield of 5.19%.  Most recently, the company declared its 643rd consecutive monthly dividend of $0.2565 per share, or $3.078 annualized, payable on Feb. 15 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 1.\n\nNot only is Realty Income a reliable, dividend-paying realty powerhouse, it’s been around for more than 50 years now. Better, it has 13,100 properties, and it’s still seeing strong demand with an occupancy rate of 99%. Some of its top tenants include Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreen’s (NASDAQ:WBA), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), BJ’s (NYSE:BJ), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) to name just a few.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA household name, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share, payable on Feb. 15 to shareholders of record, as of Jan. 19. According to the company, “P&G has been paying a dividend for 133 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890 and has increased its dividend for 67 consecutive years.”\n\nPlus, as a barometer of consumer strength, its earnings have been solid, too.  In its most recent quarter, the company posted core earnings of $1.83 a share on revenue of $21.9 billion. Analysts were only looking for $1.72 on $21.6 billion in sales.\n\n“We delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, putting us on track to deliver towards the higher end of our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales and core EPS growth,” said Jon Moeller, the company’s chairman and CEO.\n\nIn the long term, PG will remain one of the strongest, dividend-paying blue-chip stocks to own.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nOne of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) delivers growth, reliability, and dividends. With a yield of 3.08%, the company recently paid out a 46-cent dividend on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record as of Dec. 1. I expect to hear of a newer dividend shortly.\n\nEarnings have been solid, too. In its most recent quarter, the company earned 74 cents a share on revenue of $11.95 billion. That was well ahead of expectations for 69 cents and revenue of $11.4 billion. Better, the company expects to grow organic sales by 10% to 11% from prior guidance of 8% to 9%, as noted by Barron’s contributor Teresa Rivas.\n\nHelping, analysts at Citi just raised their price target on KO to $67 with a buy rating. Deutsche Bank raised its price target to $62, with a hold rating. And analysts at Argus just named KO as its top 2024 pick.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Microsoft MSFT has emerged as the most valuable publicly traded company in the United States at the close of Friday's trading session, surpassing Apple AAPL. This shift follows a brief period during intraday trading on Thursday when Microsoft temporarily overtook the iPhone maker in terms of market capitalization.\n\nFor over a year, Apple had held the title of the most valuable public company, with only brief periods when Saudi Aramco and Microsoft temporarily took the top position. Microsoft's shares saw an increase of more than 3% over the course of the week, pushing the company's market capitalization to $2.89 trillion. Conversely, Apple experienced a drop of over 3% in its stock value during the same period, resulting in a decrease in its valuation to $2.87 trillion.\n\nAnalyst Downgrade for Apple\n\nRedburn Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell downgraded Apple from a \"buy\" to a \"neutral\" rating on Wednesday, citing concerns about limited upside potential in iPhone growth and expectations of an underwhelming performance in the March quarter, as quoted on CNBC. Apple announced on Thursday that former Vice President Al Gore would retire from the company's board next month after serving as a director since 2003.\n\nConfidence in Microsoft's AI Capabilities\n\nMicrosoft received a vote of confidence on Thursday as it showcased its artificial intelligence capabilities to developers at an event in San Francisco. Piper Sandler analysts expressed optimism about the momentum surrounding Microsoft's most mature AI products and noted an increase in GitHub website traffic for three consecutive months year over year. These analysts have provided a favorable rating equivalent to a \"buy\" for Microsoft shares.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 36 analysts, the average price target for Microsoft comes to $408.34. The forecasts range from a low of $232.00 to a high of $600.00. The average price target represents an increase of 6.16% from the last closing price of $384.63.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 25 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $205.15. The forecasts range from a low of $160.00 to a high of $250.00. The average price target represents an increase of 10.54%from the last closing priceof $185.59.\n\nMicrosoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.23 a month ago based on 39 recommendations. Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.88 on a scale of 1 to 5.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nThe duel between the two tech giants has put focus on tech ETFs having the largest exposure to these companies.

        "title": "Almost Half of Warren Buffett-Led Berkshire Hathaway's $358 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock",
        "content": "Given Warren Buffett's world-famous reputation as one of the greatest investors ever, it's no surprise that individual investors look at his company's public equities portfolio to find stock market inspiration.\n\nTake a peek at Berkshire Hathaway's massive $358 billion portfolio, and you'll quickly realize Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) makes up 47% of the entire value of its holdings as of this writing. It's not difficult to see why. Berkshire first started buying the iPhone maker in early 2016, and from the start of that year to now, the stock has skyrocketed 600%.\n\nLet's first look at the factors that drew Buffett to Apple. Then, we can figure out whether the shares are a smart investment today.\n\nWhat's there not to like about this business?\n\nWarren Buffett has historically avoided businesses in the tech sector. However, he has made a few exceptions with Apple being the most notable. Apple is an incredibly powerful consumer electronics brand after all, and the Oracle of Omaha is very familiar with this key competitive advantage, as demonstrated by his other longtime holdings such as Coca-Cola.\n\nApple's strong brand differentiates its products and services from competing offerings and allows it to charge premium prices. Buffett has said he believes the mark of a great business is the ability to raise prices -- Apple certainly fits that description.\n\nThis leads to the next trait Buffett appreciates, which is Apple's incredible financial profile. In fiscal 2015, the business reported an operating margin of 30% and generated $70 billion of free cash flow. Those strong profitability metrics prevail to this day, allowing Apple to repurchase much of its stock.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, when Buffett first started buying the stock, Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio averaged just 10.6. In hindsight, that was a wonderful bargain for such a dominant tech company.\n\nIs Apple a buy right now?\n\nApple's past performance is nothing short of spectacular. Even in 2023, shares soared 48%, crushing the S&P 500. However, investors must understand that past performance does not guarantee future results. Consequently, it's best not to assume Apple can keep rewarding shareholders the same way it has in the past. Instead, investors should view the stock with a fresh perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne thing is becoming strikingly clear: Apple's growth is slowing. Sales in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 2023) were down from the previous year, which is a rare occurrence. By depending heavily on the iPhone for its financial success, Apple is plateauing in a market where smartphone penetration already exceeds 85%. Many investors point to rising services revenue as the next big driver of the company's future growth, but hardware, especially the iPhone, will remain a pillar of the business for many years.\n\nSo how much are you willing to pay for shares in a company posting declining revenue? As of this writing, Apple shares trade for 30.3 times earnings, a premium valuation that's nearly triple what Buffett paid when he started his position -- all for a company with much less growth potential due to it being in a more mature stage of its lifecycle.\n\nApple is not offering the same bargain Buffett took advantage of in 2016, and investors should understand this reality before taking on a similarly overweight position in the stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Chinese shoppers don’t seem wowed by Apple’s newest iPhone, and that’s pushing the U.S. tech company to do something drastic: offer a rare discount.\n\nApple is discounting its latest iPhone by up to 500 yuan, or about $70, on its official website in China. The cut is roughly equal to 5% of the cost of an iPhone Pro Max 256GB model in mainland China. The three-day discount, which will run from Jan. 18 to 21, is marketed as a sale attached to the Lunar New Year, which falls in early February.\n\n“It’s no surprise to see Apple launching price discounts for its latest iPhone 15 series, especially since a similar promotion was seen early last year and it helped to stimulate some demand,” Will Wong, a senior research manager at market research firm IDC, says.\n\nIn January 2023, authorized retailers offered discounts of up to 800 yuan on the iPhone 14, then the top-of-the-line model. Those discounts came after a year-long slump in smartphone demand: Chinese shoppers bought 285.8 million smartphones in 2022, down 13.2% from the year before. It was the first time in a decade that smartphone shipments in China fell below 300 million, according to IDC.\n\nApple is facing stiff competition from Chinese competitors. The iPhone 15 underperformed in its first 17 days of sale compared to the iPhone 14, according to data from Counterpoint Research. The research firm’s latest report shows a continuous decline of Apple shipments since Q4 2022, with market share taken by local brands Huawei and Honor.\n\nRetailers on Chinese e-commerce platforms were discounting the iPhone 15 just a month after its release, ahead of China’s “Singles Day”, the Nov. 11 shopping festival.\n\n“Apple’s share is being challenged primarily by Huawei at the premium end of the market but also across the mid-high range in recent months from other Chinese competitors,” says Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. “These mid-to-high end devices are not just competitively priced, starting at around 3,999 RMB, but also boast features akin to those found in premium smartphones,” Lam adds.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps the most prominent iPhone competitor is the Huawei Mate 60, which features an advanced 7-nanometer processor and was highly celebrated by state media during its launch. The “buzz” around the Mate 60 brought challenges to Apple and the iPhone, Wong notes.\n\nApple’s net sales in China for its fiscal 2023, which ended Sept. 30, was down 2% from the year before. The U.S. and China were the only two countries that each accounted for more than 10% of Apple’s net sales in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\nApple is also offering discounts on other products during the Jan. 18-21 sale, including an 800 yuan ($112) discount on a MacBook Air.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Owns 6 Nasdaq-100 Stocks. Here's the Best One to Buy Right Now.",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 was sizzling hot in 2023, skyrocketing nearly 54%. It marked the best performance for the index since 1999.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) wasn't as hot. Sure, shares of the giant conglomerate jumped 15%. That wasn't enough to keep up with any of the major market indexes, though.\n\nBut Buffett's portfolio includes six Nasdaq-100 stocks. Here they are -- and which one is the best pick to buy right now. Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAll the Nasdaq-100 stocks Buffett owns\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ranks as the largest holding by far in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. It has also held the top position in the Nasdaq-100 for quite a while, although that could be in jeopardy with Microsoft's market cap gaining ground.\n\nBuffett's stake in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is much smaller. The e-commerce and cloud services leader is a biggie in the Nasdaq-100, though, with its weight in the index lagging behind only Apple and Microsoft.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio also includes another top 20 stock in the Nasdaq-100 -- T-Mobile US(NASDAQ: TMUS). The telecommunications company is a relatively small position for Buffett, with Berkshire's stake currently worth around $850 million.\n\nNext up is Charter Communications(NASDAQ: CHTR). The weight for this communications stock ranks it at No. 56 in the Nasdaq-100. Berkshire owns over 3.8 million shares of Charter worth roughly $1.4 billion.\n\nKraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) is the No. 60 stock in the Nasdaq-100 and has been a key holding for Buffett for years. Berkshire owns 26.5% of the food company. Kraft Heinz is even included on Berkshire's website's list of subsidiaries.\n\nLast -- and, in this case, least -- is Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). The satellite radio company barely made the Nasdaq-100. It's also a really small position in Berkshire's portfolio, with the conglomerate's stake in Sirius XM currently worth only around $50 million.\n\nA process of elimination\n\nWhich of these six Nasdaq-100 stocks that Buffett owns is the best pick? It depends on what your investment priorities are. If you're looking for income, Kraft Heinz offers the highest dividend yield. But most investors are interested in Nasdaq-100 stocks for growth, so let's focus on which stock is likely to deliver the most growth. We can use a process of elimination.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think we can immediately rule out Kraft Heinz. A consumer defensive stock usually won't generate inspiring growth.\n\nT-Mobile probably has some upside potential this year. However, the company continues to face significant competition in the wireless market. I wouldn't pick it as the most likely to succeed among these Buffett stocks.\n\nSirius XM has done a whole lot of nothing over the last five years. There are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the stock. Podcasting especially could be a growth driver. Still, I don't view Sirius XM as the stand-out winner among these Nasdaq-100 stocks.\n\nWhat about Charter Communications, which -- like T-Mobile -- provides wireless services? Wall Street thinks the stock could take off this year. The average 12-month price target is nearly 25% above Charter's current share price. I think the stock is possibly a contender, but cord-cutting could still weigh on the company's cable business.\n\nBuffett's favorite stock (other than Berkshire) is no doubt Apple. I wouldn't bet against Apple over the long run. However, its valuation is kind of steep right now with no rock-solid catalysts on the way. Sure, the company's new Vision Pro mixed-reality device could make a splash. With its hefty price tag, though, I wouldn't bank on it moving the needle all that much for Apple right out of the gate.\n\nBuffett's best Nasdaq-100 stock to buy right now\n\nThat leaves only one Nasdaq-100 stock in Buffett's portfolio -- Amazon. I think that Amazon is the best stock to buy now of the group. There are some good reasons why it was the best performer by far over the last 12 months among the six stocks.\n\nThe company's profitability has increased sharply (earnings more than tripled year over year in the latest reported quarter). I fully expect this trend to continue as a result of Amazon's renewed focus on its bottom line.\n\nAmazon continues to find new markets to enter. Healthcare, online car sales, and supply chain management services are three relatively recent examples. The company has also made a big push into advertising, which makes perfect sense.\n\nMost importantly, in my view, Amazon has a massive opportunity with the increased adoption of generative AI. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top cloud services provider based on market share. CEO Andy Jassy argued in the company's third-quarter conference call that customers want to run their AI models where their data is. I agree. That bodes well for AWS.\n\nThere are a handful of stocks that I think every investor should seriously consider owning. Amazon definitely makes that list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha, as he's come to be known, has overseen a nearly 4,500,000% aggregate gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A).\n\nBuffett's \"recipe\" for success is well documented. It includes buying stakes in profitable companies for the long-term, as well as focusing on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and trusted management teams.\n\nHowever, one of the \"ingredients\" to Berkshire Hathaway's success that doesn't receive enough credit is Buffett's love for dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend to their shareholders tend to be recurringly profitable, time-tested, and are capable of providing transparent long-term growth outlooks. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nMost importantly, income stocks have a lengthy track record of outperformance. A recent study from the Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past half century (1973-2022). This was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%) over the same timeline.\n\nIn 2024, Buffett's company is set to collect around $6 billion in dividend income (including preferred dividends).

Bank of America: $991,537,926 in annual dividend income\n\nAmong the nearly 50 stocks currently held in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio (not all of which pay dividends), Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) stands out as the top dog for Warren Buffett and his team when it comes to dividend income. The more than 1.03 billion shares of BofA stock held by Buffett's company will generate almost $992 million in annual income.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha and his team really appreciate cyclical businesses, and bank stocks certainly fit the mold. Even though recessions are a perfectly normal part of the economic cycle, they're relatively short-lived. Instead of trying to time when recessions will occur, Buffett has packed his company's portfolio with time-tested winners like Bank of America that he knows can benefit from long-winded periods of expansion.\n\nWhat's been particularly helpful for Bank of America of late is the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. Since March 2022, the Fed has increased its federal funds rate by 525 basis points. The steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades is music to the ears of BofA, which is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks. Higher interest rates have added billions of dollars in net interest income each quarter.\n\n2. Apple: $878,937,967 in annual dividend income\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding by a longshot -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for 47% of Berkshire's $361 billion portfolio, as of Jan. 9 -- is one of its top dividend stocks. Apple's $0.96-per-share payout translates into nearly $879 million in annual income for Buffett's company.\n\nDuring Berkshire's 2023 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett described Apple as \"a better business than any we own.\" This statement reflects Apple's exceptionally strong branding, highly loyal customer base, and its ability to out-innovate its competition. More than 15 years after its introduction, the iPhone still accounts for more than half of all smartphone market share in the U.S.\n\nHowever, Apple's innovation goes well beyond the physical products that made it famous (iPhone, Mac, and iPad). CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the ongoing evolution of Apple into a platforms' company. Focusing on subscription services should encourage consumers to stay within Apple's ecosystem of products and services, while also helping to soften the revenue fluctuations that are commonly observed during major iPhone replacement cycles. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price Chart\n\n3. Occidental Petroleum: $854,675,379 in annual dividend income (including preferred stock dividends)\n\nThe energy sector is often known for doling out robust dividends. Buffett is overseeing the collection of nearly $175.5 million in annual income from the 243.7 million shares of Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) common stock held, as well as $679.2 million from $8.49 billion in Occidental preferred stock that's yielding 8% on an annual basis.\n\nThe roughly $14 billion Warren Buffett and his team currently have invested in Occidental is a clear bet on the spot price for crude oil remaining elevated or moving higher. Even though Occidental is an integrated oil and gas company -- in addition to drilling, it operates chemical plants -- it generates the lion's share of its revenue from drilling. If the spot price of oil climbs, it'll enjoy an outsized benefit.\n\nOn the other hand, Occidental Petroleum's balance sheet is somewhat of an anomaly compared to most of Buffett's investments. This is to say that the Oracle of Omaha often avoids heavily indebted businesses. Despite Occidental slashing its net debt by nearly half since completing its acquisition of Anadarko, it's still lugging around $18.6 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30. It'll need the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated to further improve its financial flexibility. Image source: Coca-Cola.\n\n4. Coca-Cola: $736,000,000 in annual dividend income\n\nAnother foundational dividend stock in Warren Buffett's portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Based on Berkshire's ultralow cost basis of $3.2475 per share for Coca-Cola, the Oracle of Omaha's company is netting a 57% annual yield (Coca-Cola's base annual dividend is $1.84 per share), relative to cost.\n\nThe most-valuable thing Coca-Cola brings to the table for investors is predictability. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has ongoing operations in every other country. This leads to predictable operating cash flow in developed markets, and can provide the company with a steady organic growth boost from emerging markets. All told, Coca-Cola has more than two dozen brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nBranding and marketing are two identifiable keys to its success. According to Kantar's annual \"Brand Footprint\" report, Coke products have been chosen by consumers more than any other brand on the planet for 10 consecutive years (as of 2022). Aside from having a well-known brand, this is also a reflection of the company's top-tier marketing. Coke is utilizing digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to cater ads to younger audiences, while leaning on well-known brand ambassadors to remain connected with mature consumers.\n\n5. Chevron: $665,899,666 in annual dividend income\n\nHave I mentioned that energy stocks are known for potentially juicy dividends? Last year, Chevron(NYSE: CVX) increased its base annual payout for a 36th consecutive year, with its board also authorizing a share repurchase program of up to $75 billion. The more than 110 million shares of Chevron held by Berkshire entitle Buffett's company to almost $666 million in annual income.\n\nAlthough the investment thesis with Chevron somewhat mirrors Occidental Petroleum, there are two distinct differences between these integrated energy companies. To start with, Chevron generates a sizable percentage of its sales from its downstream segment, which includes chemical plants and refineries. Being less reliant on drilling for revenue means Chevron is better hedged than Occidental in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines.\n\nThe other big difference between these two integrated operators is their balance sheets. Whereas Occidental is quite levered, Chevron has a net debt ratio of just 8.1%, as of Sept. 30. Among the major global energy companies, an argument can be made that Chevron's balance sheet offers the most financial flexibility.\n\n6. Kraft Heinz: $521,015,709 in annual dividend income\n\nThe final Buffett stock that's generating more than $500 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway is packaged foods and condiments company Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC). Despite reducing its quarterly payout by 36% in 2019, Kraft Heinz is still doling out around $521 million each year to the Oracle of Omaha's company.\n\nThe beauty of consumer staples stocks like Kraft Heinz is that they provide a basic need good. Though consumers might reduce their discretionary spending during recessions, food isn't something people can live without. Further, Kraft Heinz's assortment of well-known brands affords the company exceptional pricing power.\n\nHowever, consumers are becoming more cost-conscious following a period of historically high inflation. Kraft Heinz has reported multiple quarters of declining volume/mix, which suggests consumers are trading down to cheaper store-branded goods as prices climb. Considering that the company has quite a bit of debt on its balance sheet, reigniting consumer interest in its brands could prove challenging.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

Notably, Microsoft's market value has risen by over $1 trillion.\n\nAnalysts are drawing parallels between this shift and the early 2000s, when technology and internet companies began to replace consumer and financial firms at the forefront of the market's highest echelons.\n\nAccording to LSEG data, Microsoft's market cap stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, while Apple's market cap was $2.875 trillion as of Friday's close after peaking at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14.\n\nMicrosoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google's dominance of web search.\n\nApple, on the other hand, is facing challenges with waning demand, including for its flagship product, the iPhone.\n\nThe company is particularly struggling in China, a key market where economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been sluggish and competition from a resurgent Huawei is intensifying, impacting its market share.\n\nOther AI-focused tech players such as Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet, also witnessed a big jump in their market cap in the past year.\n\n(Reporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru; Editing by Varun H K)",

        "title": "3 Super Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in January",
        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio is a great source to find outstanding businesses that have won the approval of one brilliant investor.\n\nSince 1965, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has delivered a phenomenal return of 3,787,464% through 2022. It's an extraordinary record of growth that resulted from a combination of two things: Buffett's purchases of businesses outright and purchases of small pieces of quality companies through the stock market.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Berkshire's combined investment in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY), and Mastercard(NYSE: MA) had a grand total of nearly $173 billion, with Apple making up most of that. Here's why any one of these top stocks would be great places to park some cash to start the new year.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple is Berkshire's largest holding, worth $156 billion at the end of the third quarter. Berkshire last added to its Apple stake in the first quarter of 2023, but the stock is up only 12% since the end of March, so it's not far above where Buffett himself or one of his investing deputies might have been buying more shares.\n\nBuffett has long been an advocate of buying companies with a clear competitive advantage over rivals. He also places a high value on companies that generate profits that can be reinvested in the business at high rates of return. Apple certainly passes the latter test, earning an extraordinary return on invested capital of 56%.\n\nBuffett admires Apple's ability to make products that people can't live without. It has won over millions of loyal customers, if not billions, with the installed base of devices doubling over the last seven years to 2 billion.\n\nCustomers who spend thousands of dollars on Apple's products are then spending more on apps, subscriptions, iCloud storage plans, AppleCare warranties, and other services, which generate much higher margins than iPhones. Services revenue has been the company's fastest-growing business in recent years, and this is contributing to a growing mountain of cash to distribute to shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple generated $99 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the last year, and it distributed about 15% of that to shareholders in quarterly dividend payments, with $77 billion going toward share buybacks. Buffett loves companies that generate lots of FCF and then use that cash to buy back shares. This reduces a company's total shares outstanding, and therefore increases Berkshire's percentage of ownership in the company.\n\nApple's brand, high margins, and high return on invested capital are great reasons to buy shares this month. Look for these qualities to lift the stock to new highs over the next few years and beyond.\n\n2. Occidental Petroleum\n\nBuffett's Berkshire has been building a large stake in top oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum over the last few years. The company bought more shares in December, bringing Berkshire's percentage ownership in the company to 34%.\n\nAs an energy company that derives most of its revenue from drilling, Occidental has financial results that can swing with the price of oil. The spot price in the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has fallen 8% over the last year, which has weighed on the stock price lately.\n\nBut Berkshire clearly likes the direction in which Occidental is moving. Occidental generated $6.9 billion in FCF over the last four quarters, despite lower oil prices. That is nearly three times what it produced five years ago.\n\nFree cash flow has fallen over the last year with oil prices, but Occidental's management is making moves to keep growing FCF. In December, Occidental announced an agreement to acquire oil and gas producer Crownrock for $12 billion. While the acquisition will add to Occidental's debt burden (it ended the third quarter with $19 billion of net debt), Crownrock will also immediately benefit the company's FCF, which will prove valuable if oil prices slip.\n\nOccidental has been using excess cash flow to pay down debt, buy back shares, and pay dividends -- all shareholder-friendly moves. The stock currently pays a dividend yield of 1.25% and trades at a cheap 8 times trailing FCF, which makes it clear why Berkshire was recently buying shares.\n\n3. Mastercard\n\nMastercard stock has been a phenomenal investment for Berkshire, which held over $1.5 billion worth of the credit card brand's shares at the end of September. The stock has climbed 119% since 2019 and has a lot more upside over the long term.\n\nMore use of digital payment services has been a boon for leading credit card brands. It has driven more opportunities for a brand like Mastercard to become just a tap away for online and in-store payments. The company has a massive reach with 3.3 billion cards outstanding worldwide, driving over 37 billion transactions in the third quarter alone.\n\nThe growth of digital payments over the last decade helped drive consistent double-digit increases in revenue and earnings. Mastercard is still going strong with revenue up 11% year over year on a currency-neutral basis in the third quarter.\n\nOne explanation for Mastercard's strong growth is that it doesn't have the risks of traditional financial institutions. It doesn't issue cards to consumers or carry any credit risk on its balance sheet.\n\nInstead, it operates as a payments processor, and this business model translates to very high margins and a formidable competitive moat, since it would be too expensive to duplicate a global payment network that handles billions of transactions.\n\nThe business has grown FCF by 14% per year over the last decade. That growth has led to consistent increases in the dividend and share buybacks. In fact, Mastercard has returned all FCF to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in recent years.\n\nMastercard still sees a lot of opportunities to expand acceptance of digital payments around the world, which could spell several more years of strong earnings and FCF growth. The stock returned over 400% cumulatively to shareholders over the last decade, and the next 10 years could see a similar result.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Following a great 2023 for Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, which soared 48% higher, the stock is taking a breather so far in 2024. Year to date, shares are down more than 3%. Is this an opportunity to buy shares of the iPhone maker, or is the stock's decline justified?\n\nTo explore whether or not shares are attractive today, let's look at both the bear and bull cases for the tech stock.\n\nBear case\n\nThe bear case for Apple (the case against owning the stock) can be summarized in two points:\n\nThe tech company has struggled to grow revenue recently and its stock's valuation has become borderline frothy. This has some investors worried that the company may not meet the high expectations currently baked into the stock price.\n\nRegarding the Cupertino-based company's growth, fiscal 2023 revenue fell nearly 3% year over year. Further, earnings per share barely budged, coming in at $6.13 for the period -- up from $6.11 in the year-ago quarter. A pullback in iPhone sales and a dramatic decline in Mac sales weighed on the year's results. Foreign exchange headwinds were also a major factor pulling down revenue and earnings.\n\nAlso raising some eyebrows is the stock's valuation. Over the last year, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio has gone from 22 to more than 30. Viewed another way, the company has a $2.9 trillion market capitalization despite annual earnings only coming in at $97 billion.\n\nThis high valuation bakes in robust earnings-per-share growth for years to come. More specifically, a valuation at this level demands average annual earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digits over the next decade and, more importantly, continued market dominance in lucrative segments like its iPhone and services businesses.\n\nBull case\n\nBut don't count Apple out. The bull case (the case for owning the stock) highlights several reasons the company could deliver strong earnings growth in the coming years.\n\nFirst, there's Apple's fast-growing services segment. This segment, which includes revenue from services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, AppleCare, and revenue share from third-party applications in the App Store, grew 16% year over year in Apple's most recent fiscal quarter. Further, management said the company expects similar growth, when adjusted to exclude revenue from the extra week in the year-ago period, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nLonger term, there's good reason to expect Apple's momentum in services to persist. The tailwinds for the segment are numerous, including a nascent but meaningful advertising business, Apple's ability to bring new services to market over time, and rapid growth in third-party app subscriptions.\n\nAnother reason to be bullish on Apple stock is its strong balance sheet combined with management's excellent track record of good capital allocation. The company ended fiscal Q4 with a net cash and marketable securities position of $51 billion. With a goal to become cash neutral (the point at which total cash and marketable securities equals total debt) over time, Apple has been steadily repurchasing its shares and paying dividends. Further, Apple has a history of opportunistically buying back more stock when shares appear cheaper. This prudent approach to repurchases makes every dollar go further than if the company purchased the same amount of shares every quarter no matter where the stock traded.\n\nOf course, with annual free cash flow of nearly $100 billion, it's going to take some time for Apple to become net cash neutral. So, investors can expect the company to repurchase shares in substantial sums and pay meaningful dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\nCombining these positive developments (a fast-growing services segment and prudent capital allocation backed by a healthy balance sheet) with the company's loyal customer base and Apple's long history of innovation, the tech stock arguably deserves to trade at a premium valuation. While it may not make sense to be an aggressive buyer of Apple stock at this valuation, it may make sense for investors without exposure to the stock to start a small position following its recent dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Biggest Bets: 56.6% of Berkshire Hathaway's $359 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 2 Passive-Income-Generating Blue Chip Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "Instead of paying cash directly to shareholders in the form of dividends, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has preferred to buy back his company's stock and invest in other businesses. But there can be no doubt that the Oracle of Omaha loves dividends.\n\nEach of the 10 largest holdings in the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio pays a dividend, and the company's largest stock positions generate an impressive amount of passive income each year. Over the next year, Buffett's company is expected to receive more than $6 billion in dividend payments just for sitting on its current stock holdings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two of Berkshire's largest stock investments -- dividend-paying, blue-chip companies that account for roughly 56.6% of the holding company's portfolio. Based on current investments these two stocks will likely serve up approximately $1.9 billion in payments to Berkshire over the next year.\n\n1. Apple\n\nAs of its last filing, Berkshire owned roughly 915.6 million shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. Valued at roughly $168.8 billion, the stock holdings account for roughly 47% of Berkshire's total public stock portfolio.\n\nApple has boosted its payout by roughly 120% over the last decade, but its stock gains of more than 907% across the stretch have far outstripped its dividend hikes. As a result, the company's dividend yield has been pushed down despite the solid payout growth and shares currently sport a yield of roughly 0.5%.\n\nDespite the stock offering a relatively small yield for today's prices, Berkshire's massive investment stake means that its holdings in Apple are one of its biggest passive income generators.\n\nWith Apple's stock currently paying an annual forward distribution of $0.96 per share, Berkshire is on track to generate roughly $879 million in dividend income from its position over the next year. Given that the tech giant will most likely deliver another payout increase this year, there's a good chance that Buffett's company will see dividend payments at least slightly above that level.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Bank of America\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC) stands as Berkshire's second-largest stock position, trailing behind only Apple in terms of overall portfolio weight. As of its most recent filing, Buffett's company owned more than 1.03 billion shares of the bank's stock -- a position valued at roughly $34.5 billion. Berkshire's BofA holdings account for roughly 9.6% of its total stock portfolio.\n\nToday, Bank of America's stock boasts a solid yield of 2.9% -- but Buffett's company is getting a much better yield on its position. After initially closing out its position in BofA at the end of 2010, Berkshire made a deal to invest in the company again. The move wound up being one of the Oracle of Omaha's best-ever plays.\n\nWhen Bank of America was facing macroeconomic pressures and potential liquidity issues in 2011, Buffett approached the company's CEO with a financial lifeline. Berkshire wound up buying $5 billion worth of the company's preferred shares. Berkshire also secured stock warrants that would give it the right to purchase 700 million shares of the bank's common stock at a price of $7.14 per share.\n\nIn June 2017, Buffett's company cashed in those warrants. At the time, Bank of America stock was trading at $24.32 per share. Berkshire scored paper gains of roughly 240% with the move. But the long-term impact of this incredible investment has been even more significant. BAC Chart\n\nNot only has Bank of America stock continued to climb since Buffett moved to exercise the stock warrants, but the financial giant has also delivered big hikes for its dividend.\n\nWith its current annual dividend of $0.96 per share, Berkshire is enjoying an annual yield of 13.4% on the 700 million shares it bought at $7.14 per share in the stock warrant deal. That's an astounding yield to be banking on an investment in a company as solid as present-day BofA.\n\nBuffett's company is on track to receive roughly $990 million in dividend income from its Bank of America holdings over the next year. Given the likelihood that the bank will once again raise its payout this year, Berkshire's haul should be even higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Apple Next?",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has split its stock five times since its IPO in 1980. It executed three 2-for-1 splits in 1987, 2000, and 2005, a 7-for-1 split in 2014, and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Those splits would have turned 100 shares bought prior to the first one into 22,400 shares -- and anyone who bought 100 shares at its IPO price of $22 and held on would have seen their initial $2,200 investment turn into a holding worth more than $4.2 million today.\n\nNow, those stock splits didn't actually make Apple's shares more valuable. They simply carved its existing shares into smaller ownership slices of the company, which reduced their prices and made them easier to trade on the options market where a single contract needs to be tethered to 100 shares. The underlying valuation of the company, and of investors' positions in it, remained the same. Image source: Apple.\n\nMost brokerages now make it easy for retail investors to buy and sell fractional shares, so they won't be prevented from putting money into a company because it has too high a share price and stock splits don't matter as much as they used to. That said, stock splits still usually generate a lot of media buzz and attract the attention of retail investors who might be more inclined to purchase shares of a stock with a double-digit price tag instead of a triple-digit one.\n\nSo could Apple split its stock, which currently trades at around $186 per share, in the near future?\n\nIt could be years before Apple's next stock split\n\nWhen Apple announced its last 4-for-1 split on July 30, 2020, its stock was trading at $385. When it announced its previous 7-for-1 split on April 23, 2014, it was trading at $525.\n\nBased on those two decisions, it doesn't seem likely that Apple will choose to split its stock at its current level of around $200 a share. It has also been just three and a half years since its last split, and the shortest period between its stock splits has been nearly five years (2000 to 2005) so far. Therefore, it will probably be at least a few more years before Apple's board approves another stock split.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has lots of near-term challenges\n\nApple is already worth almost $2.9 trillion, which makes it one of the two most valuable companies in the world alongside Microsoft. (Microsoft briefly moved ahead of Apple to take the No. 1 spot on Thursday.)  It could be difficult for Apple to grow its market cap meaningfully from there as its revenue growth and earnings growth cool off.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only rise 4% and 8%, respectively, in its fiscal 2024 (which will end in September) as iPhone sales slow down. Its iPhone sales fell 2% in fiscal 2023 -- due to the end of the 5G upgrade cycle and macroeconomic challenges in China -- but the flagship smartphone still accounted for over half of the company's total revenue.\n\nDeclining sales of Macs in the post-pandemic market and currency headwinds exacerbated that slowdown. Apple is trying to offset that pressure by expanding its services ecosystem, which now features more than a billion paid subscriptions, but it remains overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone. A patent dispute also recently disrupted the sales of Apple Watches in the U.S., and the $3,500 price tag of the new Vision Pro headset will limit its mainstream appeal when it launches in early February.\n\nConsidering all the challenges Apple faces, its stock doesn't look like a bargain at 28 times forward earnings. And its paltry dividend yield of 0.5% won't attract any serious income investors at a time when CDs and Treasuries offer risk-free yields of more than 5%.\n\nInvestors should focus on Apple's cash flow and buybacks\n\nInstead of wondering when Apple might split its stock again, investors should focus on the company's cash flows and buybacks as it navigates the near-term headwinds. It generated $99.6 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the past 12 months, and it spent $77.6 billion of that total on buybacks and $15 billion on dividends. It bought back 38% of its outstanding shares over the past 10 years, and it has raised its dividend every year since it reinstated the payout in 2012.\n\nThose moves indicate Apple is a shareholder-friendly company that would rather return its excess cash to its investors instead of \"di-worsifying\" itself with reckless investments or acquisitions. That might be why Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has allocated nearly half of its stock portfolio to Apple.\n\nBut with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities on its books at the end of its latest quarter, Apple still has plenty of room to make big acquisitions to expand its ecosystem. That cash cushion also makes it a good safe haven stock to own during economic downturns.\n\nApple's upside might be limited this year, but its core strengths should limit its downside potential until its next growth cycle starts. Therefore, it might still be a good time to accumulate this stock as the bears bemoan its lack of near-term catalysts.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "If PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) were valued like Visa (NYSE:V), PayPal stock would rise. This could have important implications for PYPL stock investors.\n\nThe world’s biggest payment processor is now America’s most valuable bank. Its shares are up almost 20% over the last year and are now priced at 32 times earnings. PayPal, meanwhile, is down over 20% in the last year and sells at 18 times earnings.\n\nBut PayPal isn’t Visa. One reason is its big bet on crypto.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Crypto Bet\n\nPaypal runs a crypto stablecoin called PYUSD (PYUSD-USD). Stablecoins are seen as a bridge between the world of fiat currencies, like the dollar, and crypto coins, like Bitcoin (BTC-USD). If you buy something with Bitcoin, PayPal will sell your PYUSD to make the transaction work. PayPal also enables the sending of PYUSD within the U.S. without fees.\n\nThe first step in making it work for PayPal is for PYUSD to be accepted in the crypto community. PayPal is doing this with “incentives” on Curve Finance and getting it accepted at sites trading Ethereum (ETH-USD), like AAVE.\n\nThe “use case” is that PYUSD will be borrowed or lent on the platforms. Lending through a stablecoin means holding it. PayPal has $291 million in PYUSD circulating, which trades just like any cryptocurrency.\n\nEvaluating the Bet\n\nMaking this bet pay off requires that consumers start using PYUSD, and thus other forms of crypto, the same way they do dollars. It’s the transaction volume moving through PYUSD and the money made by PayPal through those transactions that matter.\n\nAll the excitement over Bitcoin’s rising price and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs play into this. The idea is that people will buy Bitcoin, see its value rise, and then use that value through PYUSD on goods and services. That’s the use case.\n\nPart of building the case is to integrate PYUSD into PayPal’s other operations, like Venmo. But until people start moving around real markets using PYUSD, it’s a risk that normal processors don’t have.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo Thanks\n\nPYPL stock does a lot of business that critics don’t trust.\n\nIt’s huge in the casino business, for instance. That’s why the stock remains “a bargain.” It’s also why some long-time holders are bailing.\n\nEven analysts who like CEO Alex Chriss have downgraded the stock recently, believing he faces a multi-year turnaround. They note that the core branded checkout business is getting hammered by the Cloud Czars, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG), who are pushing both consumers and merchants toward their wallets.\n\nAmong the recent bears is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), based on the slow growth at Venmo and its branded checkout solution. But even Morgan Stanley now rates PayPal an “equal weight” holding. They’re not telling people to sell it.\n\nAnalysts like Mizuho’s Dan Dolev are filled with advice on what Chriss should do. Prominent is the idea that PayPal should integrate all its offerings into a “super app,” a global digital wallet that handles any form of exchange and any currency, including crypto.\n\nDoes that sound familiar? It’s just what Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is doing with X, and what Musk tried to do while at PayPal back in the 1990s.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIf you believe in crypto, PayPal should be one of your core stock holdings. It’s cheap, and if PYUSD takes off, the stock is a value investor’s dream.\n\nI remain skeptical. Maybe it’s because I just turned 69. Even on PayPal’s site describing PYUSD, there’s nothing it can do that doesn’t depend, ultimately, on crypto. The costs of trading crypto directly remain dramatic. The value of crypto is held up entirely by traders. PYUSD itself is a workaround, backed by dollars, not by Bitcoin.\n\nI’d rather hold Visa or another payment processor like Fiserv (NYSE:FI).\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in AAPL and GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is shutting a 121-person team related to artificial intelligence operations in San Diego, leaving many employees at risk of termination, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTaiwan Elects US-Friendly President, Defying China Warnings Biden Says US Doesn’t Support Taiwan Independence After Vote Iran Wins With US Airstrikes on Houthis in Yemen Bill Ackman Is Bringing Activist Playbook to America’s Culture Wars Trump Judge Says He’ll Hold Hearing on Fani Willis Affair Claims\n\nThe group, known as Data Operations Annotations, was told Wednesday that they would be relocating to Austin to merge with the Texas portion of the same team, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven’t been announced.\n\nApple told employees that they have until the end of February to decide if they will relocate, according to the people. If they don’t, the workers will be terminated on April 26.\n\nThe group, which also has offices in China, India, Ireland and Spain, is responsible for improving Siri by listening to queries to the voice service and determining if it heard and handled questions accurately. The announcement to close the San Diego group was made by Christine DeFilippo, a top deputy to Apple AI chief John Giannandrea, the people said.\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman confirmed the relocation decision, saying the company is bringing its “Data Operations Annotations teams in the US together at our campus in Austin, where a majority of the team is already based.” She added that “everyone currently employed will have the opportunity to continue their role with Apple in Austin.”\n\nThe company also said it’s “deeply committed to San Diego,” where it has “grown significantly,” and that it is continuing to hire as Apple expands its engineering teams. In other countries where the affected team operates, Apple keeps all the employees in one office.\n\nFor the San Diego staff, the move came as a surprise. The AI team had been working from an office that Apple is renting, according to the people. But the company had told staff recently that they would be relocated to a new Apple campus in the area at the end of January. Earlier this month, Apple distributed packing boxes to employees to prepare for a relocation within the city.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, they’ll now have to move to Texas. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the majority of affected workers have indicated that they’re unwilling to relocate to Austin. Apple told employees that they could apply for other jobs, but some don’t think they’ll be eligible for many roles because they don’t have engineering backgrounds, the people said.\n\nThe San Diego employees focused on Siri use in Hebrew, English, multiple dialects of Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and French.\n\nThe move has the potential to result in several dozen workers leaving the company. Apple, which had 161,000 employees as of September, has mostly managed to avoid layoffs since the pandemic — in contrast with most of its tech peers. It did, however, cut some corporate retail jobs last April, as well as recruiters.\n\nEmployees who are willing to relocate to Austin by the end of June will be able keep their roles, Apple said. The company is offering $7,000 relocation stipends. Those who choose to leave Apple will see their roles eliminated and get four weeks of severance — plus an additional week for every year worked. They’ll also get six months of health insurance.\n\nThe team has a notable history within Apple. Years ago, the group was mostly made up of contractors who listened to Siri queries to ensure their accuracy. That practice raised privacy concerns and was made optional for customers in 2019. The contractors ended up being fired and replaced with full-time employees.\n\nA small number of employees in the group have begun assisting Apple with a move to AI products based on large language models, or LLMs. These employees are now reviewing potential queries to Siri and choosing among a handful of answers. They then have to explain their decision. Apple is planning to announce its LLM plans in June, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top Priority Trumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election Kim Kardashian’s Skims Isn’t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch Five ETFs to Watch in 2024 US Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China’s War Machine\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and Top 11 Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and His Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nJim Cramer kicked off 2024 with an observation that the market might be undergoing a rotation where investors are taking profits from major mega-cap tech stocks and pouring these profits into the laggards of 2023 like banks, healthcare and consumer companies.\n\nWhat Jim Cramer's 'Crystal Ball' Says About 2024\n\nJim Cramer said that according to his \"crystal ball,\" investors this year would take profits selling \"best of the best\" and invest in companies that \"haven’t gotten respect for ages.\" By best of the best Cramer meant the Magnificent Seven group of stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  and \"richly valued\" software companies.\n\nCramer talked about his early days in the Wall Street where the beginning of every new year would bring excitement and enthusiasm among investors that caused \"repositioning\" in the market. Cramer said that most of the times this repositioning is temporary and does not have a lot of importance in the long run. Cramer said that some circles believe the Magnificent Seven group of stocks won't be able to sustain their rally. Cramer said he reluctantly agrees with this notion but long-term investors should approach these sell-offs as buying opportunities.\n\n\"A Heck With These Traders\"\n\nCramer predicted that 2024 markets would be defined by what the Fed does about inflation as traders will keep looking over their shoulder for the next inflation report and Jerome Powell's comments. But Cramer advised his viewers to \"don’t be one of those people,\" referring to investors who impulsively react to any \"utterances\" from the Fed, traders, economists or politicians about the stock market.\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer expressed his frustration with this short-term, reactive investing approach and said:\n\n\"Me? I say a heck with these traders.\"\n\nCramer Says AI and Software Bubbles Will be Popped\n\nJim Cramer said during beginning of every new year investors usually sell stocks that perform extremely well in the previous year and invest their money into beaten down stocks. But that trend changes after earnings season begins and investors come back to top performers of the previous year. Jim Cramer predicted that the artificial intelligence and enterprises software \"bubbles will be popped.\" But once these stocks come back to reasonable valuations compared to other stocks they will once again be bought, Cramer thinks.\n\nJim Cramer went through different sectors to weigh options for investors. For the healthcare sector, Cramer said \"no thank you\" since he believes healthcare stocks do not perform well during election years. For retail, Cramer said these companies are \"finally getting their arms around the shoplifting problem\" and could produce better returns. For the oil industry, Cramer said \"very difficult\" since \"we produce so much crude in this country\" that it's hard for oil prices to go higher.\n\nWait for the Sell-Off and Then Do \"Some Buying\"\n\nJim Cramer said he told his investing club members that they'll be \"rewarded\" if they bought stocks with decent valuations, not dramatically expensive when compared to average S&P 500 multiples. Cramer said investors should be patient and wait for the sell-off he's expecting and then do \"some buying.\" Jim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and Top 10 Stock Picks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC during early January and picked 11 stocks he's bullish on.\n\n11. Symbotic Inc (NASDAQ:SYM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nTalking about robotics warehouse automation company Symbotic Inc (NASDAQ:SYM), Jim Cramer recently said during his program that he likes \"real AI\" that helps companies make money and not the AI that is just for press releases.

In December,  Laura Jean Flanaga, a director at Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp (NYSE:MODG), bought 2,000 company shares at $12.62.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Small Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (NYSE:MODG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Slipping by -30% were the shares of Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (NYSE:MODG), which manufactures golf equipment and accessories, as well as operates entertainment venues. Revenues were shy of expectations because recent wildfires in Canada led to temporary closures of Topgolf locations there. However, the company’s equipment sales showed larger-than-expected volumes and recent golf industry data indicated higher activity levels.”\n\n8. Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nAnswering a question about Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM), Jim Cramer recently said that Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) CEO Rene Haas is doing a \"fantastic job.\" Cramer said some circles have sounded skepticism around the stock amid weakness  in cell phone and PC business.\n\nCramer said that this company is doing \"so much so right, they are going to dominate cell phone, PC, hyperscale.\"\n\nCramer said he'd want to buy Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) for his charitable trust.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) doing this period was\n\n7. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nEarlier this month, Jim Cramer called GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) a \"ridiculously cheap\" stock. Cramer said GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) is doing \"so many great things.\" The analyst also said that when the stock was at $66 \"a guy\" downgraded the stock but Cramer said he'd recommended \"Buy, Buy, Buy\" on the stock.\n\nCramer also said that his Charitable Trust has a \"big position\" in the stock and he's sticking with the GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) stock for the \"long haul.\"\n\nA total of 41 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC).\n\nSound Shore Management made the following comment about GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“That said, current macro factors of higher inflation, rising rates, and a slowing economy are affecting stock prices in the short-term. Against this backdrop, many consumer stocks and financing-based business models declined in the third quarter. For example, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) was our largest detractor for the period. A recent spinout from GE, the company is the world’s largest medical imaging supplier with steady growth and higher margins. We purchased the stock in the first quarter of 2023 when it was trading at 14 times normalized earnings, a significant discount to peers. Our research concluded that GEHC’s profit margins were temporarily depressed due to the spinoff and one-time Research & Development charges, and that management’s plan for improvement was credible. The stock got off to a strong start early in the year, but returned the bulk of its gains as higher borrowing rates for their customers created demand uncertainty. As well, 15% of GE Healthcare’s business is from China, where demand has slowed along with the economy. We view these headwinds as temporary, and added to our position during the stock’s recent pullback.”\n\n6. Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nJim Cramer was excited about aerospace-related engineering services company Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) recently.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). Until now.\n\nThe Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apple’s closely guarded ecosystem. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.\n\n\"You don't ramp up unless you find that there's something significant there that you want to investigate,\" adjunct Columbia University Law School professor Martin Edel said about the reported probe. The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.\n\nStill, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.\n\nThreatening the 'walled garden'\n\nApple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.\n\nApple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.\n\nBut the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.\n\nStory continues\n\nA DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.\n\nBut Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nEdel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position. The iPhone 15 Pro is presented during the \"Wonderlust\" event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. (Loren Elliott/REUTERS/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nApple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to reign in Big Tech.\n\n\"The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,\" Edel said.\n\nUniversity of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.\n\nFor one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.\n\n\"If I were Apple, I’d be pretty worried about this,\" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the world’s top antitrust litigators in-house. The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after its unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCritics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.\n\nThe company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.\n\nInteroperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.\n\nThe Epic effect\n\nThere are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.\n\nOne is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.\n\nIn that case, the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.\n\nHowever, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.\n\nApple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which has yet to say whether it will hear the case. What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit, Newman said, would depend on where the department chose to file its case. \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games' chief executive Tim Sweeney leaves after a weekslong antitrust trial at federal court in Oakland, Calif, in 2021. (Brittany Hosea-Small/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\"They could take the fight to Apple’s doorstep, but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case,\" Newman said. \"DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.\"\n\nGoogle's battle\n\nThe second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.\n\nClosing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.\n\nThe lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.\n\nIf the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.\n\nThose talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Former Vice President Al Gore is retiring from Apple’s board after 21 years. Matthias Nareyek/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore is set to leave Apple’s board in February after serving as a director for more than two decades, the tech giant announced in an SEC filing yesterday (Jan. 11). Also stepping down from the board is James Bell, the former chief financial officer at Boeing. They will be replaced by former Aerospace CEO Wanda Austin, pending a shareholder vote at Apple (AAPL)’s annual shareholder meeting next month, according to the filing.\n\nGore and Bell both turned 75 last year, making them too old to be reelected as board members under Apple’s policy.\n\n“For more than 20 years, Al has contributed an incredible amount to our work—from his unconditional support for protecting our users’ privacy, to his incomparable knowledge of environment and climate issues,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. “James’s dedication has been extraordinary, and we’re thankful for the important perspectives and deep expertise he’s offered on audit, finance, and so much more over the years.”\n\nGore and Bell both earned about $380,000 in cash and stock awards last year as Apple’s board directors, according to the SEC filing. Over his 21 years with the company, Gore has amassed Apple shares worth more than $87 million. Bell, who has been a board member since 2015, owns Apple stock worth more than $7 million, the filing revealed.\n\nTheir replacement, Austin, is 69. She was the president and CEO of Aerospace Corporation from 2008 through 2016. She was the first woman and African American person to run the company.\n\n“Like Apple, I’ve always believed in the power of innovation to improve lives, support human potential, and shape a better future,” Austin said in a statement. “I’m honored to join Apple’s board of directors, and I look forward to being part of a company that’s always creating new ways to empower people all over the world.”\n\n“She’s an extraordinary leader, and her invaluable experience and expertise will support our mission of leaving the world better than we found it,” Cook said in his statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Austin gets elected at next month’s shareholders meeting, Apple’s board will consist of eight directors:\n\nAuthur Levinson, founder and CEO of Calico Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Alex Gorsky, former chair of Johnson & Johnson Susan Wagner, cofounder and director of BlackRock Andrea Jung, president and CEO of Grameen America Monica Lozano, former president and CEO of College Futures Foundation Ronald Sugar, former chair and CEO of Northrop Grumman Corporation Wanda Austin, former president and CEO of Aerospace Corporation\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nEmma Watson's Best Style Moments The Best Red Carpet Fashion at the 2024 Golden Globes These Are the Winners of the 81st Golden Globe Awards 'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning 81st Golden Globes: The Biggest Winners, Surprise Snubs, and Takeaways\n\nRead the original story Al Gore and Ex-Boeing CFO Are Leaving Apple's Board: Here's Who Are Left and others by Nhari Djan at Observer.",

        "title": "Microsoft edges out Apple as world's most valuable company",
        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Microsoft's stock market value ended a trading session higher than Apple's for the first time since 2021 on Friday, making it the world's most valuable company as worries about demand hit the iPhone maker's shares.\n\nApple crept up 0.2% on Friday, while Microsoft added 1%. With that, Microsoft's market capitalization stood at $2.887 trillion, its highest ever, according to LSEG data. Apple's market capitalization was $2.875 trillion, calculated with data in a filing on Thursday.\n\nWorries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down 3% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 3% year to date after surging 57% in 2023 in a rally driven in part by its lead in generative artificial intelligence through an investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nApple's market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, according to LSEG.\n\nMicrosoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter. Its AI lead has also created an opportunity to challenge Google's dominance of web search.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has been grappling with tepid demand, including for the iPhone, its cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a resurgent Huawei erodes its market share.\n\nSales of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple's biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report this week estimated that Vision Pro sales would be \"relatively immaterial\" to Apple's earnings per share in 2024.\n\nA handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 32 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report in November, Apple gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand for iPads and wearables.\n\nAnalysts on average see Apple posting revenue up 0.7% to $117.9 billion for the December quarter, according to LSEG. That would mark its first year-on-year revenue increase in four quarters. Apple reports its results on Feb. 1.\n\nAnalysts see Microsoft reporting a 16% increase in revenue to $61.1 billion, lifted by ongoing growth in its cloud business when it reports in the coming weeks.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; Editing by Will Dunham)",

        "title": "Apple &amp; Microsoft: The future of AI in consumer tech",
        "content": "Investors paid careful attention to Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) at CES 2024 (Consumer Electronics Show) as, for a brief moment, Microsoft took over as the most valuable company for the first time since 2021. Microsoft has made a lot of ground for investment and development of AI, from purchasing OpenAI to the buzz around ChatGPT, while Apple has been grappling with weaker iPhone demand, especially in China.\n\nConstellation Research Founder and Principal Analyst R \"Ray\" Wang joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Apple's AI strategy and share some of the latest tech innovations seen at CES.\n\n\"What we've seen over the last couple of quarters is declining revenues but profits are still increasing. That's because the services equation of the rational is actually growing in services a lot more profitable than putting out a piece of hardware,\" Wang says about Apple. \"I would say that we've probably seen those same kind of trends. But we do supplier checks, and suppliers aren't that nervous, in the sense that they're saying... we're going to see a decrease, mostly because we are in a super cycle.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: It's interesting, Ray, because, obviously, investors very excited about AI. That was a huge theme in 2023 and that excitement obviously helped really supercharge Microsoft stock, right? I mean, really can see like the investment Nadella makes in Microsoft versus how that stock-- what a great deal. I guess the question for Apple though, is what is their AI story? You'll hear rumors of this and whispers of this, but what do you think is coming there?\n\nRAY WANG: Well, the interesting thing is Apple has never explicitly had said they have an AI strategy, but we've all experienced what an ambient experience looks like, right? Take a photo, the lighting is off. Suddenly, it looks better. I mean, we've done with gray sky pictures, every picture now looks blue, right? It's kind of crazy like that.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd so their AI is embedded in the background. They have a lot of it already. It's starting from the chip level all the way down to the user experience. I think they just have to tell the story more if they want to tell that AI story.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: You don't think they're going to put time, and effort, and money into building out those capabilities? Maybe would you not expect maybe a bit, some big announcement coming at the big software show in June?\n\nRAY WANG: I'm not sure they're going to have a Samsung, the whole world is Galaxy AI kind of strategy that was announced at CES. I think it's been here all the time. And I think people are going to see what it means to actually have AI that works versus, hey, we're talking about AI.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Ray, we were talking over the brink-- over the break and you mentioned that the CES has become an auto show, a car show. Lots to do in mobility and the advances for AI, of course, it's integrated in every facet, you've got to think. But how does this roll out to the public? How does AI become, I guess, more a part of everyday internet of things objects as those become embedded in our lives?\n\nRAY WANG: Yeah, so we're seeing across a couple of fronts. You saw it in energy management. You saw it in the ability to help you as an assistant, help anything from translation to be able to manage your day-to-day activities. We see it in smart lighting and smart buildings. They're actually adjusted to your needs.\n\nWe're seeing it in the health arena as people are quantifying their self and saying, oh, yeah, is that a heart murmur or is that not a heart murmur? Wait, am I allergic to this thing? Right, so we're starting to see that as augmenting humanity. Over time what we may get to a point, and that's probably 10 to 15 years out, is there will be more situational awareness.\n\nSo right now it's augmenting humanity. In the future, it's how do we train the machines to get to the level of precision I want to get to. And then at some point, we're going to get to that full automation that we all are dreaming of. And remember, the automation is the only other way you want it, not the way someone else does.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: The way I'm dreaming of it, right? Yes.\n\nRAY WANG: Yes, the way all we're dreaming it.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And Ray, I want to bring it back to Apple real quickly too because we do have earnings on deck coming up here pretty shortly. There's some kind of nervousness creeping into that story. We've seen a series of downgrades on the street, Ray. I think, obviously, some concern maybe from some quarters about weaker iPhone sales specifically in China. What would you expect when they report?\n\nRAY WANG: So I'm not sure because what we've seen over the last couple of quarters is declining revenues, but profits are still increasing. And that's because the services equation or the rationale is actually growing and service is a lot more profitable than putting out a piece of hardware. So I would say that we'd probably see those same kind of trends. But we did supplier checks and suppliers aren't like that nervous in the sense that they're saying, hey, we're going to see a decrease. And it's mostly because we're still in a supercycle.\n\nThat supercycle that's going on is because we've got a lot, probably 250 to 260 million more iPhones to move on to 5G and that's going to take you into the 15 and the 16 cycles. That's a lot of iPhones. Plus, we haven't ramped up India yet. So even if China shuts down and China's economy is really, really bad, right, India is the one that they're hoping to pick up.",

        "title": "2 Berkshire Hathaway Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway have made a name for themselves as some of the best investors ever. As a result, the company has gained a significant following that likes to imitate its trades.\n\nWhile no one should just follow anyone's moves in the stock market unquestioningly, it's useful to look at what Berkshire owns to understand what management thinks will be a winning investment. After doing that, I've spotted two companies investors can buy confidently, and one they should avoid.\n\nVisa\n\nBuffett is a huge fan of toll-booth-style companies. The business model is fairly simple: Create an infrastructure and take a bit of revenue from everything that passes through it. Perhaps one of the greatest toll-booth model businesses of all time is Visa's (NYSE: V) payment processing infrastructure.\n\nEvery time a Visa-branded card is swiped, the company collects a small fee for using its network -- and it adds up. This has been incredibly profitable, with Visa consistently posting some of the highest profit margins of any company. V Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFew companies can transform more than half of every dollar in revenue into net profit, but that's what Visa does. Furthermore, Visa is still posting solid growth despite being as large as it is. In Visa's fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), its revenue rose 11% to $8.6 billion -- a new record high.\n\nDespite its top-tier business model and strong growth, Visa trades at 32 times trailing earnings and 27 times forward earnings -- some of the lowest levels investors have seen during the past five years. This creates a strong buying opportunity, and while Berkshire may not consider the stock cheap here, it still looks like a bargain from a long-term perspective.\n\nAmazon\n\nAlthough Berkshire doesn't own much Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock, it is a great buy now. Amazon's business has dramatically improved under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder Jassy, Amazon has discovered something that eluded Bezos-led Amazon: Consistent and growing profit. Amazon has been focused on improving its profitability lately, which showed up in 2023. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon's revenue growth has also bounced back, rising 13% in the third quarter. Amazon is a company that's firing on all cylinders right now, and even though Berkshire Hathaway reduced its position in Q3, I think Amazon is a great buy right now.\n\nApple\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is undoubtedly Buffett's and Berkshire's favorite stock. It makes up nearly half of Berkshire's portfolio (currently about 47%).\n\nHowever, this could be an issue in 2024.\n\nWhile Apple's stock did well in 2023 (it rose 48%), the business struggled.\n\nApple reported declining revenue every quarter in FY 2023 (ended Sept. 30). This weakness wasn't limited to just one product line, and iPhones, Macs, and iPads all struggled during various times of the year.\n\nWhen a company struggles, yet the stock doesn't budge or rises, this is a tell-tale sign of overoptimism. This can lead to a bubble and cause serious losses when it bursts. While I don't think Apple is in a bubble quite yet, it's valued at 32 times trailing earnings and 29 times forward earnings estimates -- an expensive price tag for a shrinking company.\n\nSo, while Apple may be Berkshire's favorite stock, it's far from a buy right now. The other two companies above are in a much better place than Apple, so investors should look to those if they're trying to stick with Berkshire-owned stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. overtook Apple Inc. to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company for the first time in more than two years, as worries over smartphone demand have weighed on the iPhone-maker’s stock in recent weeks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIran Wins With US Airstrikes on Houthis in Yemen Large Backers of Private Equity Are Asking For Their Money Back Citi to Cut 20,000 Roles in Fraser’s Bid to Boost Returns BlackRock Buys Infrastructure Firm GIP for $12.5 Billion in Major Alternatives Push Google Lays Off Hundreds in Hardware, Assistant, Engineering\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based software giant rose 1% to $388.47 on Friday, ending with a market valuation of $2.89 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple gained 0.2% and closed with a market capitalization of $2.87 trillion. It’s the first time since November 2021 that Microsoft has closed with a higher value than Apple.\n\n“When you compare and contrast the two, the growth Apple is showing is nothing special, whereas Microsoft has done a better job of executing and demonstrating earnings growth,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, which has positions in both. “Microsoft also has a much clearer roadmap with AI, and it has done a great job articulating how that will accelerate growth to make its long-term prospects even more compelling.”\n\nWhile both were part of the so-called Magnificent 7’s powerful rally in 2023, their fortunes have diverged this year. Microsoft has risen 3.3%, supported by ongoing optimism over artificial intelligence, while Apple has dropped 3.4% amid rising concerns over its growth. It has been hit by at least three analyst ratings downgrades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWall Street’s less-favorable view on Apple suggests it would not be surprising if Microsoft maintained or even built on its newfound size advantage. The average analyst price target for Microsoft equates to upside of about 8% over the coming 12 months, slightly above Apple’s return potential. Such a gain would result in Microsoft topping $3 trillion in market valuation, joining Apple as one of only two companies to hit such a threshold.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft and Apple remain the biggest weights in the S&P 500 by far, together accounting for roughly 14% of the overall index. Few other companies approach them in size. Oil giant Saudi Aramco’s value sits at just over $2 trillion, while Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Nvidia Corp. are all valued above $1 trillion. Meta Platforms Inc., which jumped nearly 200% last year, is the next closest, sitting just below the trillion-dollar threshold.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top Priority Trumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election Kim Kardashian’s Skims Isn’t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch Five ETFs to Watch in 2024 US Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China’s War Machine\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "You’ll Wish You Had Bought Broadcom Stock at $1,000",
        "content": "Go ahead — pick a reason, or two or three, to buy Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock. Maybe you’re seeking portfolio exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. Or, perhaps you’re a passive-income investor or just want to balance growth and value. By taking a share position in Broadcom, you can get all of the above with just one technology stock.\n\nIndeed, Broadcom is a company that ought to be mentioned more often in the financial press. Granted, Broadcom isn’t part of the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” but it’s a magnificent idea to start a position in AVGO stock before $1,000 is just a distant memory.\n\nTarget Momentum and Yield With AVGO Stock\n\nWhile the press is busy talking about the massive gains in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock last year, they’re overlooking a semiconductor-devices stock that also provided stellar returns. Specifically, AVGO stock rode the AI hardware wave in 2023 from $600 to $1,000.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite this share-price growth, Broadcom isn’t extremely overvalued. Notably, Broadcom’s GAAP-measured trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 32.1x. That’s not too elevated when compared to Nvidia’s trailing P/E ratio of 62.66x and the valuations of some other “Magnificent Seven” companies.\n\nIt’s not only AVGO stock that’s growing. Broadcom’s financials are also growing, with the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 net revenue increasing 4% year over year.\n\nPlus, for all of fiscal year 2023, Broadcaom’s revenue grew 8% year over year to a company record of $35.8 billion. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan attributed this and other positive quarterly results to “investments in accelerators and network connectivity for AI by hyperscalers.”\n\nOn top of all that, Broadcom offers a forward annual dividend yield of 1.76%. That’s an added bonus — and by the way, some “Magnificent Seven” companies don’t offer any dividends at all.\n\nIs Broadcom Just the ‘Poor Man’s Nvidia’?\n\nLike I said earlier, Broadcom doesn’t receive a lot of coverage in the financial media. So, I was glad to see a strategist, Laffer Tengler Investments CEO Nancy Tengler, discussing Broadcom recently.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, I was shocked to hear Tengler call Broadcom the “poor man’s Nvidia.” Tengler also acknowledged that Broadcom is a “leader in AI.”\n\nStill, I must object to the idea that Broadcom is just a lesser version of Nvidia. Broadcom is a disruptor and innovator in its own right.\n\nFor instance, Broadcom is collaborating with Caltech, a world-renowned institute of technology and science. Together, Broadcom and Caltech will work to advance research in quantum science.\n\nIn addition, Broadcom supplies components for the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. So, it’s not really fair to characterize Broadcom as a “poor man’s” version of another company.\n\nBroadcom Stock: Buy It at $1,000 Now, or a Higher Price Later\n\nBroadcom stock will, sooner or later, trade at much more than $1,000. Remember, this is a world-class company that will ride the AI hardware wave higher, just like Nvidia has done.\n\nIt’s also a nice bonus that Broadcom pays a dividend and isn’t extremely overvalued. In the final analysis, investors should take a close look at AVGO stock and seriously consider a buy-and-hold position today.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

        "title": "3 Stocks To Turn $1,000 Into $10,000 in 10 Years",
        "content": "The past four years have been a roller coaster for investors. The pandemic brought the longest bull market in history to a screeching halt, only to see it quickly rebound and go on a two-year extended run. The S&P 500 index then tumbled hard in 2022, only to reverse course again and surge more than 20% last year. Investing for 10X returns might not have been on your mind.\n\nFor short-term investors, it was probably a sickening ride. Long-term investors, though, took it in stride. They understood it’s all part of how you generate real wealth. Every double-digit bear market correction has offered amazing opportunities to buy good companies at great prices before the next bull market roars higher.\n\nHowever, getting good deals is only half the equation. The second part requires having a long-term mindset. You can’t buy stocks looking to make a quick buck. Three to five years is the minimum you should own the stock; 10 years is better. Holding for a lifetime is best. Warren Buffett once said, “The best time to sell is never.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvesting legend Peter Lynch coined the term “ten-bagger,” meaning a stock that grows 10 times your initial investment. If you’re investing for 10x returns and want $10,000, just invest $1,000 in great companies and hang on. You’ll want to own the following three stocks for 10 years at least, probably more.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been a phenomenal investment over the past year and an even better one for the past decade. There’s no reason to believe the next 10 years won’t be just as remarkable.\n\nThe tech giant’s shares gained 57%, earning it a position amongst the Magnificent 7 stocks. Amazingly, that was still only good enough for fifth place in that group of high-growth tech stocks. Yet over the past decade, its trailing returns average more than 27% annually, meaning if you had invested $1,000 in MSFT stock in 2014, you’d have more than $10,000 today. You’ll be able to do it again going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) will be a large part of the reason for the growth. Microsoft is a partner and investor in OpenAI, the owner of the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. It has integrated AI into its services, including its Bing search engine, Teams collaborative tools, and the Azure cloud services platform. You can access the latest iteration of ChatGPT by using Bing Chat.\n\nMicrosoft has been growing so fast that it just surpassed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the biggest company in the world. It’s a juggernaut that will rapidly expand for years to come.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nTelecom chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) wasn’t part of the Mag 7 stocks, but its performance last year could have warranted it. Its stock doubled in 2023, and its 10-year trailing returns are even better than Microsoft’s. Over the past decade, it has returned over 36% annually. It’s also on a long-term trajectory higher.\n\nBroadcom will benefit immensely from the ongoing national rollout of 5G infrastructure by the major phone carriers. It recently inked a multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement with Apple to produce 5G radio frequency components for Apple products. 5G represents the most significant network upgrade in a decade that could spur the next leg of the mobile upgrade cycle. The chipmaker also sees AI as a major driver of future growth. Through its Symantec unit, Broadcom believes AI could represent approximately 15% of its chip business revenue and ultimately encompass one-quarter of total revenue. AI-related products and services revenue already surpassed $1 billion in the third quarter and will frame how it integrates its recently completed VMWare acquisition.\n\nA slight slowdown in Q4 sales had analysts worried competition was growing and enterprise spending was slowing, but Broadcom’s long-term outlook remains unmatched.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt seems counterintuitive for a health insurer like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) to be on a list of fast-growing stocks. It presents the appearance of a staid and stodgy business that belongs in the stock market’s slow lane.\n\nUnitedHealth’s performance last year fit the bill as its stock was essentially flat. Yet over the past 10 years, it offered investors meaty 22% annual total returns. A $500 billion market cap opens the possibility of becoming the first healthcare stock to achieve a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nUnitedHealth can achieve that distinction because healthcare is something you can’t ignore, at least not for long. Doctor visits, prescription medications, and even emergency services are all necessary and in high demand, regardless of the economy. The insurer is a perfect safe haven stock for your portfolio and one to create wealth.\n\nIts Optum health services business remains the primary driver of future growth. Despite the company’s performance last year, the segment expanded revenues by 20% or more each quarter. Home healthcare will also be a key component of UnitedHealth’s future. Last year, it acquired LHC Group, and this year, it will close on its $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED).\n\nWhen you offer services that people literally can’t live without, you have a solid path to long-term growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The composition of Apple’s board will soon change as two longtime members are retiring.\n\nApple said Thursday that both former Vice President Al Gore and former Boeing CFO James Bell will step down.\n\nTheir retirements from the board will become effective in late February, marking the respective ends of a 21-year tenure for Gore and a nine-year tenure for Bell, Apple said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Former Vice President Al Gore attends the UK premiere of \"An Inconvenient Sequel: Power To Truth\" at Somerset House on Aug. 10, 2017, in London, England.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook praised Gore for \"contribut[ing] an incredible amount\" to Apple’s work related to privacy and environmentalism and Bell for the \"important perspectives and deep expertise he’s offered on audit, finance, and so much more over the years.\"\n\nMICROSOFT BRIEFLY OVERTAKES APPLE AS WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY\n\nApple said its policy \"generally\" limiting board members from re-election once they turn 75 precipitated Gore and Bell’s upcoming departures from the board.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP James A.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the16Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors are hopeful that small- and mid-cap stocks will experience a broader rally this year after getting hammered for most part of the previous year as all eyes remain focused on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks amid the AI boom. Noah Blackstein, senior portfolio manager at Dynamic Fund, said in a program on CNBC that market returns were “broadening out” to small- and mid-cap stocks and these stocks are expected to catch up in 2024.\n\nDespite their lackluster performance in 2023, mid-cap stocks managed to end the year at a positive note when compared to large- and small-cap stocks. The S&P MidCap 400 was up 14.5% to 2781.54 in 2023. This was just 5% below the index’s record high level. Compared to mid-cap stocks, the S&P 500 large-cap index was up 24.2% while the Russell 2000 small-cap index was up 15.1% in the period.\n\nAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, Karim Ahamed, an investment adviser for Cerity Partners in Chicago, said that mid-cap stocks provide a decent blend of growth potential (of small-cap stocks) and financial stability (of large-cap stocks).\n\nAs investors prepare to look beyond mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2024 and invest in other, relatively unknown companies with growth potential, we decided to see which mid-cap stocks with high revenue growth are popular among smart money investors. Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify mid-cap stocks with revenue growth rates of over 30% over the past five years as well as in the most recent quarters. From these stocks we chose 16 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nStory continues\n\n16. Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nBenefits management company Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY) is one of the best mid-cap growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In November, Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY) posted third quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $0.16, beating estimates by $0.05. Revenue jumped about 36.8% year over year to $280.9 million, beating estimates by $9.55 million.\n\nPolen Global SMID Company Growth Strategy made the following comment about Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We bought a new position in Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY), a company owned in our U.S. strategies for some time. They are a leading provider of fertility benefit solutions, and through their differentiated approach, their clients can pursue the most effective treatment and achieve optimal outcomes. We believe the company has only a mid-single digit share of its potential total addressable market and is the most dominant player within the fast-growing managed care category. They are already profitable, earn high returns on incremental capital, and have plenty of runway to grow top-line growth as they continue to win new clients and add new services.”\n\n15. Shoals Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:SHLS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nGoldman Sachs recently released a list of 2023 laggards it believes could gain in 2024.

(NASDAQ:SHLS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Solar energy technology companies SolarEdge and Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS), meanwhile, saw headwinds from destocking in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. demand could slow further due to new net metering rules that reduce the value to consumers from sending excess residential solar energy back to the grid. SolarEdge, which makes inverters for solar systems as well as residential and commercial battery systems, is also facing rising battery competition in the U.S. from Tesla.”\n\n14. Confluent Inc (NASDAQ:CFLT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nData streaming platform company Confluent Inc (NASDAQ:CFLT) is one of the best mid-cap growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In November, Bernstein started covering the stock with an Outperform rating and a $34 price target.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter, 34 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Confluent Inc (NASDAQ:CFLT).\n\n13. Shockwave Medical Inc (NASDAQ:SWAV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nMedical device company Shockwave Medical Inc (NASDAQ:SWAV) ranks 13th in our list of the best mid-cap growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:SWAV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also added a new position in Shockwave Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWAV), in the health care sector. The company’s innovative products help clear blockages inside arteries at a lower risk and higher efficiency than other, traditional solutions leading to more optimal outcomes for patients with coronary, vascular and heart valve diseases. We believe these innovations leave Shockwave poised for higher growth, improved margins and attractive free cash flow in a large, total addressable market.”\n\n12. Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nProject management software company Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY) shares rose in November after strong Q3 results and a bullish Q4 outlook. Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY) expects revenue of $196 million to $198 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, while the consensus estimate for the figure is $.194.96 million.\n\nOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 37 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY).

The company reported revenues that were better than expected, though earnings were lower. There was an acceleration of sales for Caplyta, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. However, some investors appeared concerned that as Caplyta volumes increased to a higher level that the rate of growth will slow. We view the projected growth trajectory positively, as well as Caplyta’s potential for use in other indications, so we added to our position.”\n\n10.

And the numbers prove it. The company generated more than $394 billion in revenue in 2022 alone. But how were they able to achieve such staggering success?\n\n\"Beyond the Ticker\" charts its path to becoming a tech giant. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in Los Altos, California in 1976. That same year, Wozniak built the company's first product, the Apple I. Apple debuted the Macintosh with its now iconic 1984 commercial during Super Bowl XVIII. The Macintosh stood out because it was the first mass market personal computer to feature a graphical user interface and mouse.\n\nJobs left Apple after his famous falling out with CEO, John Sculley, in 1985, and subsequently, founded the NeXT computer company. In 1991, Apple introduced the Powerbook line, which set the standard for most modern laptops. In 1996, after a run of CEOs, Jobs returned to Apple. The company purchased NeXT to use its operating system and named Jobs interim CEO in 1997.\n\nApple introduced the iMac in '98, and the line would go on to sell millions of units. Three years later, Apple debuted its first iPod, which could store roughly 1,000 songs. In that same year, the company opened its first Apple stores. But it was in 2007 that Apple unveiled its most important product of all, the iPhone. A revolutionary device, the iPhone helped create an entire business model around apps and the App Store.\n\nJobs suffered from pancreatic cancer towards the end of his second term as CEO. He resigned from the company just before his death, and Tim Cook took over as CEO in 2011. In 2015, Apple took the wraps off of its first new device since Cook took over as head of Apple, the Apple Watch.\n\nJust seven years later, Apple became the world's first publicly traded company to reach a market cap of $3 trillion. And in June 2023, the company unveiled its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro, a mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro is scheduled to launch in early 2024.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",

        "title": "Magnificent Seven Stocks to Give Way to Magnificent Many in 2024",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- If 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven on Wall Street, this year is poised to usher in a broader array of winners.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGoogle Lays Off Hundreds in Hardware, Assistant, Engineering US and UK Strike Yemen’s Houthis After Red Sea Ship Attacks Hertz to Sell 20,000 EVs in Shift Back to Gas-Powered Cars BlackRock Buys Infrastructure Firm GIP for $12.5 Billion in Major Alternatives Push UK’s Sunak Authorizes Joint Military Strikes With US Against Houthis\n\nThat’s the consensus among investors, with smaller and more diverse companies seen to offer twice the return potential of the broader Nasdaq 100 index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWith traders betting on a soft landing and Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, riskier small-cap and unprofitable firms are seen as more attractive. That’s after a year in which Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Nvidia Corp, Meta Platforms Inc., and Tesla Inc. were a go-to trade: regardless of market conditions, they offered both offensive and defensive characteristics.\n\nLast year, “if you didn’t own the top seven or eight stocks, you weren’t able to participate in most of the returns. Investors should be cautious about assuming that’s the way it will be in 2024 as well,” said James Demmert, founder and chief investment officer at Main Street Research.\n\nThe megacap effect on last year’s returns is difficult to overstate. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index more than doubled in 2023, contributing to a gain of 54% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. An equal-weighted version of that index, however, gained less than 33%, while an index of small-cap tech rose less than 21%.\n\nThere are signs this trade is reversing. Both small- and mid-cap tech sector indexes have kept pace since the end of October, and measured as a ratio against its equal-weighted counterpart, the Nasdaq 100 peaked in November and has subsequently dropped. Improvement in equal-weighted indexes is seen as a bullish signal.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on the average analyst price target, Wall Street sees a return potential of 14.4% for small-cap tech, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the overall Nasdaq 100, it is less than 7%.\n\nIn a measure of how short-term market breadth has been improving, roughly 80% of Nasdaq 100 components are above their 50-day moving averages, compared with an October low below 13%. More than 80% are above their 200-day averages, double a recent low.\n\nThe shift largely coincides with changing views over Fed policy and more favorable bond market conditions. The yield on the 10-Year Treasury is down from its October peak to below 4%. Higher rates raise the cost of financing and hurt the present value of earnings expected in the future, and tend to act as an outsized headwind on smaller and higher-valuation stocks.\n\n“Such stocks are more dependent on the economic cycle than the Magnificent Seven, so a soft landing is more beneficial to them overall, especially as they play catch-up after last year,” said Damian McIntyre, portfolio manager and senior quantitative analyst at Federated Hermes. “At the same time, AI was a key driver for the seven, but as more companies are able to enter into and benefit from that space, it should help the rally broaden out.”\n\nThe potential easing of the rates headwind comes at a time when tech beyond the megacaps already look like a relative bargain. The index of small-cap tech trades at 16.6 times estimated earnings, a discount to its average over the past decade. The Magnificent 7 index, meanwhile, has a multiple of 28.\n\nStill, investors are broadly positive on megacap tech, given its durable growth prospects and proximity to the AI growth story, especially as the latest inflation data underlines how the path to lower rates may not be as smooth or rapid as some bulls expect.\n\n“Tech should continue to be in a very vibrant bull market in 2024, but it is one that will broaden out across the sector, and not just be confined to the top names,” said Demmert. Still, he added, “the Magnificent Seven have to be a staple of your portfolio.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nMicrosoft briefly dethroned Apple as the world’s most valuable company on Thursday, with the software giant overtaking the iPhone maker for the first time since November 2021 as worries over smartphone demand weighed on the stock of the latter. The company ended Thursday’s session with a market capitalization of $2.859 trillion, just behind Apple at $2.870 trillion.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nMicrosoft Corp.’s “real relationship” with OpenAI is of high interest to European Union antitrust regulators, the bloc’s competition chief told Bloomberg TV. Tesla Inc. shares dropped in early trading after the carmaker cut prices again in China and said its lone European factory will be disrupted by unrest in the Red Sea. In one of Apple Inc.’s biggest board shake-ups in years, longtime directors Al Gore and James Bell will be retiring from the company, with former Aerospace Corp. Chief Executive Officer Wanda Austin coming aboard. Wall Street may be divided over crypto’s investment credentials but for Bitcoin brethren Thursday delivered validation: The first US exchange-traded funds investing directly in the largest digital currency finally went live. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. shares climbed, after India’s two biggest IT firms signaled a long-awaited recovery in global tech spending may finally get underway in 2024.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top Priority Trumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election Five ETFs to Watch in 2024 US Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China’s War Machine Kim Kardashian’s Skims Isn’t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "71% of Warren Buffett's $358 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 4 Stocks",
        "content": "If you've ever wondered why professional and everyday investors pay so much attention to Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett, look no further than his investing track record since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s. Over this nearly six-decade stretch, he's overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of better than 4,480,000%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 5. That type of return will get a money manager noticed on Wall Street.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha's not-so-subtle secrets to success have been well documented and include a penchant for buying brand-name, profitable businesses with strong moats that have trusted management teams. But the one factor above all others that's done most of the heavy lifting for Berkshire Hathaway over time is its highly concentrated investment portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBoth Warren Buffett and his late right-hand man Charlie Munger firmly believed that their top investment ideas should have added weighting in Berkshire's investment portfolio. As of the end of the first week of the new year, a whopping 71% ($254 billion) of Warren Buffett's $358 billion portfolio was invested in only four stocks.\n\nApple: $165,881,230,011 (46.3% of invested assets)\n\nAlthough Buffett's company entered the new year holding stakes in 49 stocks, it's plainly evident that portfolio concentration in top ideas is a key strategy. As of the closing bell on Jan. 5, more than 46% of the investment portfolio the Oracle of Omaha oversees at Berkshire was put to work in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May 2023, Buffett remarked that Apple is \"a better business than any we own.\" The catalysts behind this statement include Apple's exceptionally strong brand, incredible customer loyalty, cutting-edge innovation, and trusted management team.\n\nIn particular, innovation is what's fueled Apple to a valuation that recently topped $3 trillion. It's been the leading developer of smartphones for more than a decade and is the undisputed smartphone leader by market share in the United States.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo build on this point, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a multiyear transition that has Apple focused on subscription services. While the company isn't pushing aside the physical products (iPhone, iPad, and Mac) that endeared it to consumers, it's expanding its platform to further strengthen the loyalty of its customers while bolstering its operating margin and cash flow.\n\nHowever, the greatest thing about Apple might just be its capital-return program. It offers the second-largest nominal-dollar dividend among U.S. public companies ($15 billion/year), and it's repurchased around $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Warren Buffett absolutely loves when businesses buy back their stock and increase Berkshire's ownership stake in a company without he or his investment team having to lift a finger.\n\nBank of America: $35,561,094,567 (9.9% of invested assets)\n\nEven though it's a far cry from the nearly $166 billion invested in Apple, the more than $35 billion Buffett and his team have put to work in Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) is no drop in the bucket. As of Jan. 5, BofA accounted for just shy of 10% of Berkshire's $358 billion investment portfolio.\n\nThere are a lot of things that make Warren Buffett's portfolio tick. One of those factors is a tendency to invest in cyclical businesses -- i.e., those that ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. or global economy. Bank stocks like BofA certainly fit the bill.\n\nRecessions are a perfectly normal and expected aspect of the economic cycle. At the same time, they're also short lived, at least based on what history tells us.\n\nOnly three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least a year, with none of the remaining three surpassing 18 months. Meanwhile, there have been two expansions that endured at least a decade over the same timeline. Companies like Bank of America can take advantage of long-winded expansions by steadily growing their loan/lease portfolios over time.\n\nSomething unique about BofA that probably caught the Oracle of Omaha's eye is its interest rate sensitivity, relative to other large banks. When the nation's central bank adjusts interest rates, no bank will see a more sizable change to its net interest income than Bank of America. The most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in over four decades has been adding billions of dollars in net interest income to BofA's bottom line each quarter.\n\nBank of America is also trading close to its book value. Buying stakes in well-run banks at or slightly below their book value has often been a smart move for investors. Image source: American Express.\n\nAmerican Express: $28,663,518,942 (8% of invested assets)\n\nThis is probably as good a time as any to mention that Warren Buffett and his \"investing lieutenants,\" Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, love the financial sector. There's probably not another sector of the market Buffett has a better grasp on -- and it's precisely why credit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) has been a continuous holding since 1991.\n\nThe bull thesis for AmEx shares some similarities with Bank of America. Namely, extended periods of growth for the U.S. economy are good news. Long periods of expansion will fuel consumer and enterprise spending for the third-largest payment processor in the U.S. by credit card network purchase volume.\n\nBut what really helps American Express stand out is its ability to generate income from both sides of a transaction. On top of being a key payment processor and collecting fees from merchants, AmEx acts as a lender for consumers and businesses. This allows it to generate fee and interest income on its cardholders and effectively double-dip during lengthy economic expansions.\n\nThe downside to this strategy is that it exposes American Express to credit delinquencies and loan losses during recessions. However, AmEx has an ace up its sleeve: It primarily targets high earners as cardholders. People with higher incomes are less likely to alter their purchasing habits or fail to pay their bills during minor economic disruptions.\n\nAfter more than three decades of owning shares of American Express, Buffett's company is also netting a hearty dividend. Thanks to a cost basis of roughly $8.49 per share in AmEx, Berkshire is enjoying an annual yield to cost of better than 28%.\n\nCoca-Cola: $23,868,000,000 (6.7% of invested assets)\n\nThe fourth stock that, collectively with Apple, Bank of America, and American Express, accounts for 71% of the $358 billion portfolio overseen by Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway is beverage behemoth Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). This is the 36th consecutive year Buffett's company has held a stake in Coca-Cola, which makes it Berkshire's longest-tenured holding.\n\nThe best aspect of consumer staples stocks like Coca-Cola is their operating predictability. Though demand for discretionary items can rise and fall with the health of the U.S. and global economy, demand for basic need goods, such as food and beverages, remains relatively constant in any economic climate.\n\nFurthermore, this is a company that enjoys virtually unparalleled geographic diversity. Except for North Korea, Cuba, and Russia, Coke has operations ongoing in every other country. This allows it to generate predictable operating cash flow in developed markets, while lifting its organic growth rate via emerging markets. Coca-Cola's product portfolio currently consists of 26 brands, generating north of $1 billion in annual sales.\n\nCredit should also be given to Coca-Cola's marketing team, which has seamlessly shifted its focus to digital channels and utilized artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor advertisements to younger audiences. Don't forget that Coke has historic ties to the holiday season, along with well-known brand ambassadors, which can help it engage more mature consumers.\n\nThe icing on the cake with Berkshire's investment in Coca-Cola is its yield relative to cost. Buffett's company has a cost basis of $3.2475 per share in Coca-Cola, and Coke has raised its payout for 61 consecutive years. All told, Berkshire is netting an annualized yield to cost of almost 57%!\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "With the Dow Industrial Average underperforming the S&P 500 in 2023, now is a great time to consider the best Dow stocks to buy. The Dow, a benchmark index of 30 prominent companies, is often a barometer for strength of the U.S. stock market. Identifying these great companies can provide investors with significant gains in 2024.\n\nWhile last year was certainly a great year for the overall stock market, seeking stable returns becomes paramount. As they often say, past performance is not indicative of future results. That is why investors should seek companies in the Dow who appear to be undervalued relative to their peers.\n\nNow, here are the 3 best Dow stocks to buy in January 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is by far the most compelling Dow stock to buy for 2024. While the 2023 year saw the stock soar more than 60%, Microsoft is positioning itself to become the world’s most valuable company.\n\nIt is plain and simple, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) glory days are over, and Microsoft is coming to rain on its parade. Apple has enjoyed decades of robust growth, and has been at the forefront of technological innovation. Now, Microsoft is about to take over and its AI prospects are not something that investors should ignore.\n\nMicrosoft’s generative AI and Azure cloud strategy is just starting to get off the ground. AI tailwinds will contribute to robust revenue, FCF and EPS growth over the next decade. Once AI is fully integrated across its entire technology stack, Microsoft will be able to increase workloads and productivity for its customers. If there is one Dow stock to buy in 2024, Microsoft would be the number one ten times over.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is one of the best Dow stocks to buy in January 2024. While shares have lagged the broader market in 2023, Cisco’s financial metrics have seen continuous improvements.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs one of the leading technology conglomerates in the United States, Cisco exemplifies leadership capabilities in the AI-powered cloud security race. At the tail end of September 2023, Cisco announced the acquisition of Splunk. The acquisition is expected to be cash flow positive, and accelerate revenue and gross margin expansion.\n\nIn their recent Q1 2024 financial results, Cisco delivered their strongest first quarter in the company’s history. Cisco’s revenue grew 8%, with GAAP EPS up 37% YOY. The company’s execution has contributed to strong operating leverage, with software revenue and product ARR seeing double digit growth. With a PE of 15, Cisco is among the best Dow stocks to consider for 2024.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is last, but not least one of the top Dow stock considerations for January 2024. As one of the largest banks in the world, JPMorgan Chase is clearing its path to a $1 Trillion market capitalization.\n\nWith the 2023 fiscal year coming to an end, JPMorgan stands as one of the most compelling Dow stocks to buy. The company has been enjoying favorable macroeconomic conditions, translating into higher revenue growth, profits and net interest income. This has positioned them into their best financial shape in the company’s history.\n\nIn Q3 2023, JPMorgan’s revenue swelled 23% YOY to $39.9 billion. Additionally, the company saw record net interest income of $22.9 billion. In the midst of higher interest rates and inflation, they were able to strengthen their liquidity and capitalize on the regional banking crisis. While growth may slow in FY24, JPM is still extremely cheap, and its fortress balance sheet makes it well positioned to weather any storm.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said she met with the chief executives of Apple, Alphabet and Qualcomm to discuss regulation and competition policy compliance, in posts on social media platform X on Friday.\n\nLast week, Vestager's communications adviser said she would speak to chief executives of Apple, Alphabet, Broadcom and Nvidia in the United States, focusing on European digital regulation including the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and competition policy.\n\nVestager published updates on X on three meetings.\n\nWith Apple's Tim Cook, she said she discussed, among other things, the company's obligation to allow the distribution of its apps outside its proprietary AppStore, as well as ongoing competition cases like the one involving its music streaming service Apple Music.\n\nWith Sundar Pichai, the head of Alphabet and Google, she discussed, among other things, design of choice screens, self-preferencing in relation to the DMA, and also Google adtech antitrust case.\n\nUnder DMA, companies with more than 45 million monthly active users and a 75-billion-euros ($82 billion) market capitalisation are considered gatekeepers, and labelled as such, they are required for example to make their messaging apps interoperate with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices.\n\nVestager did not specify what was discussed with Qualcomm's head Cristiano Amon.\n\n\"#chips power more than just our #digital transition.

Britain's FTSE is down about 2% and Europe's STOXX 600 has shed 1.3%.\n\nThe disappointing run for Chinese stocks continues from 2023, with mainland blue chips and Hong Kong's Hang Seng both slumping more than 4% since the start of the year.\n\nFriday's data releases from China show persistent deflationary pressure and weak consumption, keeping the onus on Beijing for more stimulus measures to turn things around.\n\nBritain has a fairly heavy calendar of data releases on Friday, with GDP and industrial output due to test sterling's recent resilience.\n\nIn the U.S., the S&P 500 and Dow are among the very few major stock benchmarks globally that are positive so far this year, although they are just barely better than flat.\n\nTurning to Apple, it was briefly pipped by Microsoft overnight as the world's biggest company by market cap.\n\nBoth tech giants are worth around $2.9 trillion, with Microsoft steadily closing the gap since last year because of its early leap into generative AI investment.\n\nMeanwhile, China presents a risk for the iPhone maker given the outsized importance of its market.\n\nThe world's no. 2 economy could potentially be problematic for Fast Retailing as well this year: It has 931 Uniqlo outlets in greater China, more than anywhere else, including its home base Japan.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Friday:\n\n-UK GDP est. (Nov)\n\n-UK industrial and manufacturing output (Nov)\n\n-France, Spain CPI final (both Dec)\n\n-US PPI (Dec)\n\n(By Kevin Buckland; Editing by Edmund Klamann)",

        "title": "Al Gore, James Bell to Leave Apple Board; Wanda Austin Joining",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- In one of Apple Inc.’s biggest board shake-ups in years, longtime directors Al Gore and James Bell will be retiring from the company, with former Aerospace Corp. Chief Executive Officer Wanda Austin coming aboard.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGoogle Lays Off Hundreds in Hardware, Assistant, Engineering UK’s Sunak Authorizes Joint Military Strikes With US Against Houthis SEC Authorizes Bitcoin-Spot ETFs in Crypto’s Breakthrough Hertz to Sell 20,000 EVs in Shift Back to Gas-Powered Cars US and Allies Launch Airstrikes on Houthi Targets in Yemen\n\nThe company made the announcement Thursday, citing a policy of directors not standing for reelection after the age of 75. Bell, a former Boeing Co. executive, joined the Apple board in 2015, while former US Vice President Gore has been a director for more than two decades. Both men are 75.\n\nThe upheaval is unusual for Apple’s board, which rarely has more than one retirement at a time. Gore was the longest-serving member — having joined in 2003, when co-founder Steve Jobs was CEO and the iPhone didn’t yet exist.\n\n“Al has contributed an incredible amount to our work — from his unconditional support for protecting our users’ privacy, to his incomparable knowledge of environment and climate issues,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. “James’s dedication has been extraordinary, and we’re thankful for the important perspectives and deep expertise he’s offered on audit, finance, and so much more over the years.”\n\nAustin, the new nominee, has a significant track record of “advancing innovation and shaping corporate strategy,” Apple said. She has long been a major proponent of US space exploration efforts, though that’s not an area that Apple is directly involved in. She will be up for election at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Feb. 28.\n\nIn spite of the age policy, another director, Ronald Sugar, is turning 76 this year and not slated to leave the board. Apple said that Sugar is remaining “in consideration of the significant recent transitions in board composition and the value of retaining directors who have developed deep insights into the company during their tenure.”\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven Apple’s rationale for retaining Sugar, it’s unclear if the policy will apply to Chairman Arthur Levinson, who turns 75 next year.\n\nApple also disclosed the latest compensation details for Cook and other executives. While Cook’s target pay for 2023 was $49 million — about half of the $99 million he received in 2022 — his total ended up coming in at $63.2 million. About $47 million of that came from stock awards, which were higher than the projection because Apple exceeded its internal financial targets for net sales and operating income. For 2024, Cook’s target compensation from equity is increasing to $50 million.\n\nApple’s other named executives — its chief financial officer, head of retail, general counsel and chief operating officer — all saw compensation remain roughly the same in 2023, at about $27 million each.\n\nIn a filing, the company asked shareholders to vote in favor of the board members and executive compensation. And it urged investors to reject a proposal demanding a report about the use of artificial intelligence at the company.\n\nRead More: Apple Aims to Weave AI Tools Into Siri, Music and Apps\n\n“The scope of the requested report is extremely broad and could encompass disclosure of strategic plans and initiatives harmful to our competitive position and would be premature in this developing area,” the company said. Apple is planning to unveil a slew of AI-based tools for the iPhone and other devices as early as June, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\n(Updates with more on board members in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top Priority Trumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election US Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China’s War Machine Five ETFs to Watch in 2024 Kim Kardashian’s Skims Isn’t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "*\n\nMicrosoft briefly overtakes Apple as world's most valuable company\n\n*\n\nCitigroup profit to take $3.8-bln hit on charges, reserves\n\n*\n\nUS consumer prices rise more than expected in December\n\n*\n\nDow up 0.04%, S&P 500 down 0.07%, Nasdaq flat\n\n(Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET/2111 GMT)\n\nBy Chuck Mikolajczak\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) -\n\nU.S. stocks closed little changed on Thursday as news of hotter-than-expected inflation and signs of labor market strength dampened hopes for early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, but a fall in Treasury yields kept declines in check.\n\nIn a choppy session, equities opened higher and the benchmark S&P 500 briefly surpassed its record closing high of 4,796.56, hit in January 2022, before erasing initial gains.\n\nAfter ending 2023 with a strong rally, stocks have struggled to find upward momentum, with the S&P 500 up only 0.21% on the year, as mixed economic data and Fed officials' comments have led investors to scale back expectations for the timing and size of any rate cuts from the U.S. central bank this year.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose more than expected in December, with Americans paying more for shelter and healthcare. A separate report showed the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to 202,000.\n\n\"They're just understanding it for what it was. The thing that pushed it up was primarily shelter,\" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"Nobody believes that is going to be a persistent go-forward problem apart from inflation, so the thing that drove the 'hot print' was something that everybody's kind of discounting.\"\n\nComments from some Fed officials have pushed back on potential rate cuts. On Thursday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said consumer price data for December did little to assure them inflation is now on a steady track back to the central bank's 2% target, with more information needed before any decision to begin reducing rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 4:11 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.29 points, or 0.04%, to 37,711.02. The S&P 500 lost 3.21 points, or 0.07%, at 4,780.24 and the Nasdaq Composite gained just 0.54 points, at 14,970.19.\n\nA fall in Treasury yields helped keep losses for equities in check, after an auction of $21 billion in 30-year bonds was well received.\n\n\"People are still worried about supply in the Treasury market. ... Is there going to be sufficient demand to soak that all up? And especially at the long end, the real fear is at the long end and the auction today, it was just perfect,\" said Ladner.\n\nMicrosoft briefly overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company, after the iPhone maker's shares dropped nearly 4% since the year began due to concerns over falling demand. Microsoft's shares rose 0.49%, while Apple shed 0.32%.\n\nNearly all of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors declined, with only energy and technology in positive territory, up 0.16% and 0.44%, respectively.\n\nCrypto stocks reversed early gains and tumbled, with names such as Coinbase off 6.7%, Bitfarms down 13.33% and Riot Platforms 15.82% lower. The U.S. securities regulator approved the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF) to track spot bitcoin late on Wednesday.\n\nCitigroup fell 1.77% after a filing showed the lender booked about $3.8 billion in combined charges and reserves that will erode its fourth-quarter earnings, due to be reported on Friday.\n\nOther banks including fell, with JPMorgan Chase, down 0.42%, Bank of America, down 1.33% and Wells Fargo off 0.08% ahead of their earnings reports on Friday.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.3-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.8-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 40 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 109 new highs and 138 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 11.41 billion shares, compared with the 12.27 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "content": "Al Gore and James Bell to retire after years of dedicated service\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif., January 11, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced Dr. Wanda Austin, former president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, has been nominated for election to Apple’s board of directors. Dr. Austin brings decades of science and technology experience to her role, and she has a significant track record of advancing innovation and shaping corporate strategy.\n\nAs president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, Dr. Austin led an organization dedicated to supporting the U.S. space program and expanding opportunities for future exploration. She was the first woman and the first African American to hold the position.\n\n\"Wanda has spent decades advancing technology on behalf of humanity, and we’re thrilled to welcome her to Apple’s board of directors,\" said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. \"She’s an extraordinary leader, and her invaluable experience and expertise will support our mission of leaving the world better than we found it.\"\n\n\"Wanda has long been a leader in unleashing the potential of cutting-edge technology,\" said Arthur Levinson, the chair of Apple’s board of directors. \"She brings incredible insights and experience to our board, and she will play an important role in helping Apple continue enriching users’ lives around the world.\"\n\n\"Like Apple, I’ve always believed in the power of innovation to improve lives, support human potential, and shape a better future,\" said Dr. Austin. \"I’m honored to join Apple’s board of directors, and I look forward to being part of a company that’s always creating new ways to empower people all over the world.\"\n\nThe board has a longstanding policy that directors generally may not stand for reelection after reaching age 75. As a result, Al Gore, who has served since 2003, and James Bell, who joined in 2015, will both retire from Apple’s board this year.\n\n\"We’re deeply grateful to Al and James for their many years of service to Apple — their insights, energy, and values have made us a stronger company in so many ways,\" said Cook. \"For more than 20 years, Al has contributed an incredible amount to our work — from his unconditional support for protecting our users’ privacy, to his incomparable knowledge of environment and climate issues. James’s dedication has been extraordinary, and we’re thankful for the important perspectives and deep expertise he’s offered on audit, finance, and so much more over the years.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDr. Wanda Austin began her tenure at The Aerospace Corporation in 1979, when she joined as a member of the organization’s technical staff. Over the following decades, she took on a wide range of new roles and responsibilities, including program management and major customer-facing systems management. From 2008 to 2016, she served as the organization’s president and CEO.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2019, Dr. Austin was the interim president of the University of Southern California. She serves on the board of Amgen, and also serves on the board of Chevron, where she is the lead independent director. She served on the board of Virgin Galactic, the spaceflight company, from 2019 until 2023.\n\nDr. Austin is also a leading advocate for STEM education. Her book, Making Space: Strategic Leadership for a Complex World, explores the leadership principles she learned during her decadeslong journey as an engineer and space industry executive.\n\nDr. Austin earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Franklin & Marshall College in 1975, and a master’s in civil engineering and mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1977.

        "content": "Despite how strong the stock market grew in 2023, there were more than a few pockets of despair in the market. We know the S&P 500 was driven higher almost wholly on the strength of the Magnificent 7 stocks, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 also experienced superb gains.\n\nOf course, the seven high-growth tech stocks also influenced some of those indices’ gains. Where the S&P and Nasdaq are market cap-weighted, the Dow is price-weighted. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $185 a share, weighs in at over 3% of the Dow but has a 9% weighting in the Nasdaq. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), on the other hand, accounts for 4% of the Nasdaq but, by tripling in value last year, lifted the index to new heights.\n\nWhile I had some surprises with my portfolio’s winners last year as a result, some of my biggest losers raised eyebrows too. Let’s see if any of these down-and-out companies from last year can turn into rebounding stocks this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) 5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAuto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) was the stock that caught me off guard the most. Shares declined 18% last year, making it the third worst-performing stock in my portfolio.\n\nThe distributor of automotive and industrial replacement parts through its chain of NAPA Auto Parts stores has long been one of my best holdings. The stock’s biggest drop, however, followed third-quarter earnings. Despite missing Wall Street’s expectations, sales and profits both rose, margins widened and it produced $733 million in free cash flow (FCF) during the first nine months of 2023.\n\nIt’s likely inflation and rising interest rates finally took a toll because the market remains favorable for GPC stock. The cost of both new and used cars remains elevated even if they hit below the highs. That means current owners are incentivized to keep their existing cars running for as long as possible.\n\nI consider Genuine Parts the leading candidate to rebound this year. It’s also a solid dividend stock with a 68-year history of increasing its payout. With sufficient FCF to support the dividend, it’s in no danger of following the route of my next worst-performing stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the largest pharmacy chains, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has been a disappointing holding for years. Although healthcare is a necessity regardless of market conditions, Walgreens has struggled in recent years. Competition from CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was fierce. Foot traffic lagged, it settled for $5.7 billion in its role in the opioid crisis and its medical clinics underperformed.\n\nThat all weighed on Walgreens’ finances too leading to its bombshell announcement it was slashing its dividend nearly in half. The stock is now down 7% in 2024.\n\nBut don’t count the pharmacy chain out just yet. As painful as the dividend cut is, it was necessary to conserve cash. The stock just might be in a better position to grow throughout the rest of the year. I’m not expecting it to top the charts, but if it finally spins off its U.K.-based Boots pharmacy as planned, sheds the Beauty No7 brand and continues its cost-cutting plans, Walgreens could see shares grow again this year.\n\nOrion Office REIT (ONL) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nThe biggest loser in my portfolio was Orion Office REIT (NYSE:ONL), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates U.S. office properties. It’s also the only one of the three losing stocks I didn’t buy. I got shares when another holding, Realty Income (NYSE:O), spun off its office property operations in 2021.\n\nYet it’s not surprising why it’s done so poorly. As a REIT specializing in acquiring single-tenant net lease office properties, it relies heavily on debt to finance operations. That exposes the REIT to higher interest costs and credit risks, especially in a rising interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve ratcheted rates higher last year in an unprecedented series of spikes, impacting Orion’s finances.\n\nAlthough the Fed hinted at possible rate cuts this year, there’s too much uncertainty now. Even so, rates won’t go appreciably lower to improve the REIT’s position. It does have a strong portfolio of properties in attractive markets, high occupancy rates and stable cash flows. The macroeconomic situation, however, may be too tough to fight. I expect Orion Office REIT to be a laggard once again this year. I remain hopeful for the long run, however.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a long position in GPC, WBA, ONL and O stock.

A separate report showed the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to 202,000.\n\n\"Today’s inflation report reinforces the notion that the market had gotten a little overexcited around the timing of rate cuts,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management in London.\n\n\"These are not bad numbers, but they do show that disinflation progress is still slow and unlikely to be a straight line down to 2%. Yet, while the market was probably over-enthusiastic in its initial expectations, the stars should finally align for Fed cuts – most likely around mid-year.\"\n\nComments from some Fed officials have pushed back on potential rate cuts. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said it was\n\ntoo soon\n\nto call for rate cuts as the central bank still had some distance to go on getting inflation back to its 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nCleveland Fed President\n\nLoretta Mester said\n\non Thursday the path of inflation back to the 2% target rate reflected in the latest CPI figures meant it was likely too soon to cut rates in March. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said he was still\n\nwaiting to be convinced\n\nthe pace of price increases will stabilize and inflation gains have been too narrowly focused on goods.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 64.84 points, or 0.19% , to 37,631.42. The S&P 500 dropped 12.62 points, or 0.25 %, to 4,771.38 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 31.90 points, or 0.21 %, at 14,938.63.\n\nMicrosoft briefly overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company, after the iPhone maker's shares dropped nearly 4% since the year began due to concerns over falling demand. Microsoft's shares rose 0.5%, while Apple dipped 0.6%.\n\nNearly all of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors declined, with only energy and technology in positive territory.\n\nCrypto stocks such as Coinbase, Bitfarms and Riot Platforms reversed early gains and turned lower. The U.S. securities regulator approved the first U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF) to track spot bitcoin late on Wednesday.\n\nCitigroup fell 2% after a filing showed the lender booked about $3.8 billion in combined charges and reserves that will erode its fourth-quarter earnings, due to be reported on Friday.\n\nOther banks like JPMorgan Chase lost 0.7%, Bank of America fell 1.7% and Wells Fargo shed 1.6% ahead of their earnings reports on Friday.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.9-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 33 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 84 new highs and 127 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "content": "Whether stocks are in a bull market, bear market, or something in-between, blue-chip stocks are great core portfolio positions for investors of all stripes.\n\nThere are plenty of high-quality stocks that fit within this category, but it may be worthwhile to consider which of these names are in the “Green Zone.”\n\nTradeSmith offers investors valuable tools for determining which stocks to watch. A good example is its Health Indicator feature. This comprehensive indicator provides an overall rating of a stock’s current health.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUsing this metric, you can quickly find potential opportunities to explore. Broken down into three “zones” (green, yellow, and red), you’ll have a general idea about whether it’s best to be bullish, bearish, or neutral on a particular stock.\n\nAs you may have guessed, stocks in the “Green Zone” are performing well, with little indication that the trend is on the verge of shifting.\n\nA stock in the “Yellow Zone” has corrected by more than 50% of its volatility quotient (VQ), a proprietary TradeSmith metric that helps measure a stock’s risk. When a stock in your portfolio goes from green to yellow, it may be a good time to reassess whether to maintain the position.\n\nStocks entering the “Red Zone” have corrected by more than their calculated volatility quotient. VQ can be useful when adding stop losses to your positions. View any move into the “Red Zone” as a warning sign to exit your position for now.\n\nWith this, let’s take a look at three blue-chip stocks to buy, each of which is currently in the “Green Zone.”\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been in the “Green Zone” for over two months. Like other Magnificent 7 stocks, shares in the iPhone maker rallied during November and December, as the market reacted positively to the prospect of slowing inflation and lower interest rates (both positives for tech demand and tech stock valuations).\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while other mega-cap tech stocks have continued to perform well, a trio of analyst downgrades have dampened sentiment for AAPL stock, sending shares lower in recent weeks. Yet while the stock has delivered a far less stellar performance lately, this trend may prove temporary.\n\nWhile analyst pessimism is rising, some on the sell-side have reiterated their bullish views on the stock, noting the potential for Apple to experience growth reacceleration and make major AI-related progress during 2024. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for AAPL is 21.94%, which makes it a medium-risk stock.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) has been in the “Green Zone” for over two weeks. Shares in this telecom firm have long been seen as a “value trap,” but the company may be shaking off this reputation. At least, based on growing optimism from analysts, who believe that Verizon will report improved results in the coming year.\n\nThe prospect of lower interest rates has also been a positive for VZ stock. Many investors are attracted to Verizon for its high dividend payouts. At current prices, shares have a forward yield of 6.81%. If interest rates move lower, this will also likely have a positive impact on VZ’s 2024 performance.\n\nOne thing that should give investors pause is that Verizon is in the middle of a class-action lawsuit. However, the company has reached a settlement and is working to make payouts to impacted customers. That means with a low-risk volatility quotient of 14.73%, VZ is still a stock to watch in 2024.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has been in the “Green Zone” for over two months. Like other blue-chip stocks sensitive to interest rates, increased confidence in the Fed pivot thesis has led to a big surge for shares in this money center.\n\nSince November, JPM stock has soared from around $140 to around $170 per share. Yet even after surging by 22% in a little over two months, recent price trends may continue.\n\nWhy? During lower interest rate environments, this stock (trading at around 10 times earnings) has sported a relatively low forward multiple. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for JPM is 18.97%, which makes it a medium-risk stock.\n\nThe TradeSmith Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTradeSmith’s mission is to put easy-to-use, technology-based tools into the hands of individual, self-directed investors. TradeSmith began as a simple way to track portfolios using trailing stops and has evolved to become a powerful suite of risk-management and portfolio analysis tools.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Apple TV and Major League Soccer are expanding their collaboration, announcing Thursday that the looming MLS season will be chronicled in a new all-access docuseries similar to the ones that have given fans a deep, different look at golf, auto racing and tennis in recent months.\n\nThe eight-part series is already in production and will span from the preseason all the way through the MLS Cup final in December. Apple and MLS are teaming with Box to Box Films to make the new series happen, with executive producers James Gay-Rees (“Senna,” “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,”), Paul Martin (“Make or Break,” “Formula 1: Drive to Survive”) and Warren Smith (“Make or Break,” “Full Swing”).\n\nThe league is entering the second year of a 10-year media rights deal with Apple TV, which enjoyed big numbers after the arrival of Lionel Messi at Inter Miami. Specifics were never released, but Apple CEO Tim Cook credited Messi’s arrival as the reason why subscriber targets were surpassed.\n\n“This is a critically important project for us, the league providing the right level of access, helping identify the right stories to tell because it’s a huge opportunity,” MLS executive vice president of media Seth Bacon said at the league’s media day Thursday.\n\n“If you think about the momentum we have right now with the partnership with Apple, Messi joining the league, launching Leagues Cup, the 2026 World Cup happening in the United States, Canada and Mexico, the momentum is there. We can capture that and use this as another catalyst to attract new fans to tell them what’s happening in the league.”\n\nThe new series remains untitled, for now, with no official launch date released. Apple is adding it to a lineup of soccer docuseries that already includes “Messi Meets America,” a six-part documentary with exclusive behind-the-scenes access to Messi in his debut season — along with “Messi’s World Cup: The Rise of a Legend,” chronicling what he's done with Argentina's national team.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple was part of the group that pitched Messi during his process of deciding whether to join MLS last year. The streaming service's 10-year deal with the league is worth at least $2.5 billion, a huge jump over its previous deal — one that netted an average of $90 million per season under an eight-year agreement with Fox, ESPN and Univision.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

The software giant took the top spot just after the start of trading, hitting north of $2.8 trillion. Apple’s market cap was also trading above $2.8 trillion, but was just behind Microsoft.\n\nThe two companies quickly traded spots again, putting Apple back on top, and continued switching places throughout the morning. Shares of Apple have struggled in the first two weeks of the year, as analysts from three banks downgraded the company’s stock amid fears of slowing iPhone demand.\n\nOn Wednesday Redburn Atlantic analyst James Cordwell said he saw little room for upside for Apple’s stock in the next few years, and that an “anticipated underwhelming March quarter could impact confidence in this outlook.”\n\nBarclays's Tim Long also downgraded Apple’s stock, dropping it to Underweight from Equal Weight, and lowered its price target from $161 to $160.

In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue.\n\nDespite those downgrades, analysts on Wall Street are still overwhelmingly positive; 32 of the 53 analysts tracking the stock currently maintain Buy ratings.

That starting price is expected to be a steep barrier for most consumers, but if the headset proves consumers and enterprises are interested in diving deeper into the AR/VR space, it could be a boon for Apple in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Apple is facing fears over iPhone sales, Microsoft is looking to ensure that its massive investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its own generative AI offerings pay off for investors.\n\nThe company has poured billions into OpenAI, a partnership that is coming under increasing scrutiny from regulators in the UK and EU, and needs to show that its customers are actually buying into generative AI-powered apps.\n\nSo far things are looking bright for Microsoft. In its fiscal Q1 earnings report, the company said its AI tools provided a better-than-expected boost to its cloud business. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure business, brought in $24.3 billion in the quarter, better than Wall Street’s expectations of $23.6 billion. Azure and other cloud services revenue jumped 29% in the quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations of 27%.\n\nMicrosoft is also banking on its AI investments permeating the consumer market, as it launches a new Copilot key for Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The move, which required buy-in from Microsoft’s OEM partners, marks the first major update to Windows keyboards in nearly 30 years.\n\nIntel, AMD, and Qualcomm have also introduced new processors designed to power on-device AI capabilities, adding to the broader AI push into the consumer market. The PC industry is gearing up for a potential turnaround in 2024 as consumers begin to venture out and buy new laptops and desktops after holding off over the past four years.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Microsoft &amp; Apple in Tug-Of-War: ETFs in Focus",
        "content": "The competition between Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT for the title of the world's most valuable company has become severe once again. This is especially true as Apple’s market value has decreased to $2.87 trillion while Microsoft is trading at nearly $2.84 trillion.\r\n \r\nThe competition is not new as Microsoft has occasionally surpassed Apple in market value since 2018, most recently in 2021.The tug-of-war between the two tech giants has put focus on tech ETFs having the largest exposure to these companies. These are Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW and MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC.\r\n\r\nThese ETFs have Apple and Microsoft as the top two holdings. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nAfter rising 48% in the previous year, the iPhone maker has been struggling in 2024, with shares plunging 4% on concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Two analysts — Piper Sandler and Barclays — downgraded the stock rating on worries about iPhone demand. iPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024 due to growing competitive pressure from Huawei and other domestic rivals.\r\n\r\nAdding to Apple's challenges is the tepid forecast for its new product, the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which is set to be launched in the United States on Feb 2. Analysts predict that its impact on Apple's earnings per share will be minimal.\r\n\r\nFurther, the tech giant had offered a cautious outlook for the holiday quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that revenues in the quarter are expected to be \"similar\" to last year, with revenues for Mac, iPad and Wearables categories expected to \"decelerate significantly\" from the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft rose 2% in 2024 after a 57% surge in 2023, given its strength in the cloud business and artificial intelligence drive. The world’s largest software maker is optimistic about the long-term prospects of its Azure business, as it expects revenues in this segment to continue to accelerate (read: ETFs to Tap Microsoft's Longest Win Streak Since 2021).\r\n\r\nAzure has become Microsoft’s key growth engine in recent years and has helped revive the company’s brand among developers, according to CNBC.\r\n\r\nValuation\r\n\r\nBoth tech companies look relatively expensive in terms of price-to-earnings ratios. Apple is trading at a P/E ratio of 28.21 versus the industry average of 20.56, while Microsoft’s forward P/E is 33.73 versus the industry average of 31.88.\r\n\r\nWith regard to average brokerage recommendation (ABR) on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.), Apple currently has an ABR of 1.80 made by 28 brokerage firms, with Strong Buy and Buy accounting for 57.14% and 10.71% of all recommendations, respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Microsoft has an ABR of 1.24 made by 28 brokerage firms, with Strong Buy and Buy accounting for 84.21% and 7.89% of all recommendations, respectively.\r\n\r\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\r\n\r\nApple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past month for the fiscal year (ending Sep 2024), with an estimated earnings growth of 7.01%. This compares favorably with the industry’s growth projection of 6.04%. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and falls under a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 20%).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past month for the fiscal year (ending June 2024), with an estimated earnings growth of 13.6%. This compares favorably with the industry’s growth projection of 13.3%. MSFT has a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of A. The stock falls under a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 38%).\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nSelect Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK)\r\n\r\nThis most popular technology ETF follows the Technology Select Sector Index and has $56.2 billion in AUM. This fund trades in a heavy volume of 7 million shares and charges 120 bps in fees per year. In total, the fund holds about 64 securities in its basket, with Microsoft and Apple taking the top two spots with 23% and 21.4% of the assets, respectively.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)\r\n\r\nThis fund manages about $57 billion in its asset base and provides exposure to 315 technology stocks by tracking the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. Here, Apple and Microsoft account for 22.2% and 20.8% share, respectively.

The company has no \"sell\" rating and nearly 90% of the brokerages covering the company recommend buying the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has two \"sell\" ratings and only two-thirds of the analysts covering the company rate it a \"buy\".\n\nBoth the stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies.\n\nApple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24. (Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\n\nThe weakness in Apple stock follows a series of rating downgrades that fanned worries that sales of the iPhone, its biggest cash cow, would stay weak, especially in major market China.\n\n\"China could be a drag on performance over the coming years,\" brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday, pointing to competition from a resurgent Huawei and Sino-U.S. tensions that have increased pressure on Apple.\n\nThe brokerage added Apple's services business - a bright spot in recent quarters - faces threats as regulators deepen scrutiny of a lucrative deal that makes Google the default search engine on iOS.\n\nShares of Apple, whose market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, ended last year with a gain of 48%.\n\nThat was lower than the 57% rise posted by Microsoft, which aggressively rolled out genAI-powered tools in 2023 thanks to its tie-up with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company a handful of times since 2018, most recently in 2021 when concerns about COVID-driven supply chain shortages hit the iPhone maker's stock price.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, Wall Street is more positive on Microsoft. The company has no \"sell\" rating and nearly 90% of the brokerages covering the company recommend buying the stock.\n\nApple has two \"sell\" ratings and only two-thirds of the analysts covering the company rate it a \"buy\".\n\nBoth the stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies.\n\nApple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Jaspreet Singh; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "title": "Walgreens Cut Its Dividend by 48%: Here Are 5 Better Dow Dividend Stocks to Buy in January",
        "content": "After cutting its dividend by 48%, Walgreens Boots Alliance(NASDAQ: WBA) is no longer the highest-yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But even after the cut, Walgreens yields 4%. And investors might be eyeing the stock as a potential turnaround play now that management has lowered one of its higher expenses and freed up cash to improve the business.\n\nHowever, weak fundamentals and declining earnings make Walgreens too risky for the potential reward. Here's why Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG), Johnson &Johnson(NYSE: JNJ), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and Chevron(NYSE: CVX) are five better Dow dividend stocks to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple's true value add: its buybacks\n\nApple yields just 0.5%, but that's a result of its outperforming stock price, not a lack of commitment to its dividend.\n\nManagement has raised its dividend every year since 2012. And over the past 10 years, its dividend has more than doubled while its outstanding share count has fallen 37.7% thanks to buybacks. AAPL Dividend Chart\n\nApple's cash-cow business model allows it to make dividend raises and buy back stock even during a slowdown, which we've seen play out over the last couple of years.\n\nIt's a good dividend stock for investors who value a quality business, buybacks, and dividend raises more than a high yield.\n\n2. Procter & Gamble is essentially a perfect business\n\nLike Apple, P&G is not purely a dividend play. It also has a sizable buyback program. And the business is as solid as ever.\n\nThe stock underperformed the market big time in 2023. Patient investors should take advantage of the opportunity to buy a quality business at a good valuation.\n\nP&G is one of the best-run businesses out there and arguably the single strongest business in the entire consumer staples sector. It has impeccable pricing power and industry-leading products across a wide variety of categories, including beauty; grooming; healthcare; fabric and home care; and baby, feminine, and family care.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement has a track record of developing brands. The company's performance in fiscal 2023 proved that brands really do matter, even for everyday household products like laundry detergent, paper towels, razors, and more.\n\nP&G operates a high-margin business, with recession resilience and a diversified business model. The only question investors should ask before buying the stock is whether it is expensive. At a 23.9 price-to-earnings ratio, it is trading around the same multiple as the S&P 500 -- which is reasonable for such a high-quality business even though it is growing slowly.\n\n3. One of the best balance sheets out there\n\nLike P&G, Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend King with over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases. It is one of the most reliable healthcare income stocks out there.\n\nBut the J&J of today is different than the J&J of the past, mainly because it spun off its consumer-healthcare products into a new company called Kenvue. The idea is that the \"new\" J&J will grow faster, with a focus on pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\n\nDividend Kings are known for their reliability, not for chasing growth. But J&J should have no trouble raising its dividend even with a more growth-orientated business. The company is a cash cow, generating far more free cash flow every year than it uses to pay the dividend.\n\nJ&J also has one of the strongest balance sheets, with total net long-term debt of a mere $6.4 billion. That's a drop in the bucket for a company with a market cap of $388 billion.\n\nWith a 3% dividend yield, a reliable business model, and a phenomenal balance sheet, Johnson & Johnson is a dividend stock that investors can count on in 2024 and beyond.\n\n4. Walmart is a stock you want to own during a bear market\n\nWalmart is another example where the quality of the business, not the yield, is the primary focus. Its shares yield just 1.5% -- which is far less appealing than a stock like J&J.\n\nBut Walmart is also a Dividend King. It tends to make small dividend raises, choosing instead to reinvest and grow the business.\n\nPerhaps Walmart's greatest quality is its ability to perform in a challenging environment. The business is all about undercutting the competition with the lowest prices and providing the best value for its customers. When the economy is faltering, or there's a changing business climate, it is a safe haven with the sophisticated supply chain needed to take market share.\n\nRecent conditions provide a good stress test: WMT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company's results have been excellent, even as consumers have shifted from discretionary categories to staples. Walmart doesn't have nearly the same exposure to discretionary categories as its competitors, like Target. Years of long-term investments and expansions, paired with precise execution throughout this challenging time, have helped Walmart put up solid results, given the circumstances.\n\nWalmart is the perfect stock for investors looking for a company that is less dependent on a strong economy to do well.\n\n5. Chevron is poised to perform even if oil prices have a steep drop\n\nComing in with a 4% dividend yield and nonstop annual payout raises since 1990, Chevron is an underrated dividend stock. It might not generate the consistent cash flow that Walmart, J&J, or P&G do. But it has an incredibly strong balance sheet and can fund the dividend and its operations even when oil is $50 a barrel.\n\nChevron is also geographically diversified and includes much more than just the upstream side of the industry. It has a sizable downstream business and is investing in low-carbon efforts.\n\nIt can do incredibly well and generate outsize profits when oil is a relatively high or even mediocre price like today's $78 Brent crude per-barrel price. That upside potential, paired with a large margin for error, makes Chevron a reliable income stock in a volatile sector.\n\nDividend quality over quantity\n\nApple, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart, and Chevron are five completely different companies in five different industries. But all five Dow stocks are components for a reason.\n\nEach company should be able to fund dividend raises by growing its business. It sounds simple, but often we see powerful companies gradually lose their edge to competition. Or in the case of Walgreens, it lost market share and sustained ill-fated dividend raises for far too long.\n\nAll 30 Dow components are meant to represent their respective sector as a role model. Apple, P&G, J&J, Walmart, and Chevron do that well, which can't be said for every Dow stock. All five stocks are worth buying in January for investors looking for quality businesses they can count on, no matter what the new year brings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "India eyes import duty cuts on mobile phone parts, sources say",
        "content": "By Shivangi Acharya and Nikunj Ohri\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is considering import duty cuts on components key to producing high-end mobile phones, two government officials said, which would potentially be a boost for companies like Apple and the country's exports.\n\nCompanies in the sector have been pushing for cuts on nearly a dozen components to reduce the cost of making smartphones in India and level up the playing field with regional competitors such as China and Vietnam.\n\nIndia's electronics and information technology ministry is firming up the proposal, including the size of the duty cuts, and hopes it can be included in the federal budget on Feb.1, one official said. It wasn't clear how many components are included in the ministry's proposal.\n\nA decision on the cuts will be taken by the finance ministry when it finalises the budget, the two people said.\n\nThe sources declined to be identified given the details of the proposal, which has not been previously reported, are not public.\n\nIndia's electronics ministry, the finance ministry and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nComponents such as camera parts for high-end phones feature in the proposal, the second person said.\n\nImport duties on the mobile phone components, such as camera modules and chargers, where the industry is seeking cuts, currently range from 2.5% to 20%, according to the industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA).\n\nIt says India's levies are the highest among six comparable manufacturing nations including China, Vietnam, Mexico, and Thailand. Unless they are lowered, India's mobile phone exports growth could slow down, it says.\n\nThose exports doubled to $11.1 billion in the last fiscal year 2022/23 compared with the year before, according to industry figures, helped by government incentives to support local manufacturing.\n\nThe industry expects exports in the 2023/24 fiscal year to rise to $15 billion.\n\nMobile phone exporters in India, other than Apple, include South Korea's Samsung and China-based Xiaomi.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple iPhones are currently assembled in India but the tech giant is looking to expand into iPad and AirPods production too in part to diversify its manufacturing away from China.\n\nLast year, India's trade minister said Apple wanted to boost its manufacturing in India to 25% of its global total and a deputy minister of information technology said the company could double or triple investments in the country, along with exports, over the next few years.\n\nIn the annual budget for 2023/24, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman eliminated a 2.5% customs duty on select parts of mobile camera phones to try to increase the number of high-end mobile phones assembled in India.\n\nSeparately, India's trade department is seeking import duty cuts on more than a dozen items, ranging from engineering goods to inputs for garment production, a third government official said.\n\nThe department for the promotion of industry and internal trade did not respond to a request seeking comment.\n\n(Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru ; Editing by Neil Fullick)",

        "content": "Panasonic Holdings Corp (OTC: PCRFF) (OTC: PCRFY) and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) have teamed up to create smart televisions, integrating Amazon's Fire TV streaming technology.\n\nThe companies revealed the venture at the CES 2024 event in Las Vegas, featuring an OLED model set to launch in Japan and Europe this spring.\n\nPanasonic Entertainment & Communication, a subsidiary specializing in TVs and cameras, is collaborating with Amazon to develop the software for these TVs, the Nikkei Asia reports.\n\nThe Smart TVs will recommend content based on individual viewing habits, considering streaming services, broadcast TV, and previously recorded shows.\n\nThe companies proposed enhancing the personalized approach by creating separate accounts for each family member, analyzing their specific viewing patterns, and searching keywords.\n\nInitial models will require manual account selection, but Panasonic plans to incorporate voice and fingerprint recognition in future versions for automatic user identification.\n\nAlso Read:Intel's Automotive Gambit: New AI Chips to Power Future Cars, Taking On Nvidia and Qualcomm\n\nThe company also aims to synchronize these TVs with in-vehicle displays, allowing the continuation of content from home to car, and with smartphones to analyze app-based video consumption for more precise content recommendations.\n\nIn 2022, global shipments of flat-screen TVs saw a 5% decline, dropping to 203 million units, influenced by reduced pandemic demand and a challenging global economy.\n\nAccording to data from the U.K. research company Omdia, this market shift places South Korean and Chinese manufacturers like Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) and Hisense at the forefront, collectively holding over 60% of the global market share, Nikkei Asia writes.\n\nDespite this competitive landscape, Panasonic has a modest 1% share in the worldwide TV market.\n\nAlso this week, Amazon launched Matter Casting. This new feature competes with Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) AirPlay, enabling iPhone and Android users to wirelessly stream videos to Amazon's TV devices like Fire TV units and Echo Show 15.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis innovation is part of Amazon's push for interoperable services.

        "title": "Apple's headset is the company's biggest bet in years",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro is coming. And soon. The company announced on Monday that it will begin taking pre-orders for the headset beginning Jan. 19 at 8 a.m. ET, and that it will officially hit the company’s online and physical stores in the US on Feb. 2.\n\nThis isn’t just any product launch though. This is Apple’s first new product category in nearly 10 years. It last leaped into a new industry segment with the Apple Watch in 2015. But there’s a big difference between the Vision Pro and the Apple Watch, outside of one going on your wrist and the other on your face.\n\nThe Apple Watch came to market at a time when fitness trackers and smartwatches were already well-established products. Fitbit was a household name when the Apple Watch hit, and people couldn’t stop talking about tracking their steps.\n\nThe AR/VR headset space, though, is still largely untested with Meta’s (META) Quest line of devices standing as the market leaders. And consumers don’t appear to be as hooked on those headsets as Meta hoped.\n\nIn 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that more than half of Meta Quest headset owners didn’t use their devices just six months after buying them. And according to The Verge, Meta’s VP of VR Mark Rabkin specifically called out flagging user interest in the company’s Quest 2 headset during a Feb. 2023 employee meeting. The Apple Vision Pro headset. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut Apple also has a powerful weapon that Meta doesn’t: An enormous number of services subscribers with access to Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. And that alone could give Apple the kind of leg up on Meta it needs to dominate the AR/VR headset industry.\n\n“Apple is walking into a market that has not really taken off…meaningfully in recent years,” IDC research analyst Ramon Llamas told Yahoo Finance. “But, you know…where Apple goes, markets tend to rise.”\n\nApple is entering an unproven market\n\nApple’s Vision Pro headset, or spatial computer, as the company refers to it, will test the company’s ability to get consumers interested in a product category that still feels like an answer looking for a question.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far, gaming has been one of the main reasons consumers have picked up AR/VR headsets. But even those experiences are far from mind blowing. I’d rather play games on my PlayStation 5 and 65-inch OLED TV than on any headset. Wearing a headset for more than a half hour can be uncomfortable, the graphics on the PS5 are far superior to those any headset can produce, and certain games simply don’t translate well to the headset form factor.\n\n“People don’t play 'Fortnite' on a headset,” said Forrester VP and principal analyst Julie Ask. “They're playing it on their PC because it's so fast and the graphics are so good.” A MetaQuest 3 is seen on display during the Meta Connect Developer Conference at Meta's headquarters in Menlo Park, California on September 27, 2023. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nAR/VR companies are also leaning further into the enterprise space, with Meta pitching its headset as a means of having meetings with your coworkers in which you can interact with one another in virtual spaces.\n\nBut let’s be real. Having to turn on your laptop camera for a virtual meeting is hard enough. So, the idea that the average person will willingly strap on a headset to join yet another meeting is a bit hard to swallow.\n\nThat’s not to say that headsets can’t help when it comes to productivity. Using them as a means of viewing multiple windows and apps on a massive virtual display would be far better than trying to see all of my work on a single laptop screen.\n\nIn fact, Apple demonstrated the ability to use the Vision Pro as a kind of high-powered virtual display during a tech demo at WWDC in June. But it’s hard to imagine the average consumer dropping $3,499 on a bigger screen.\n\nApple’s services could be the secret to the Vision Pro’s success\n\nGaming and enterprise capabilities are certain to be a part of Apple’s formula for success for the Vision Pro, but the company’s secret weapon is its services business and the myriad offerings that entails. Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures next to Apple's Vision Pro headsets at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. June 5, 2023. REUTERS/Loren Elliott (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n“[Apple has] a fluid base that already subscribes to their media services,” said Ask. “If I can instantly start watching movies and doing all these other things, Apple, one, has games…they have movies and TV shows and are compatible with my computer and my smartphone and all these other things, I don't have to go buy gaming titles one at a time and build a library.”\n\nBeing able to view your existing apps, movies, photos and more on the Vision Pro will prove to be a powerful feature for Apple, as it works to convince users that they need an AR/VR headset.\n\nApple’s army of app developers should also prove extremely helpful in drumming up interest in the Vision Pro. After all, no one really understood how powerful the iPhone would be until Apple launched the App Store and allowed third-party apps on the smartphone. Getting more developers to build for the Vision Pro will be absolutely massive. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThere’s also the ease-of-use factor. While other headsets require you to learn how to use separate controllers and navigate new operating systems, the Vision Pro is relatively straightforward. Your eyes act as a kind of cursor that highlights whatever you’re looking at in an app. To select an item, you simply tap your pointer finger and thumb together. It’s that easy.\n\nThere’s sure to be a learning curve for some apps and features, but that you can jump into the Vision Pro’s world and start using it right away will prove to be extremely helpful.\n\nAll of that said, it’s going to take a while for Apple to see major traction from the Vision Pro. It’s still a wildly expensive device for most consumers. As Llamas explains, you’d be able to buy a MacBook Air, iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch for less than the Vision Pro. But if any company is going to make AR/VR take off, it’ll be Apple.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is having anything but a happy new year, as the company’s stock was hit with its third downgrade in less than two weeks on Wednesday. The latest sting comes from Redburn Atlantic’s James Cordwell, who lowered the stock’s rating to Neutral while keeping its price target at $200, on fears of slowing iPhone sales and the potential for regulatory headwinds.\n\nBarclays and Piper Sandler also issued downgrades on Apple’s stock, last week, with Barclays' Tim Long rerating the stock from Equal Weight to Underweight and lowering its price target from $161 to $160. Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar, meanwhile, downgraded Apple’s stock to Neutral.\n\nShares of the tech giant have fallen roughly 4% in the first few days of 2024, as of Wednesday afternoon. Shares of Apple’s Big Tech peers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META), on the other hand, are up 1.9%, 2.2%, and 4.9%, respectively.\n\nIn general, Redburn Atlantic, Barclays, and Piper Sandler point to potential weakness across Apple’s iPhone and services segment. Barclays' Long and Piper Sandler’s Kumar both point to China as a major concern, with Long saying that Barclays' latest checks show incrementally worse iPhone 15 data points out of the region, and Kumar citing China’s deteriorating macro environment.\n\nGreater China is Apple’s third-largest revenue driver behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue.\n\nAccording to Long, while Apple should report December quarter revenue in line with market expectations, the company will report March revenue below the market consensus. Apple's Vision Pro could be a catalyst that helps power the company's shares into 2024. (Loren Elliott/REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nKumar, for his part, says negative news surrounding the ongoing Apple Watch patent controversy and antitrust fights could prove to be problematic for Apple moving forward.\n\nMost analysts are still positive on Apple\n\nBut Wall Street isn’t entirely down on the iPhone maker. Of the 53 analysts tracking Apple, 32 maintain Buy ratings, while 16 have Hold ratings. Just five analysts have Sell ratings on the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvercore ISI’s Amit Daryanani reiterated his Outperform rating on Apple with a price target of $220, saying that now might be the time to buy the dip in the company’s stock price.\n\nAnd while he admits Apple Watch bans are problematic and Apple’s multibillion-dollar agreement to make Google the default search engine in Safari might be at risk, there are more positives than negatives to Apple’s story.\n\n“As some of the fears abate and we shift to a more positive news flow (Vision Pro), [Apple] could start to re-rate in a more positive manner,” Daryanani wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring says that Apple’s 2024 could offer a big lift for the company.\n\n“We believe that not only are fundamentals on the path to recovery (albeit with some near-term unevenness), but more importantly, 2024 will be the year when Apple's 'Edge AI' opportunity likely comes to fruition, highlighted by an LLM-powered Siri 2.0 and a broader Gen AI-enabled operating system (introduced at WWDC in June) that has the potential to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle,” he wrote in a note to investors.\n\nApple hasn’t specifically announced a generative AI offering, instead focusing on machine learning to improve the accuracy of its autocomplete feature. But the company is reportedly hard at work integrating the technology into its future products.\n\nApple could also stand to benefit from an expected resurgence in laptop and desktop sales, as consumers who purchased computers at the start of the pandemic begin to seek out newer, faster systems. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAll of this comes as Apple prepares to launch its $3,499 Vision Pro spatial computing headset in February. Preorders for the device start Jan. 19. Apple’s first new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro is expected to get off to a slow sales start as a result of its relatively high price.\n\nAnd depending on how the Vision Pro roll out goes, Apple could drive a significant amount of interest in the headset among both consumers and enterprise users. No, most people won’t be able to afford the Vision Pro out of the gate, but even creating buzz around the product could benefit Apple’s stock price.\n\nWith the Vision Pro launch just a few short weeks away, we won’t have to wait long to see if Apple’s slow start to 2024 is a fluke or long-term trend.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Invest in the Augmented Reality Revolution",
        "content": "Augmented reality (AR) shows incredible potential from a long-term perspective. But until now, many investors curbed their expectations and enthusiasm regarding the technology. It’s hard to be enthused when the only AR your average person has been exposed to are localized ads augmented on the boards in televised hockey games.\n\nSure, cute social media filters are another application that makes good use of AR tech. But I’m sure AR hasn’t lived up to its full potential quite yet. However, that could change in less than a month as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) releases its first-ever spatial computer in the Vision Pro, marking a massive splash in the realm of AR.\n\nExpectations for Vision Pro and the potential of next-generation AR remain quite muted ahead of Apple’s big day. Still, investors should pay close attention to developments surrounding Vision Pro and the rest of the AR scene, as the first round of reviews comes in the first quarter. Whether it kicks off an AR revolution remains to be seen. Regardless, the following stocks seem more than worth a spot on investors’ radars.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple, Inc. (AAPL) logo displayed on a glass surface\n\nApple is quite possibly the leader when it comes to AR stocks, even though most consumers haven’t had the opportunity to try its AR headset quite yet. Indeed, there are a slew of great AR apps on Apple’s App Store. And as more Apple users get a chance to pick up a Vision Pro next month, my bet is the number of AR apps could swell at an accelerating pace from here.\n\nUndoubtedly, AR games and experiences from the App Store are just the tip of the iceberg with the potential of augmented reality. At this juncture, Vision Pro seems to be marketed toward professionals looking to get a productivity boost. Perhaps a few extra screens and the ability to interact with 3D models are enough to get creative pros to pick up a headset.\n\nIn any case, I view the device as a must-have through the eyes of early adopters of tech, AR app developers and those intrigued by re-living memories made possible by spatial videos. In the meantime, I view Vision Pro (note the “Pro” part!) as paving the way for an eventual everyday device for the rest of us.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP), the social-media platform behind many cute video filters, is also an AR play you simply cannot count out of the game just because its stock is a long way from its all-time highs. Despite new heights being nowhere in sight, the stock has been really gaining momentum of late, surging over 93% in the past three months.\n\nIndeed, the Snapchat app as we know it still seems like just another social platform for young people to have on their phones. If you view the company through the lens of an AR investor, though, SNAP becomes so much more than just a social media company.\n\nDon’t believe me? Snap CEO Evan Spiegel recently wrote that its Spectacles product represented a new computing “revolution.” Undoubtedly, truly capable AR technologies could go into future releases of the firm’s high-tech pair of glasses. Though I don’t expect Snap will have AR tech at Apple’s level anytime soon, I would keep tabs on the social firm as it tilts its business away from social media and toward AR.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NADASQ:GOOG) is perhaps a dark horse when it comes to AR. As the company bolsters its efforts to improve its position in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, investors must not ignore other technologies being worked on behind the scenes.\n\nUntil now, Alphabet has merely dabbled with AR tech, at least through the eyes of many consumers. Its Google Glass product was a complete flop and may have been perceived as the nail in the coffin for Alphabet’s AR endeavors.\n\nJust because Google Glass failed to launch doesn’t mean Alphabet won’t be hungry to capture a piece of the AR market once it has a chance to heat up. Recently, Google lost a critical executive employee, Paul Greco, from its AR team. That marked a huge blow to the gut, but I’d be willing to bet that Google will land on its feet once AR finally becomes ready for the masses.\n\nUntil now, Google’s been way too early to the AR scene. But it’s far better to be early than not show up at all, right?\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple and Alphabet (Class C).

        "title": "Microsoft challenges Apple as world's most valuable company",
        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - A recent dip in Apple's stock over worries about iPhone sales has left the Silicon Valley tech heavyweight in danger of being overtaken by Microsoft as the world's most valuable company.\n\nFresh worries about smartphone demand have pushed Apple's shares down 4% so far in 2024 after rallying 48% last year. Microsoft is up about 2% year to date after surging 57% in 2023.\n\nApple dipped 0.4% on Wednesday, while Microsoft added 1.6%, further eroding the iPhone maker's lead. Apple's stock market value is now at $2.866 trillion, compared to Microsoft's $2.837 trillion value.\n\nApple's market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, while Microsoft's value reached as much as $2.844 trillion on Nov. 28.\n\nIPhone sales in China dropped 30% in the first week of 2024, Jefferies analysts said in a client note this week, adding to signs of growing competitive pressures from Huawei and other domestic rivals.\n\nSales of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset start on Feb. 2 in the United States, marking Apple's biggest product launch since the iPhone in 2007. However, UBS in a report on Monday estimated that Vision Pro sales would be \"relatively immaterial\" to Apple's earnings per share in 2024.\n\nA handful of times since 2018, Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company, most recently in 2021, when concerns about supply chain shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic hit the iPhone maker's stock price.\n\nBoth tech stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies. Apple is trading at a forward PE of 28, well above its average of 19 over the past 10 years, according to LSEG data. Microsoft is trading around 31 times forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 24.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report in November, Apple gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand for iPads and wearables.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts on average see Apple posting revenue up 0.7% to $117.9 billion for the December quarter, according to LSEG. That would mark its first year-on-year revenue increase in four quarters. Apple reports its results on Feb. 1.\n\nAnalysts see Microsoft reporting a 16% increase in revenue to $61.1 billion, lifted by ongoing growth in its cloud business when it reports in the coming weeks.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

        "content": "Apple Inc. has delisted several major offshore cryptocurrency exchange applications, including Binance and KuCoin, from its App Store in India, following a government crackdown on exchanges that have not complied with the country’s anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nLast December, India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) issued show cause notices to nine cryptocurrency exchanges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), prompting Apple’s latest action.\n\nThe FIU, operating under the Ministry of Finance, has mandated that cryptocurrency exchanges register as “Reporting Entities” to ensure adherence to the PMLA’s record-keeping and reporting requirements. Many offshore exchanges serving the Indian market have failed to comply, effectively operating outside the established anti-money laundering framework.\n\nLocal users have been advised to transfer their assets to compliant, FIU-registered Indian exchanges to maintain control and mitigate risks associated with non-compliant platforms.\n\nThe Indian government has historically taken a firm stance on cryptocurrencies. Last year, it imposed a 30% flat tax on all crypto income and later added a 1% tax deducted at source, or TDS, on crypto trades above 10,000 Indian rupees (US$120). Local exchanges, such as CoinDCX, have reportedly blamed the 1% levy for crushing the local industry’s trading volumes, driving many traders to seek out global platforms with less stringent know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the nation’s central bank, previously attempted to ban cryptocurrencies — a decision that was later overturned by the Supreme Court. The RBI continues to express concerns, likening cryptocurrencies to Ponzi schemes.\n\nThe decision by Apple, the largest company in the world by market capitalization, to support the government’s efforts by removing these apps from its store, may further damage the accessibility of cryptocurrency trading services in India.\n\nDespite Apple’s move, the affected applications remain available on the Google Play Store, and their websites are still accessible within India, BeInCrypto reported. Binance South Asia has publicly stated its intention to engage with regulators to address the situation, reassuring existing app users that they will not be impacted and emphasizing the company’s dedication to regulatory compliance.",

        "content": "Warren Buffett, often touted as the Oracle of Omaha, is regarded as one of the most successful investors of all time and the sixth-richest man in the world, with a net worth of $121.1 billion, according to Forbes Real Time Billionaires list.\n\nWhile many people believe Buffett's net worth comes from his savvy investments, he owns several highly profitable businesses through his holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n\n\"First, we invest in businesses that we control, usually buying 100% of each. Berkshire directs capital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the CEOs who make day-by-day operating decisions,\" Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 shareholder letter. \"In our second category of ownership, we buy publicly-traded stocks through which we passively own pieces of businesses.\"\n\nInvesting In Insurance\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns various insurance companies, including Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Cos., Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance, Gateway Underwriters Agency, GEICO, General Reinsurance Corp., MedPro Group, National Indemnity Co. and United States Liability Insurance Group.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway generated $21.36 billion in revenue from insurance premiums in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, reflecting a nearly 14% rise year over year. In comparison, Buffett's total income from interest, dividends and other investment income amounted to $4.05 billion.\n\nBerkshire's operating earnings came in at $10.76 billion in the third quarter, up 40.6% from the same period the previous year. The earnings include profits generated from various wholly-owned businesses, including insurance, railroads and utilities.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGEICO Rebound\n\nBuffett has said that auto insurer GEICO is a \"crown jewel\" of Berkshire Hathaway's insurance business and is his \"favorite child.\" But GEICO succumbed to competitor Progressive in 2022, which caused the company to report a pretax underwriting loss of $1.9 billion in the fiscal year.\n\nBuffett's favorite child has managed to deliver a stellar comeback, as GEICO reported a pretax underwriting profit of $1.05 billion in the last reported quarter, marking the strongest performance since the first quarter of 2021.\n\nFluctuating Income From Investments\n\nBuffett's investments lost approximately $13 billion in value in the third quarter, primarily driven by the poor performance of shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). This resulted in Berkshire Hathaway reporting a loss per share of $5.88 on its class B stock.\n\nBuffett has been vocal about the benefits of holding a stock for extended periods rather than panic selling in the event of a market downturn. Apple stock, which fluctuated momentarily last year amid a weak sales outlook, has risen by nearly 40% over the past year.\n\nPrivate Jets\n\nBuffett owns NetJets Inc., a corporate jet charter business that he acquired in 1998. The company was a financial bleeder, struggling significantly since the Great Recession of 2008. The company reported a net loss of $711 million during the recession.\n\nBuffett restructured NetJets and changed its management, appointing Adam Johnson, an aviation veteran, as CEO. Since then, the company has taken a 180-degree turn to become one of the world's largest private jet charter businesses.\n\n“Adam Johnson has performed; you can’t believe what he’s done with the business,” Buffett told Forbes in May. “It was a tough model for a long time, but [Johnson] has brought it where it is, and we should have a wonderful company forever.”\n\nIn May last year, NetJets signed a deal with Embraer to deliver 250 of its Praetor jets beginning in 2025 for over $5 billion.\n\nBuffett's Dream Business: Candy\n\nBuffett's diversified business ownership has catapulted his net worth higher over the years. He also owns See's Candies, which he regards as his \"dream business.\" Since purchasing the business in 1972, See's Candies has delivered nearly 8,000% returns as of 2019.\n\n“We put $25 million into it, and it’s given us over $2 billion of pretax income, well over $2 billion,” Buffett said at Berkshire’s 2019 annual shareholder meeting.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles. Here’s how to join him in his latest venture with as little as $100. Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Beyond Wall Street: Warren Buffett's Multidimensional Success Story — Private Jets, Insurance Brilliance And Candy originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Sustainable Finance Newsletter - On China, 2 early wins for conservatives",
        "content": "By Ross Kerber\n\nJan 10 (Reuters) - While most U.S. companies' annual shareholder meetings are months away, it is high season for jockeying over what ballot items will appear on corporate proxy statements. The bureaucratic arguments take place before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with scores of companies each year seeking permission to skip proposed shareholder votes. Traditionally, many of these items were filed by investor activists pushing companies to take more consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. On Jan. 3 for instance the SEC sided with a labor group pushing companies to report on their use of artificial intelligence software.\n\nIn recent years conservative organizations have brought forward more resolutions to counter what they see as executives' liberal excesses. With some SEC decisions now out, this seemed a good time to look at conservatives' plans for 2024. In addition to this week's main story below, I've included links to our coverage of topics such as the resignation of Harvard's president. And, shipping companies are growing cautious about Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Or, if you have a news tip, potential content, or general thoughts feel free to email me at ross.kerber@thomsonreuters.com\n\nThis week's most-read\n\nLibya's NOC declares force majeure at Sharara oilfield\n\nGreen backlash will spread to European Parliament\n\nHarvard President Gay resigns after rocky testimony, plagiarism allegations\n\nOn China, early wins for conservative activists The SEC rejected Apple's bids to skip shareholder votes on two measures tied to the iPhone maker's record on human rights in China, setting up new tests for conservative-leaning activists who usually win little support from investors. Groups including the National Legal and Policy Center, the National Center for Public Policy Research and the Alliance Defending Freedom have worked to put a growing number of resolutions on company ballots. But their calls for things like corporate reports on transgender care or the costs of diversity programs generally earn only single-digit support, a fraction of the backing for proposals for things like lower emissions or workforce diversity reports.\n\nStory continues\n\nJeremy Tedesco, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, said the pattern shows a groupthink among big asset managers and proxy advisers who \"have lost sight of their fiduciary responsibility to investors.\" He added that \"There's a whole system biased against these proposals.\"\n\nLast year Tedesco's group assisted shareholders who filed resolutions with five financial companies aimed at addressing concerns they had withdrawn banking services from individuals over political speech. None got more than 2.3% support of votes cast.\n\nThis year Tedesco said he hopes for more backing on matters like a resolution at Apple filed by the American Family Association, which his group represents. The resolution calls for Apple’s board to review procedures like how it manages \"disputes between government interests and user rights.\" It cites the reported removal of reading apps from the company’s App Store in China at the request of authorities. Apple declined to comment. A few resolutions from conservatives have done well in the past, such as 37% support for a call for a human rights report at Walt Disney in 2022, according to a review by the Sustainable Investments Institute, which provides research to institutional investors about ESG proposals.\n\nBut the institute's executive director Heidi Welsh said most investors focus their attention elsewhere. “Investors don't think any of the culture-war issue being raised by the anti-ESG groups are relevant to business,” she said. Regulators rejected Apple’s argument that its disclosures already provide the information the American Family resolution seeks. The SEC also turned down Apple's requests to skip another vote, on a resolution calling for it to report how its human rights declarations square with things like its restrictions of news apps during protests in China. The second resolution was brought by the National Legal and Policy Center, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit which also filed the 2022 resolution at Disney. Paul Chesser, who directs the Center's \"Corporate Integrity Project,\" said he doesn't expect any the 28 or so resolutions it will file this year to win majority support.\n\nBut they will help push companies to avoid divisive issues, he said. He noted how big fund firms like BlackRock and Vanguard have already reduced their support for some ESG matters and cited cases like the blowback facing brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev over a promotion with a transgender influencer. “Companies respond to the squeaky wheel, so now we’re providing a way for companies to go back to doing what they should be doing,” Chesser said.\n\nCompany News The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a bid by Exxon, Koch Industries and a trade group to move the state of Minnesota's lawsuit accusing them of worsening climate change out of state court and into federal court, the energy industry's favored venue.\n\nEndeavour Mining removed CEO Sebastien de Montessus, citing \"serious misconduct.\" The action followed a board investigation into an irregular payment instruction of $5.9 million he issued in relation to an asset disposal by the company.\n\nOil and fuel tanker traffic in the Red Sea was stable in December, even though many container ships have rerouted due to attacks by Iran-aligned Houthi militants, a Reuters analysis of vessel tracking data showed.\n\nOn my radar On Jan. 5 a federal judge rejected a bid to dismiss a Wall Street trade group's suit against a new Missouri rule meant to curb the use of ESG investment considerations. The decision allows the case to continue against part of a Republican effort to advance an \"anti-woke\" business agenda. On Jan. 5 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down a request from Republican attorneys general to rehear an authorization it granted BlackRock. But commissioner Mark Christie invited the group to submit their views as part of a broader review FERC began last month of investment firms' utility holdings.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best innovative stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our introduction to what innovation is all about and why it's the most rewarded trait on the stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nInnovation is at the heart of human progress and share price growth. Firms that find unique solutions to business problems or customer needs end up improving their operational efficiency and creating new revenue streams. This leads to more return per dollar for a shareholder than would have been possible through other investment vehicles, in a self sustaining system that requires adept managers to dot all the i's.\n\nWhen we look at some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), one fact is clear. All of these companies created new manufacturing technology, platforms, products, and tools that were not present at scale in their industries.\n\nApple's example is worth a look here. Over the past decade, Apple's revenue has grown by 124%, providing its dividend shareholders with excellent value for their capital that is re-invested in the company through retained earnings. Apple had bled $1.8 billion in net losses during its fiscal years ending in the September of 1996 and 1997. Now, it's the world's most profitable non-state-owned company that generated $96.9 billion in profit during its previous fiscal year. Apple's success in the business world is attributed to its unique product design and the uncanny ability of its founder Steve Jobs to figure out key customer pain points before rival firms could catch on. The ability to design the right product and market it blends with the firm's complex supply chain that covers 50 countries and saw more than eight hundred independent assessments in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while Apple's shares and revenue are right at the top of the global food chain when it comes to innovation leading to triple digit growth, it is Tesla that is dominating the innovation space right now. The firm's revenue has grown by 826% on an absolute basis since 2010, since the market that it caters to is simply too big for Tesla to ever capture. Millions of cars roam the roads every day, and while it's easy to get an internal combustion (IC) car for low prices, a Tesla often costs tens of thousands of dollars. The lower cost market is a key Tesla objective, and its triple digit revenue growth is explained by the firm's innovation in manufacturing and mass producing a fundamentally different product in the market.\n\nWhile most companies on our list so far are mega-cap stocks, the one firm that isn't is Intel. Intel is the world's biggest processor company that designs and manufactures its own chips. This has been the case for quite some time now, and despite multiple slippages over the past decade, Intel still dominates simply due to its early found ability to double computing power every new processor generation. This ability enabled it to cement a market share right when computers were becoming powerful, and today, Intel is a corporate giant that controls the majority of x86 processor markets.\n\nLooking at these companies, it's clear that innovation is indispensable when aiming for success in the business world. Today, we'll look at which innovative companies are on hedge funds' radar and the notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 15 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now\n\nturtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best innovative stocks to buy, we ranked the top 30 holdings of the First Trust Innovation Leaders ETF (ILDR) by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of Q3 2023 end.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) shares were downgraded from \"Buy\" to \"Neutral\" at Redburn Atlantic, with the price target unchanged at $200. Analysts there argue there is \"little room for upside\" in the stock. Meanwhile analysts at KeyBanc are keeping their \"Sector Weight\" rating on Apple, but are warning of below-average growth in the first first quarter. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the latest analyst commentary on Apple.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, let's take a look at another top trending stock here and that is more stark warnings on Apple. Redburn Atlantic downgrading the tech giant to neutral from buy this morning citing, quote, \"little room for upside over the next few years.\" KeyBanc is keeping its sector weight rating on Apple, but warning of below average growth for the first quarter.\n\nThis all goes back to exactly what that growth is going to look like. There was a bit of a reason to be, I guess, cautiously optimistic-- that seems to be a theme here in 20 tickers this morning-- about what we could see from Apple in the current quarter because yes, we are seeing weakness. We have heard a number of analysts come out talking about the fact that demand might not match expectations. But these checks at least from KeyBanc showing that it's actually holding up maybe better than some of the other analysts had been saying within their checks. So lots of focus is going to be on the iPhone 15 sale numbers and, of course, whether or not we see any follow through here to the first quarter of the year.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah, I mean, it's just such a Goldilocks scenario that we're looking at for Apple here. You're looking at the company that, of course, as they attract that and cracked that $3 trillion market cap last year, ultimately going forward from here there's going to be two major questions. When do we see the company get to a services annualized run rate of $100 billion?\n\nStory continues\n\nJust wrap your minds around that. One segment of Apple's business could be worth $100 billion over the next year, two years perhaps and it's just services. But what also makes that ecosystem sticky is the range of products.\n\nAnd so as of right now, it's not like the Vision Pro is going to make people just fly out of their couches, out the door into the car to go pick up a VR headset. That's probably not it, not at 3,500 bucks. But what are they probably going to do? They're probably going to be updating some of those wearables that they might have.\n\nThey might also have to eventually get into one of the new iPhones. I mean, every time I get an iOS update, I feel like my phone works just a little bit worse. So at the end of the day, that cyclical life cycle or the life cycle that we see and the turnover and churn of some of the previous models is something that we perhaps should be watching and what in the next super cycle will emerge.",

        "title": "Apple downgraded, Home Depot upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "content": "Apple downgraded, Home Depot upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nWedbush upgraded Home Depot(HD) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $380, up from $330. Although home improvement retail demand weakened in 2023 on the back of spiking interest rates, plummeting existing home sales, consumer spending shifting to services and unwinding of pulled forward demand throughout the pandemic, the firm believes many of these key drivers are bottoming or reversing, which should translate to stronger demand in 2024. Goldman Sachs upgraded Toast (TOST) to Buy from Neutral with a $24 price target. The firm thinks the market is not accounting for what it expects to be materially better profitability trends in 2024 for Toast. Truist upgraded Virgin Galactic(SPCE) to Hold from Sell with a price target of $3, up from $1. The company's decision to halt commercial operations mid-2024 to focus on deploying capital towards the development of the Delta fleet is prudent but removes the likelihood of any significant upside or downside catalysts in the near-term, the firm tells investors in a research note. Jefferies upgraded AB InBev(BUD) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $76, up from $60. The firm says AB InBev's \"repaired\" balance sheet increases optionality on cash returns, driving double-digit total return and a re-rating as the company \"builds a reputation as a consistent compounder.\" Susquehanna upgraded C.H. Robinson(CHRW) to Neutral from Negative with a price target of $80, up from $72. The firm feels \"good\" about transport demand into 2024, both domestically within truckload and in international trade, but thinks there's too much 2024 estimate risk from pricing to be constructive on truckload-related shares today.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nRedburn Atlantic downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $200. While the firm expects the iPhone to return to growth in 2024, it sees little room for upside over the next few years, and says an \"anticipated underwhelming\" March quarter could impact confidence in this outlook.  BofA downgraded Zillow (ZG) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $60, up from $47. The firm believes the stock is pricing a steady recovery in housing in 2024 with shares are up over 40% year-over-year, but it argues that near record low home affordability could limit volume upside, even with lower rates.  Goldman Sachs downgraded Etsy (ETSY) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $80, down from $84. The firm sees a more balanced risk/reward for the shares from here on low visibility on 2024 gross merchandise sales growth and long-term Street estimates that it believes already fully capture the company's growth potential.  Argus downgraded Constellation Brands(STZ) to Hold from Buy. Constellation Brands is likely to benefit from high single-digit growth in its beer business, but stubbornly high packaging costs, competition from craft brewers, and higher operating expenses remain a concern, the firm tells investors in a research note.  Citi downgraded Charles Schwab(SCHW) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $70, down from $75, and opened a \"90-day negative catalyst watch\" on the shares. Following the recent share strength, the firm sees a more balanced risk/reward at current levels and views Schwab's valuation as fair.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nBMO Capital initiated coverage of Affirm (AFRM) with a Market Perform rating and $44 price target. While Affirm is a leading buy-now-pay-later service provider with an \"impressively long runway\" for ongoing payments volume growth, the shares almost tripled going into year-end, the firm notes.  Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Revolve Group(RVLV) with a Sell rating and $12 price target. The firm sees a less attractive 12 month risk/reward, saying the pressure seen across the high-end online apparel industry could persist and lead to further downward revisions to Street estimates.  JPMorgan reinstated coverage of Omnicom (OMC) with an Overweight rating and price target of $106, up from $100, following a period of restriction. Omnicom is the firm's preferred pick in the agency space.  BMO Capital initiated coverage of SoFi Technologies(SOFI) with a Market Perform rating and $9 price target. The company's loan sales have declined and its outlook for loan growth is subsequently tempered, the firm says.  Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of 16 consumer and specialty finance stocks, saying it believes the outlook for the consumer credit cycle is mixed, but priced for greater economic weakness than seems likely. The firm put Buy ratings on Ally (ALLY), American Express (AXP), Mr. Cooper(COOP), First American(FAF), OneMain (OMF), PennyMac Financial(PFSI), SLM (SLM) and Synchrony (SYF). It put Hold ratings on Capital One(COF), Discover (DFS), Fidelity National(FNF), Navient (NAVI), PennyMac Mortgage (PMT), Rocket Companies(RKT), SoFi Technologies(SOFI) and UWM Holdings(UWMC).",

        "title": "Want to Beat the Average Stock Market Return? Here Are 10 Stocks to Help",
        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index has delivered a gain of 67,036% (including dividends) since it was established in 1957. That translates to an average annual return of 10.2%, compounded.\n\nThat's more than twice the return investors could earn if they held cash right now, even with interest rates at a 15-year high.\n\nBut, historically, investors who purchased specific individual stocks have far outperformed the return of the S&P 500. I'm going to share 10 stocks that have crushed the index since their initial public offering (IPO), and they have the potential to help you beat the market going forward, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms: 826% return since IPO\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Its stock came public in 2012, and it has since gained 826%, which translates to a compound annual return of 22.4%. That's twice the long-run average of the S&P 500.\n\nBut it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Meta stock fell 76% from peak to trough between 2021 and 2022 and then roared back to life with a 194% gain in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), the company delivered a record amount of revenue, and its net income (profit) surged 163% year over year.\n\nMeta stock is still cheap relative to the broader technology sector, and more market-beating returns might be ahead this year and beyond as the company ramps up its investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks: 1,920% return since IPO\n\nThe next market-beating stock is Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW), a world-leading cybersecurity company that came public in 2012. Its stock has soared by 1,920% since then, or by a compound annual rate of 31.4%, and it spent much of 2023 making record highs.\n\nInvestors have rewarded the company's growing investments in futuristic AI-powered cybersecurity, which are already attracting significant amounts of revenue. Palo Alto's one-year-old Cortex XSIAM product is a security operations solution designed to reduce reliance on human-led, manual incident response with the help of AI. It has already amassed $1 billion in bookings, with one large organization using it to protect 300,000 computers and devices (endpoints).\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto is on track to deliver a record-high $8.2 billion in total revenue during the current fiscal year 2024 (ending July 31, 2024). Considering that the cost of cyberattacks continues to soar, investing in one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the world might be a great move for your money going forward.\n\n3. Alphabet (Google): 6,311% return since IPO\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, but it's also home to other famous tech subsidiaries like YouTube and self-driving vehicle developer Waymo. Google stock came public in 2004 (it changed its name to Alphabet in 2015), and it has since delivered a return of 6,311%. That's equivalent to a compound annual gain of 24.5%.\n\nAdvertising dollars generated from Google Search remain Alphabet's single largest source of revenue, but a notable contribution also comes from its cloud computing platform, Google Cloud. It's growing in importance because it's where the conglomerate monetizes many of its AI initiatives, from new data center chips to large language models that form the foundation of AI software applications.\n\nLike Meta, Alphabet stock also trades at an attractive valuation compared to its big-tech peers, and that could pave the way for more upside going forward.\n\n4. Netflix: 44,146% return since IPO\n\nNext up is streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). It came public in 2002, shortly after the dot-com tech bubble burst, and its stock has delivered a red-hot gain of 44,146% since then. That translates to an annual return of 33.7%, compounded.\n\nNetflix has disrupted everything from video rental stores to cable television. Its streaming service has become the largest in the world, with 247 million paying members, and the company continues to grow its addressable market by offering cheaper subscription tiers and by expanding into new territories.\n\nNetflix is the only stand-alone streaming provider generating a profit, which bodes well for its long-term staying power compared to its peers, many of which are slashing costs right now. That could lead to more market share for Netflix over time and more gains for its stock. Image source: Netflix.\n\n5. Apple: 181,080% return since IPO\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's first $3 trillion company, and its stock has been one of the best performers in the history of the market. It has delivered a gain of 181,080% since its IPO in 1980, or a compound annual return of 19%.\n\nThe iPhone smartphone has become the company's biggest value creator, leading to other billion-dollar hardware products like the Watch and AirPods. Apple also has a booming services segment led by the subscription-based Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV. But AI might be one of the biggest reasons to own the stock going forward.\n\nThe company's iPhone 15 Pro features an Apple-designed A17 Pro chip that can process AI workloads on-device. It's reportedly working on a large language model and AI chatbot, and the ability to run such applications on the smartphone (as opposed to in the cloud) could mark a new dawn in mobile computing and pave the way for new features. It's hard to go wrong owning this tried-and-true long-term performer.\n\n6. Amazon: 193,553% return since IPO\n\nIt started out selling books online in 1994, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has transformed into one of the most diversified technology companies in the world. It came public in 1997, and its stock has soared by 193,553% since. That's a compound annual return of 33.8%, tripling the long-run average annual return of the S&P 500.\n\nE-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, but the company draws most of its profit from its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is spearheading the company's AI initiatives, from developing data center chips to helping businesses develop their own AI applications. Amazon even purchased a $4 billion stake in leading AI start-up Anthropic late last year.\n\nBut there's even more to this company. Its streaming service -- Prime -- is second only to Netflix in memberships, and its digital advertising business is one of the fastest-growing pieces of the entire company. Simply put, Amazon stock is a great way for investors to expose their portfolios to the digital economy, and it's trading at a very attractive valuation. Image source: Amazon.\n\n7. Nvidia: 196,288% return since IPO\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the star of 2023, logging a bigger gain than any other stock in the S&P 500. It has a history of spectacular growth; it came public in 1999, and since then, its stock has surged 196,288%. That translates to a 37.2% annual return, compounded.\n\nNvidia's business is currently driven by astronomical demand for its AI data center chips, specifically the H100 and upcoming H200. The world's largest data center operators have raced to give their business customers access to enough computing power to handle AI workloads so they can develop applications and integrate productivity-boosting AI into their workflows. Nvidia has a dominant market share in this area, and there are very few viable alternatives right now.\n\nIn the recent fiscal year 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's data center revenue surged by a whopping 279% year over year, to $14.5 billion. The company's Q4 forecast suggests it will end the year with a record $58.8 billion in total revenue, and Wall Street predicts it could deliver $92.2 billion in fiscal 2025. In other words, there appears to be plenty of growth left in the tank.\n\n8. Oracle: 221,826% return since IPO\n\nFounded in 1977, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is one of America's oldest technology companies. It executed its IPO in 1986, and its stock has since recorded a gain of 221,826%, translating to a compound annual return of 23.1%.\n\nOracle started out developing database management software, but today it's a leading provider of cloud-based applications designed to boost productivity in dozens of industries. Investors are intently focused on the infrastructure segment of Oracle's cloud business because the company says its Nvidia GPU chip clusters can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of other leading cloud providers.\n\nOracle has already signed up leading AI start-ups like Cohere and Elon Musk's xAI, and the company is now building 100 new data centers (on top of its existing 66) because it can't keep up with demand. Therefore, now could be a great time to buy Oracle stock ahead of what could be a growth surge in the coming years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n9. Microsoft: 504,247% return since IPO\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is nipping at Apple's heels for the title of world's most valuable company. It has a market cap of $2.7 trillion, so it isn't far away. However, Microsoft has delivered a much larger gain than Apple since its IPO in 1986 (it came public with a much smaller valuation). Microsoft stock has soared 504,247% to date, or by 25.9% compounded annually.\n\nMicrosoft still operates some of its flagship software products, like the Windows operating system and Word. But it also expanded into hardware (computers and devices), gaming, cloud computing, and AI. Last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in leading AI start-up OpenAI, which developed the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models into its Azure cloud platform, Bing search engine, 365 document suite, and Edge internet browser, among other products. It's allowing the company to successfully monetize AI already, with 18,000 businesses signed up to its Azure OpenAI Service cloud segment and tens of thousands of organizations using its AI Copilot tool for 365 in the early access program.\n\nThose AI integrations could drive the next leg of Microsoft's growth, and with its stock near an all-time high, investors certainly appear optimistic.\n\n10. Berkshire Hathaway: 3,787,464% return since IPO\n\nFinally, the stock on this list that has created the most value is Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). It's an investment company led by none other than Warren Buffett, who steered it to a 3,787,464% increase in value between 1965 (when he took the helm) and 2022.\n\nThat is a compound annual return of 19.8%, and while it's a lesser yearly gain than some other stocks I've mentioned, Berkshire's ability to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 on a consistent basis for 58 years shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nBerkshire owns a $358 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, with large positions in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. It also wholly owns private companies like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Its diverse exposure to so many different industries has been the secret sauce to its consistent returns over such a long period of time.\n\nIf you're looking for a stock with a solid track record of crushing the S&P 500, then look no further.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Apple cut to Neutral on 'full' valuation: 4 big analyst cuts",
        "content": "Investing.com — Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst cuts you may have missed since yesterday: downgrades at Apple, Charles Schwab , Etsy, and Zillow Group.\n\nLooking to build a market-betting portfolio for 2024? Join InvestingPro now and access the AI-powered strategy that outperformed the market by 670% over the last decade.\n\nApple cut to Neutral\n\nRedburn-Atlantic downgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $200.00, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.\n\nThe analysts noted that while there is an expectation for the iPhone to return to growth in 2024, the prospects for significant upside in the coming years seem limited. Additionally, concerns are raised about a potentially lackluster March quarter, which could affect confidence in this growth outlook. The analysts also pointed out the increasing regulatory risks that may impact Apple's ability to monetize its ecosystem effectively.\n\nLooking ahead, we forecast Services’ contribution to EPS to continue to increase, but only relatively modestly, reaching 49% at YE26 compared to 46% currently. As a result, we see limited potential for further multiple expansion from evolving business mix.\n\nCharles Schwab downgraded at Citi\n\nCiti downgraded Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target to $70.00 from $75.00.\n\nThe bank opened a 90-day negative catalyst watch in anticipation of two key events: the expected release of SEC equity market structure rules in early 2024, and the Thinkorswim client conversion to the new Schwab platform in the first half of 2024.\n\nWhile the analysts don't foresee the more impactful SEC rules, such as auctions, being implemented in their original form, the announcement of these rules could pose a headline risk to Schwab’s stock. This is particularly relevant considering the $90-100 million per quarter Schwab has been receiving in equity Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) in 2023.\n\nWe also see some risk related to the upcoming Thinkorswim client conversion to the new SCHW platform given expectations for other brokerage platforms to make a strong marketing push to capture some of these active traders.\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo more downgrades\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) shares fell more than 1% pre-market today after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target to $80.00 from $84.00.\n\nAccording to the analysts, the downgrade primarily reflects a more balanced risk-reward ratio at Etsy's current market levels. Despite the change in rating, there is still a long-term belief in Etsy's unique positioning within the broader eCommerce sector. The expectation is that Etsy's Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) will regain momentum, potentially reaching a high single-digit to 10% growth rate once the current challenges in discretionary online spending subside.\n\nZillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) shares plunged more than 3% pre-market today after BofA Securities downgraded the company to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $60.00 (from $47.00).\n\nThe analysts noted that the downgrade is based on the belief that Zillow's stock currently reflects an anticipated steady recovery in the housing market for 2024, as evidenced by the over 40% year-over-year increase in its share price. Additionally, the analysts pointed out that near-record low home affordability could constrain the potential for volume growth, even with lower interest rates. Additionally, the ongoing real estate commission lawsuits present a significant challenge to Zillow's buy-side agent lead generation segment, which accounts for nearly half of the company's revenue.\n\nTake your investing game to the next level in 2024 with ProPicks\n\nInstitutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.\n\nNow, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.\n\nWith our six strategies, including the flagship \"Tech Titans,\" which outperformed the market by a lofty 952% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.\n\nSubscribe here for up to 50% off as part of our year-end sale and never miss a bull market again!\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple cut to Neutral on 'full' valuation: 4 big analyst cuts\n\nUS stocks edge higher; investors await CPI data, big bank earnings\n\nServiceNow momentum to continue, according to Evercore ISI",

        "title": "TSMC Halts Sales Declines After AI Demand Offsets Chip Malaise",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s fourth-quarter revenue beat estimates of a decline, as demand from artificial intelligence players helped offset sluggish smartphone and laptop chip sales.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSEC X Account Compromised to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETFs Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff Bottled Water Contains More Plastic Particles Than Previously Thought US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\n\nHsinchu-based TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., reported December sales of NT$176.3 billion ($5.7 billion), completing a NT$625.5 billion quarter. That matched earnings from the same period a year earlier, which was among TSMC’s highest quarterly results. The average analyst estimate for sales over the last three months was NT$616.2 billion.\n\nOver the course of 2023, TSMC moderated its capital expenditure plans as the consumer electronics industry grappled with a glut of unsold inventory. The chipmaker signaled the trough in demand had been reached in the summer and recovery would begin to take hold in the months leading up to 2024. Overall revenue declined 4.5% last year, to NT$2.16 trillion.\n\nWhile it outdid analyst expectations and its own guidance, TSMC’s $20.2 billion quarter still fell short of delivering growth. December sales were down 8.4% on the same month a year earlier, offering a mixed outlook for the year ahead. Executives including Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei have said they they expect overall business to grow this year, and the company has seen its high-performance computing business boosted by demand for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s AI chips.\n\nEarlier in the week, fellow chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co. posted its sixth successive quarter of declining operating profit, as it weathered the impact of muted consumer demand in its smartphone and memory businesses. Still, the latest report from the Semiconductor Industry Association showed the first growth in chip sales in over a year came in November, suggesting momentum is gathering for a resurgence in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: World Chip Sales Return to Growth in Sign of Improving Demand\n\nUpgrades to AI server farms and on-device AI applications are likely to drive an IT replacement cycle, according to HSBC analysts Ricky Seo and Hankil Chang. “For US cloud service providers, we expect capex to grow significantly, about 65% in 2024e. Additionally, AI server purchases will likely total 57% of their investments in 2024e, up from 8% in 2022,” they wrote in a note on Wednesday.\n\nApple Inc., arguably TSMC’s most important customer, has faced headwinds with its latest iPhone generation, especially in the world’s biggest mobile market of China. Several analysts have downgraded Apple this year on expectations of soft demand, and this week Jefferies said the iPhone sales slump in China is likely to deepen. The US company has also been hit by an expanded ban by Chinese agencies and state-owned companies ordering staff to keep iPhones and other foreign devices away from work premises.\n\n--With assistance from Sam Kim.\n\n(Updates with additional market details)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire Private Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Is There Any Hope for Hollywood?

        "title": "Apple Returns to List of Top US Employers as Other Tech Firms Lose Appeal",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. returned to an annual list of the 100 best places to work after falling off last year, but the ranking wasn’t as rich with technology firms after layoffs roiled the sector.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSEC’s X Account Hacked to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETF Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff Bottled Water Contains More Plastic Particles Than Previously Thought US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\n\nThe iPhone maker was No. 39 in the list from Glassdoor, a website where employees submit anonymous workplace reviews. Glassdoor has conducted the survey since 2009. Apple was one of 31 tech-industry firms on the list, down from 41 last year, leaving more room for old-line employers like banks, retailers and manufacturers. The best company to work for was management consultant Bain & Co., followed by chipmaker Nvidia Corp., whose products underpin the booming artificial intelligence field.\n\n“Tech has lost some of its luster versus the past year,” said Glassdoor’s lead economist Daniel Zhao. “It’s still a great industry for jobseekers, but the shine has worn off to some extent. And the companies making a comeback, they’re the old guard, so it suggests we’re heading back to a more balanced job market.”\n\nWhile Apple’s return-to-office push in 2022 may have been to blame for its falling off the list last year, the tech bellwether’s lack of large-scale layoffs compared with its peers likely brought it back, Zhao said, as employees value “stability and security.” The 48% gain in Apple’s shares last year — double the benchmark S&P 500’s increase — probably also kept employees satisfied.\n\nOther prominent tech firms on the list include Adobe Inc. at 15, Microsoft Corp. at 18 and Alphabet Inc.’s Google at 26, while Salesforce Inc., Intel Corp., Netflix Inc. and Yahoo Inc. fell off. In finance, Fidelity Investments ranked tenth, up from 18th the previous year. New financial firms making an appearance include Raymond James Financial at 14, Barclays Plc at 72 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 82, while BlackRock Inc. didn’t make the cut after being included on the 2023 list.\n\nStory continues\n\nWork-life balance gained importance for many employees last year — mentions of “anxiety” in posts on Glassdoor’s community sites shot up fourfold — but factors such as career opportunities traditionally carry more weight, Zhao said. Bain’s rise to number one for the sixth time was fueled by its reputation for career enhancement, he said, despite the industry’s well-publicized long hours. Bain and Google are the only two firms that have made the list every year.\n\nWith some tech stalwarts fading — Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. missed the cut for the second straight year — more companies from other industries filled the void. The number of retail companies more than doubled to 10, with Lululemon Athletica Inc. and HEB Grocery Co. making repeat appearances while regional supermarket chain Wegmans Food Markets made the cut after not being on last year’s list. Manufacturing firms doubled their presence to six companies, including medical-device maker Boston Scientific Corp., engine maker Cummins Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.\n\nTo be considered for the list, firms must have more than 1,000 employees and receive at least 75 employee ratings over the past year on nine workplace attributes, such as compensation, culture and senior management. The rating threshold resulted in last year’s No. 1, software company Gainsight Inc., falling off the list entirely this year as it didn’t receive enough reviews, Zhao said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Comes Under a Microscope Private Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Is There Any Hope for Hollywood?

        "title": "Down 40% from Highs, Is TTD Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "While the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index (NDX) surged over 40% in 2023, there are several tech stocks trading significantly below all-time highs. The rally in 2023 was primarily driven by large-cap companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Meanwhile, shares of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) are currently trading 40% below all-time highs, valuing the company at $33.6 billion.\n\nDespite the pullback in the last two years, TTD stock has returned over 2,280% to investors since its initial public offering in September 2016, but can the tech stock replicate these gains in the future?\n\nI am bullish on TTD stock, as the company is part of a rapidly expanding market, allowing it to grow revenue and profit margins at a comfortable pace in the upcoming decade, which should translate to outsized gains for shareholders. Let’s see why.\n\nAn Overview of The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk offers an enterprise-facing demand-side digital platform allowing companies to better optimize their online marketing campaigns. TTD’s portfolio of tools and solutions leverages the power of data, allowing customers to reach a wide range of audiences at a lower cost.\n\nA global technology company, TTD empowers the buyers of digital ads. Using its cloud-based platform, ad buyers can create, manage, and optimize data-driven digital ad campaigns across formats and channels, including video, connected TV (CTV), audio, display, and social.\n\nTTD’s platform boasts seamless integration with key inventory, publisher, and data partners, providing ad buyers with reach while improving decision-making capabilities. Its client base includes ad agencies, brands, and other ad-oriented service providers.\n\nTTD enters into master service agreements with its customers and generates revenue by charging them a platform fee based on total ad spend. Additionally, it drives sales through data services and other advanced platform functionalities.\n\nStory continues\n\nTTD: Positioned for Growth\n\nThe Trade Desk is well poised to benefit from the growing digitization of media and a fragmented audience base, which has increased the complexity of advertising in the past decade, leading to demand for an automated ad-buying process.\n\nTTD aims to increase enterprise demand by developing the programmatic capabilities of its platform and ad inventory. It believes the growth of the programmatic ad market is essential for top-line growth, while the widespread adoption of these services allows the company to acquire new clients and increase spending from existing ones.\n\nIn its quarterly filing, TTD explained, “Although our clients include some of the largest advertising agencies in the world, we believe there is significant room for us to expand further within these clients and gain a larger amount of their advertising spend through our platform.”\n\nA report from Market Research Future estimates the programmatic ad market to grow from $56.28 billion in 2022 to $138.25 billion in 2030, indicating an annual growth rate of 13.7% in this period.\n\nTTD ended 2022 with sales of $1.58 billion, suggesting it had a market share of 2.8%. If the company can raise its market share to 5% in the next few years, it might end 2030 with sales of almost $7 billion.\n\nThe Trade Desk expects the adoption of programmatic advertising by inventory owners and content providers to expand the volume and type of ad inventory for its clients. For example, it has expanded its CTV, native, and audio ad offerings via integrations with supply-side partners.\n\nThe gross spending on The Trade Desk has risen from $552 million in 2015 to $7.74 billion in 2022, allowing the company to increase sales from $114 million to $1.58 billion in this period.\n\nHow Did the Trade Desk Perform in Q3 2023?\n\nIn Q3 2023, The Trade Desk reported revenue of $493.3 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Programmatic ad platforms such as TTD continue to grow at an enviable pace as advertisers are ready to pay a premium for precision and transparency while maximizing returns from their campaigns.\n\nTTD ended Q3 with a customer retention rate of 95%, a rate it has maintained for the last nine years.\n\nWith an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) margin of 40%, TTD expanded its adjusted earnings by 27% year-over-year to $0.33 per share in Q3.\n\nIs TTD Stock Undervalued or Overvalued?\n\nAnalysts tracking TTD expect sales to rise by 21.9% to $1.92 billion for Fiscal 2023 and by 20.5% to $2.32 billion this year. Its adjusted earnings are forecast to rise from $1.04 per share in 2022 to $1.27 per share for Fiscal 2023 and $1.43 per share for Fiscal 2024.\n\nSo, priced at 54.3x forward earnings, TTD stock trades at a lofty valuation, especially since the sector’s multiple is much lower at 15.7x.\n\nIs TTD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOut of the 20 analysts covering TTD stock, 19 recommend a Buy, one recommends a Hold, and none recommend a Sell. The average TTD stock price target is $82.69, 20.8% above the current price.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe Trade Desk is a high-growth company that commands a premium valuation. Still, it’s part of an expanding addressable market, providing it with enough room to grow its revenue, earnings, and cash flows in 2024 and beyond. The secular shift towards CTV advertising in key markets should also act as a positive catalyst for TTD, making it a top investment choice right now.\n\nDisclosure",

The rollout of passkeys to over 10 million consumers globally signifies the company’s focus on a frictionless sign-in experience. Also, they enhance convenience and ensure a secure authentication process.\n\nAdditionally, PayPal Wallet has added fraud alerts for all cards, further boosting the company’s edge in enhancing security and trust. By offering proactive fraud prevention measures, PayPal instills confidence in users to conduct transactions without apprehension.\n\nMoreover, PayPal’s integrates its branded credit and debit cards into popular digital wallets like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). This represents the company’s strategy to gain ubiquity both online and in person. Also, the integration expands the usability of PayPal’s services across platforms, increasing consumer touch points.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the launch of the PY-USD stablecoin is connecting the PayPal and Venmo ecosystems. This is creating a robust peer-to-peer network. It suggests PayPal’s foresight in increasing the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Fundamentally, this move positions PayPal as a pioneer in the digital currency space.\n\nFinally, PayPal’s concentrates on addressing additional enterprise needs such as payouts, fraud management, chargeback automation, and FX. Further, it highlights the priority of providing comprehensive solutions to meet the specific requirements of larger businesses. Therefore, these value-added services address critical pain points for big firms, allowing PayPal to expand its top-line, margins, and valuations.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) impresses with new product launches and the continuous progress of its research and development (R&D) pipeline. These show a forward-looking approach to maintaining a competitive edge in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nAdditionally, Pfizer’s pursuit of innovation is exemplified by its strategic focus on diversifying its product portfolio. The company has successfully executed 13 out of the 19 (as of Q3 2023) initially identified potential launches.\n\nFundamentally, Pfizer has strategic initiatives on the next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate. Also, the pending results for the 65-and-older first-generation Phase 3 standalone mRNA flu study push the company further at the forefront of medical innovation.\n\nPFE’S ability to optimize costs and implement an effective financial strategy is crucial for maintaining profitability and sustaining long-term growth. The company’s cost realignment program targets at least $3.5 billion in net cost savings by the end of 2024.\n\nFinally, Pfizer’s capital strategy revolves around the three core pillars of business reinvestment, dividend growth, and value-enhanced share repurchases. Therefore, these fundamentals may lead to valuation growth for the company’s stock in the market.\n\nModerna (MRNA) red text reads \"moderna\" on a light blue background. there is a bottle of liquid vaccine next to a medical needle\n\nSource: diy13 / Shutterstock\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is progressing toward solidifying its pipeline by boosting R&D expenses, reporting $1.2 billion in said costs. This represents a 41% year-over-year (YOY) increase (Q3 2023), highlighting the company’s lead in expanding its pipeline. In the same direction, the company is advancing six products to Phase 3 studies or pending approval.\n\nMoreover, the increased R&D expenditure reflects Moderna’s confidence in its mRNA technology platform. It has the potential to develop a diverse range of vaccines and therapeutics. This investment flow may uplift the long-term growth potential, sustaining a competitive edge.\n\nFundamentally, the plan to launch five new products is a forward-thinking move toward product diversification and top-line growth. This expansion aligns with Moderna’s strategy to consolidate its position in the COVID-19 vaccine market and broaden its portfolio.\n\nAt the bottom line, Moderna is making efforts to attain profitability in 2024 and beyond, mainly focusing on the profitability of its COVID franchise. This is a strategic shift toward sustainable bottom-line performance. Hence, this goal showcases the company’s intention to move beyond revenue generation to ensure consistent and profitable operations.\n\nAdditionally, Spikevax projects nearly $1 billion in 2024 income despite R&D investments. This suggests the company’s motion towards optimizing revenue streams and improving operational efficiency. Thus, this vital phase shows Moderna transitioning from heavy R&D investment to reaping the benefits of its established products.\n\nFinally, not repurchasing shares in the intermediate term and utilizing the balance sheet strength without raising equity may drive growth through its internal capabilities.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PYPL and PFE.

She has become a top deputy to CFO Luca Maestri, overseeing financial planning, forecasting and investor relations. Casey also worked for 15 years at Cisco Systems Inc., handling finance roles during a period of explosive growth for the networking company.\n\n“The depth and breadth of her experience at world-class companies like Apple and Cisco make her perfectly suited to build on our momentum and seize the opportunity ahead,” Sonos Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence said in the statement.\n\nShe joins Sonos during an ambitious stretch for the company. After a slowdown in its hallmark category — smart audio equipment — the company is pushing into headphones and other new markets, such as set-top boxes and video services.\n\nFor Apple, the move represents the loss of another influential executive.

At a large booth on the Las Vegas Strip, the company is showing off new features that span phones, earbuds, TVs and cars.\n\nAnother feature — also similar to an Apple offering — will let a user start a podcast on an Android phone and then transfer it over to a docked Pixel Tablet at home. The capability will be released this year for YouTube Music and Spotify.

        "content": "The S&P 500 is within striking distance of entering official bull market territory. To qualify, the index would need to rise more than 20% from its previous low and hit a new all-time high. The popular benchmark crossed the first threshold and needs to close above 4,796.56 to achieve the second. It’s within about 75 points of making it and there’s good reason to think it could happen soon.\n\nBear markets are relatively short-term events lasting about 15 months on average. Bull markets, on the other hand, are measured in years and typically run for around 36 months. The S&P 500 bottomed out on October 12, 2022 and the broad-based index has largely been running higher since.\n\nNow that we’re this close to hitting the mark, here are seven S&P 500 stocks that can keep this bull market run going.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not only the world’s largest technology company but with a $2.8 trillion market capitalization, it is the largest company period. It has a 7.4% weight in the S&P 500. Yet shares are down 8% since the middle of December as slowing sales and profit growth weighed on performance.\n\nThe centerpiece of its business is the iPhone, which accounts for 52% of total sales. Revenue hit a new record in the fourth quarter but growth was a paltry 2.8%. For the full year, revenue was actually down 2.4%. All other Apple products such as Macs, iPads and wearables, were also lower from the year-ago period.\n\nSo why will Apple keep growing? Services continue to light up sales growth. Revenue jumped 16% in the fourth quarter, an acceleration from previous periods. Although it’s about half the size of the iPhone segment, it’s going to eventually become Apple’s biggest business. From the App Store to Apple Music, Apple Pay to iCloud, Apple is pulling in money left and right. It’s also hugely profitable.\n\nWhere product gross margins were north of 32%, service gross margins were 70.9%, up 40 basis points sequentially. Apple’s massive installed base of products ensures services revenue will keep growing. There will be hiccups in the tech giant’s performance from time to time but the overall trend is up. Apple is a key driver for keeping this bull market going.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) The Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL) logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nBest known as the parent company of search engine Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also the world’s largest online advertising platform. Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, Google Cloud, and other products and services all contribute to propping up the ad business. Alphabet generated $59.6 billion in ad revenue in just the third quarter of 2023 or 78% of the total.\n\nSearch naturally is the primary driver of revenue, representing 74% of total sales. There had been concern that companies dependent on online advertising would get hit by a recession as businesses reined in spending. While that’s likely true for smaller outfits, businesses also know that if they want to reach consumers they need to be on Alphabet’s platforms. It is facing competition from other ad outlets, including Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Facebook, but Google is still the dominant player in the space. It still owns 85% of the global search market.\n\nYet the future for Alphabet is much more than search. Google Cloud is the third largest cloud services platform, Android has a 70% share of the mobile market, Gmail is the de facto email service, and so forth. Alphabet also promises to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI). It claims its generative AI model Gemini is the “largest, most capable and most general” AI system. The Pixel 8 Pro smartphone is the first smartphone to be powered by AI. Expect Alphabet to be front and center in the bull market.\n\nPaycom Software (PAYC)\n\nSource: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cloud-based payroll company, Paycom Software (NASDAQ:PAYC) provides payroll, talent acquisition, time and labor management, and other business solutions. But after racing higher across the first half of 2023, Paycom stock fell off the table. From peak to trough it lost over 60% of its value in just three months. Now it’s climbing higher once more.\n\nPaycom’s Beti software is a paradigm shift in how payroll services are performed. Employees themselves do their own payroll helping to eliminate errors. It’s proving so popular that two-thirds of Paycom’s customers have switched to Beti. Third-quarter revenue was up 22% year over year as customers realized they were saving money from “perfect” payrolls.\n\nThe one problem is that businesses are becoming so efficient and proficient at using Beti they are eliminating certain billable items. That’s hurting Payocm’s growth rate at the moment, and led to disappointing guidance for the rest of 2023 and 2024. However, it should make for satisfied customers who return again and again in the future.\n\nPaycom’s financial foundation remains solid and the modest dividend it initiated last year remains secure. There is plenty of room for future growth from the payout. Particularly as the market picks up steam, the cloud-based payroll company should thrive.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity specialist Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) enjoys the peace of mind that comes from knowing your business will always be needed. Data breaches were expected to hit a record last year and will likely continue being a menace going forward. Fortinet’s enterprise-class, service-provider and government-organization clients can also be at ease with its network security, cloud security, and endpoint security services. Its Security Fabric platform for example, enables customers to achieve higher levels of security, performance, and efficiency while reducing complexity and costs.\n\nAI is also expected to play a large role in protecting against cyber threats. Fortinet invested heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities to enhance its threat detection, prevention, and response solutions. It also staked out a leadership position in firewalls and software-defined wide area networks, or SD-WANs, that connect data centers to branches and the cloud.\n\nAs more customers shift their data and operations to the cloud, the need for security increases, not lessens. By expanding its product portfolio to meet customer demand, Fortinet can further increase its market share while revenue and profits grow.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) Deck of a Royal Caribbean (RCL) cruise ship looking over the ocean\n\nSource: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter nearly capsizing four years ago in the wake of the pandemic, Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) is back sailing the high seas. Shares more than doubled over the past year, far outstripping the returns of the index. Revenue is at record levels and the cruise line operator boasts occupancy rates comparable to pre-Covid levels despite prices rising.\n\nDespite this, Royal Caribbean trades at just 13 times earnings estimates and just 13 times free cash flow. It is more heavily indebted than it was before the global health crisis four years ago, but that was necessary to stay afloat. It is back to earning plenty of profit and generating cash flow to pay that down.\n\nThat’s not to say it might now encounter a rogue wave or two. The conflict in Israel will likely cause a small hit to its performance. The cruise line noted 1.5% of its fourth quarter capacity was to Israel. However, many of those voyages have been diverted elsewhere. The recent Red Sea attacks by Yemeni militants attacking ships could make travel there too dangerous as well. Commercial ships are already rerouting from the area. Cruise ports of call in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia may be off-limits. Even so, Royal Caribbean is still going full steam ahead and should keep sailing on.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is another cybersecurity specialist performing even better than Fortinet. Its stock is up 115% in the last 12 months. The industry is expected to grow from $156 billion in 2022 to $425 billion in 2030 for a near-14% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nThe cybersecurity leader’s fiscal year 2023 revenue soared 25% to $6.9 billion and turned in a $440 million profit. That’s a complete reversal from the year-ago period when it suffered losses of $267 million. It’s continuing that strong growth in fiscal 2024 with fourth quarter revenue up 20% while profits grew nearly 10-fold. Chairman and CEO ​​Nikesh Arora says the performance was driven by “An unprecedented level of attacks is fueling strong demand in the cybersecurity market.”\n\nIt is also investing in AI-powered solutions. Its Cortex platform now has 5,300 customers, a 25% increase in the quarter. It was also the only platform to achieve a 100% detection and protection in comprehensive industry evaluations called MITRE 5.\n\nBecause like death and taxes, cybercrime will always be with us, Palo Alto Networks will keep driving the bull market forward.\n\nModerna (MRNA) Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is currently best known for its Spikevax Covid therapeutic. But the biotech also delivers treatments for various other diseases, such as cancer and rare genetic disorders. While Covid shots are a much harder sell these days, Moderna has a 48% share of the U.S. market. It did have $6.7 billion worth of Covid product sales last year, however. Now it is preparing to launch another product, a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. There are nine other late-stage programs in development.\n\nThat gives Moderna the confidence to predict it will return to organic sales growth in 2025. It also expects to break even in 2026.  It says product launches and disciplined investment will help sales steadily grow going forward as it launches as many as 15 new products over the next five years. One of the more promising developments is its personalized cancer vaccine mRNA-4157, which it is collaborating with Merck (NYSE:MRK) on.\n\nModerna’s stock was a laggard in 2023 as Covid-related Spikevax sales collapsed 71%. As that’s it’s only commercial product on the market it’s not surprising the stock tumbled hard. Yet its RSV vaccine is moving towards commercialization in early 2024 and its other therapies are progressing through trials. The market is warming up to the stock once again. Expect Moderna to keep growing as more products hit the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Starbucks (SBUX) is expanding its international footprint, announcing plans to open 1,000 stores and double its workforce in India.\n\nYahoo Finance’s Seana Smith and Brad Smith discuss Starbucks's strategy as the stock hovers near a 52-week low.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Starbucks is accelerating its growth in India. The coffee chain planning to operate 1,000 stores by 2028, which is the equivalent of opening one new location every three days for the next four years in the country.\n\nDuring a visit this week, the Starbucks CEO saying India has become one of Starbucks fastest-growing markets in the world here, not the only brand to chart a course for India and make sure that they're also welcoming many of the consumer constituents into their locations.\n\nWe know that Apple has opened its first retail store there. And we'll see what Tesla does in the region as well. Elon Musk and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi have had recent meetings as well that could lead to even more development within that region. And we know that some of the job postings have actually already started to go up for Tesla, too.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly there's a real bet on the rising middle class in India. A number of companies, US-based companies seeing real opportunity for growth overseas. And it's interesting here that this announcement is coming at this time because we know Starbucks has been struggling here in the US.\n\nThere was a recent note out over the last several weeks from JP Morgan, the analyst there saying that, hey, maybe the Christmas promotions didn't stack up to what we saw play out in the fall. That could be a real risk here for the stock heading into the next quarterly earnings season.\n\nWhen you take a look at the performance of shares, even over the last year, the stock off just about 10%. So they're searching for growth, betting on India, betting on future success there with 1,000 store plans by 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo we'll see whether or not it really drives their business going forward. But again, shares have been under pressure. And you see it on that chart right there, the three month chart really falling since the end of November into the start of January.\n\nBRAD SMITH: A big tea culture. We were talking about that before. So we'll see how many of those consumers change their taste profiles as well. I don't know. Maybe some of the Unicorn Frappuccinos could do well over there. I don't know. We'll see what they--\n\nSEANA SMITH: I don't know. Starbucks is confident, though, that they're going to be able to convert a lot of those tea drinkers to coffee drinkers. So we'll see whether or not they are successful.",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 9, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, The Boeing Company BA and AT&T Inc. T.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Apple, UnitedHealth and Exxon Mobil\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple's shares have essentially moved sideways to down since July 2023, but they have performed roughly in-line with the Zacks Tech sector over the past year (+41.6% vs. +45.1%) and handily outperformed the broader market's +22% gain.\n\nThe company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone's year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nRevenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023's reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.\r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of UnitedHealth have outperformed the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+12.3% vs. +9.8%). The company's top line remains well-poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. The company's solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated in the $24.85-$25.00 band in 2023, the midpoint of which indicates a 12.3% rise from the 2022 figure. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments.\r\n\r\nHowever, membership in its global business continues to decline. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\r\n\r\nExxon Mobil shares have underperformed the Zacks Energy sector over the past year (-7.9% vs. -0.7%), but they have held up better than Chevron's -15.5% decline over the same time period. The energy giant's financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the coronavirus pandemic. Also, high input cost is hurting refining operations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. In the Stabroek Block, located offshore Guyana, ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook.\r\n\r\nThe advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe. ExxonMobil's deal to acquire Pioneer Natural will bolster its presence in the prolific Permian Basin.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Boeing Company and AT&T Inc..\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. introduced a new feature that mimics Apple Inc.’s AirPlay while working across different platforms, setting the stage for iPhone and Android users to wirelessly stream video to its TV hardware.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSEC’s X Account Hacked to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETF Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff Bottled Water Contains More Plastic Particles Than Previously Thought US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\n\nThe feature, called Matter Casting, is part of a push by Amazon to create interoperable services — an alternative to the propriety technology developed by Apple and Google. It will make it easier for iOS and Android phones to send video to Amazon devices, such as its Fire TV boxes and sticks, as well as the Echo Show 15 smart display.\n\nFor years, Apple’s AirPlay and Google’s Cast have offered this capability, letting users enjoy video from their phones on a large TV screen. But those systems don’t always work smoothly across platforms. Amazon also was at a disadvantage because it doesn’t have its own smartphone.\n\nThe new system — unveiled Tuesday at the CES conference in Las Vegas — will initially just send content from Amazon’s Prime Video app to Echo Show devices. Matter Casting will begin supporting Fire TV technology within “months,” the company said.\n\nBy later this year, the feature will work with a range of other video services, including Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, Starz and ZDF, Amazon said.\n\nApple and Google weren’t part of the Matter Casting announcement, but the three technology giants worked together on supporting the Matter standard for smart home appliances. That system allows an Apple user to, say, tap into smart home hardware designed for Amazon’s ecosystem.\n\nThe hope is to do the same for TV technology. Though Amazon previously allowed streaming from its video app to its hardware, it didn’t use the Matter system. With the new approach, Amazon sees the potential to make video-streaming apps and TV devices work seamlessly across the whole Apple, Google and Amazon lineups.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Comes Under a Microscope Private Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Is There Any Hope for Hollywood?

        "title": "If Apple Walks Away, What’s Left for Skyworks Stock?",
        "content": "Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), stock has long been seen as a cheap proxy for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), its largest customer. When sales are growing fast, analysts love to talk about Skyworks (which makes radio chips) getting away from that dependence. When growth is slow it hugs that dependence tight.\n\nFor SWKS stock, 2023 was a tough year. It had $685 million in sales to Apple, representing 64% of revenue. About 85% of those chips went into the iPhone. The question for investors is whether that other 36% of sales is worth worrying about.\n\nA Closer Look at SWKS Stock\n\nWhile Skyworks is a tech stock, you don’t buy it as one. You buy it for the dividend. That dividend jumped from 38 cents/share five years ago to 68 cents last November. If you are a long-term investor, that’s your return. Shares in January were just 23% ahead of where they were in early 2019. We’re talking about single digit annual returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSkyworks was much in vogue during the 2021 bull market. Shares traded at over $190 in the middle of that year, but you should have sold. It trades today closer to $105.\n\nThe highs were marked by public statements that Skyworks was going beyond Apple. You still see such stories, but analysts no longer pay attention to them.\n\nIn 2021 Skyworks bought Silicon Laboratories, hoping that chips for autos would reduce its Apple dependence. So far, they haven’t.\n\nWill Apple Leave?\n\nWhen they’re not fretting about Skyworks’ dependence on Apple, bears are worried about Apple walking away.\n\nApple has long focused on supplying its own silicon. Capturing those profits let it grow its bottom line without growth in unit sales. Its focus has mainly been on replacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). But with that work mostly complete it’s now going into its radio sets. This puts Skyworks in the crosshairs alongside Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nPersonally, I downplay those threats. The margins for Broadcom and Qualcomm are much bigger than the 47% Skyworks earns. Qualcomm and Apple have been in court for years. Broadcom is known for pushing its proprietary advantages hard.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll that, plus Skyworks’ relatively small size, a market cap of $16.5 billion, tells me Apple should drop it down the priority list.\n\nWhy Buy Skyworks?\n\nSkyworks stock is a big favorite among institutions, who have 84% of the common. Fundamentally, it’s safe, a good long-term holding\n\nFor the September quarter, Skyworks had GAAP operating income of $254 million, and earnings of $1.52 per share, on revenue of $1.22 billion. For the December quarter, it expects similar results, making the 68 cent per share dividend safe.\n\nWhat most excited investors last year was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, up 76% from a year ago. CEO Liam Griffin emphasized design wins for Android 5G phones and WiFi 7 base stations.\n\nIt was enough to keep analysts on-side. There are currently 24 of them, with 9 saying buy it and 2 saying sell.\n\nThe Bottom Line on SWKS Stock\n\nNowhere in that quarterly release does Griffin mention AI. That’s interesting because much of Skyworks’ non-Apple growth should come from client devices. Medical devices, wearables, factory robotics, and autos are all subject to AI hype.\n\nWhile most reporters focus on AI writing stories like this one, growth today is coming from managing fleets of client devices in hospitals, factories and on battlefields. What I call the “Machine Internet” can orchestrate the work of entire institutions, software doing things people have never been capable of.\n\nThe fact that Skyworks analysts remain focused on the iPhone is telling. If AI isn’t growing in areas where it should grow, might the whole hype machine go off the rails? SWKS stock may not just be a proxy for Apple’s problems, but for AI’s as well.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in INTC, QCOM and AAPL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A Chinese state-backed institution has devised a way to identify users who send messages via Apple Inc.’s popular AirDrop feature, Beijing’s government claims, as part of broader efforts to root out undesirable content.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIPhone Survives 16,000-Foot Fall, Helps Steer Jet-Panel Hunt Chinese Billionaire Is Second-Biggest Foreign Owner of US Land Musk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Boeing Slumps After Panel Blowout Leads to Partial 737 Grounding US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\n\nThe Beijing institute developed the technique to crack an iPhone’s encrypted device log to identify the numbers and emails of senders who share AirDrop content, the city’s judicial bureau said in an online post. Police have identified multiple suspects via that method, the agency said, without disclosing if anyone was arrested.\n\n“It improves the efficiency and accuracy of case-solving and prevents the spread of inappropriate remarks as well as potential bad influences,” the bureau said.\n\nThe declaration again drew attention to an iPhone feature that activists around the world have employed to spread their message. Requiring just a nearby bluetooth connection, it was widely used by protesters to share pro-democracy slogans during 2019 protests in Hong Kong. An Apple representative didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nHailed by the article as a “technological breakthrough,” the method could supplement measures intended to eradicate information China deems unhealthy. It also adds more uncertainty to Apple’s operations in a country where it already grapples with severe constraints on content, including on Apple TV and Books.\n\nAirDrop allows the quick exchange of files like images, documents or videos between Apple devices. The company has limited the feature on Chinese iPhones since 2022, after the service was used by protesters to spread images to fellow device owners.\n\nThe American electronics leader also faces mounting sales pressure, after a growing number of state-backed agencies banned the use of foreign devices at work.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: China’s iPhone Ban Accelerates Across Agencies, State Firms\n\n(Updates with a line on how AirDrop works.

        "content": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\n\nThe production of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones in India has reached a groundbreaking level, exceeding INR 1 trillion ($13.5 billion) last year. According to data, obtained by the Indian daily Economic Times, iPhones valued at INR 650 billion ($8.8 billion) were exported from January to December.\n\nAn insider with knowledge of the production process explained, \"The [INR 1 trillion] figure denotes the freight on board (FOB) value as the products leave the factory. After factoring in taxes and dealer margins in various countries, the market value could range from INR 1.5 trillion ($20.3 billion) to INR 1.7 trillion ($23 billion).\"\n\nSee Also: Fresh Layoffs Incoming At Flipkart? Walmart May Have To Play Saviour\n\nFOB refers to the cost of the goods as they depart the factory, excluding taxes and other charges. Apple's impressive performance has surpassed the targets set under India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, possibly earning the company's contract manufacturers additional rewards according to the scheme's financial provisions.\n\nThis milestone highlights the Indian government's efforts to shift global supply chains from China to India.\n\nApple has notably become one of India's leading mobile phone manufacturers by market value. The technology juggernaut has boosted its market share in India from 2% in FY18 to 6% in FY23, as reported by Counterpoint. During this period, Apple’s revenues in India soared to INR 493.22 billion ($6.7 billion) from INR 130.97 billion ($1.8 billion). In contrast, despite a decrease in market share, Samsung's mobile revenues grew to INR 703 billion ($9.5 billion) from INR 373 billion ($5 billion).\n\nApple is also nurturing a strong network of Indian suppliers, such as a unit of the Tata Group, further strengthening its shift away from China.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next: Is Sony Pulling Out Of The $10B Mega Merger With Zee Entertainment?\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple's iPhone Production In India Hits Historic $13.5B Milestone, Surpassing Targets originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter operating profit likely fell by about 35%, as a sluggish recovery in demand for the firm’s key memory and smartphone chips dented revenue.\n\nSamsung’s operating profit in the three months to Dec 31 likely fell to 2.8 trillion won ($2.1 billion) from 3.7 trillion won a year ago. Revenue fell to 67.40 trillion won from 70.46 trillion won a year ago, while also missing Investing.com estimates of 70.1 trillion won.\n\nThe South Korean conglomerate will release a full earnings report on Jan 31.\n\nBut Tuesday’s results show that the company is still grappling with a sharp slowdown in chip demand over the past two years. A bulk of this was driven by slowing demand for consumer electronics, as rising interest rates and high inflation across most of the globe saw consumers drastically scale back discretionary spending on electronics.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), for instance, which is a key buyer of memory chips, processors and smartphone displays from Samsung, saw its iPhone sales in China decline for the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nWeakening iPhone sales are likely to herald a similar trend for Samsung’s own smartphone offerings, the Galaxy and foldables ranges.\n\nCorporate investment in tech infrastructure slowed substantially over the past two years, which in turn dented demand for memory chips used in network infrastructure.\n\nThe weak earnings also indicated that an artificial intelligence-driven rebound in demand for chips remained weak. The firm had in late-2023 forecast an eventual pick-up in demand on the back of increased interest in AI, which has greatly benefited peers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nBut while Nvidia makes specialized chips for running the large language models powering programs such as ChatGPT, Samsung faces stiff competition from rivals such as SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) and U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) in selling high-density memory chips, which are geared towards AI development.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "content": "Apple on Monday said its Vision Pro augmented reality headset will hit the U.S. market on Feb. 2.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro, first unveiled last summer, will come with a starting price tag of $3,499, according to the tech giant.\n\nApple said it will start pre-orders for the device on Jan. 19 ahead of its February debut. When the Vision Pro launches, Apple’s physical U.S. locations and online store will carry it.\n\nCEO Tim Cook touted it as the \"most advanced consumer electronics device ever created\" and said the \"era of spatial computing has arrived.\"\n\nThe Vision Pro \"blends digital content with the physical world and unlocks powerful spatial experiences in visionOS, controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible – a user’s eyes, hands, and voice,\" the tech giant said.\n\nAPPLE'S IOS 17.2 BRINGS JOURNALING-FOCUSED IPHONE APP AND OTHER FEATURES\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nWhen wearing the headset, users can have a slew of apps displayed next to each other, something Apple said could help boost productivity.\n\nUsers can use the Vision Pro for entertainment purposes as well.\n\nSEC SIDES WITH ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDERS IN FIGHT WITH APPLE OVER FREE-SPEECH RESOLUTION\n\nNumerous existing games have compatibility with the headset on top of new \"spatial games\" that Apple said will specifically utilize the technology. For movies and television, the company said users would feel like they’re viewing the selection of Apple TV+, Disney+, Max and other available content for Vision Pro on a \"100 feet wide\" screen.\n\n\"Where a user looks stays private while navigating Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites,\" Apple said.\n\nIt will offer Optic ID, which relies on the user’s iris, for security like locking and unlocking the device.\n\nCustomers will also get both a solo knit band and a dual loop band for wearing their headsets, according to Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nAPPLE WINS APPEAL TO TEMPORARILY PAUSE APPLE WATCH BAN\n\nThe Vision Pro will become the latest device that the company has rolled out in the U.S. in recent months.\n\nIt launched its slate of iPhone 15s, with prices ranging from $799 to $1,199 depending on the model, and its Apple Watch Series 9 in mid-September. In October, it unveiled new iterations of its iMac and MacBook Pro.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple Vision Pro headset: Launch date, pricing unveiled",

        "title": "Apple's Vision Pro headset launches next month as company seeks to expand mixed-reality market",
        "content": "Apple's high-priced headset for toggling between the real and digital world will be available in its stores beginning Feb. 2, launching the trendsetting company's push to broaden the appeal of what so far has been a niche technology.\n\nApple unveiled the sleek $3,500 goggles at a software conference held at its Cupertino, California, headquarters eight months ago — an event that was designed to encourage developers to make apps tailored for a device that projects users into three-dimensional simulations of reality.\n\nApple's announcement coincides with a major consumer electronics show in Las Vegas where the company has long been conspicuously absent.\n\nApple says the goggles' operating system will be compatible with more than 1 million apps designed for the iPhone and iPad. Pre-orders begin Jan. 19, but buyers will have to go to a store to be properly fitted for the goggles, which are controlled with the eyes and a few simple hand gestures.\n\nAlthough Facebook owner Meta Platforms and other companies have been making virtual reality headsets for years with limited success, many industry analysts believe Apple has the potential to expand the technology's audience beyond the video gamers and mostly tech nerds that have embraced it so far.\n\nThe Vision Pro already has gotten largely enthusiastic reviews among the media who were able to test it in tightly controlled demonstrations monitored by Apple, but the device's price tag probably means relatively few unit sales during its first year on the market.\n\nEven so, Apple's first new product since its smartwatch debut a decade ago could set the stage for the introduction of more affordable versions for a broader audience. Right now, the Vision Pro will cost seven times more than Meta's latest virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3.\n\nIn a sign that Apple is expecting the Vision Pro to pave the way to a bigger market, the company included the ability to take 3-D videos that can be viewed through the goggles on its its latest premium iPhones, the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. These videos are so realistic that the people and other images in them appear to be right in front of the viewer watching them.\n\nApple is looking for ways to juice its sales after suffering a slight decline in revenue during its last fiscal year ending in in September. Apple still raked in $383 billion in sales, with the iPhone accounting for more than half that amount.",

        "content": "Thursday, January 4, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple’s shares have essentially moved sideways to down since July 2023, but they have performed roughly in-line with the Zacks Tech sector over the past year (+41.6% vs. +45.1%) and handily outperformed the broader market's +22% gain.\n\nThe company is benefiting from strong demand for iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nRevenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023’s reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.\r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of UnitedHealth have outperformed the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+12.3% vs. +9.8%). The company’s top line remains well-poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. The company’s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated in the $24.85-$25.00 band in 2023, the midpoint of which indicates a 12.3% rise from the 2022 figure. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments.\r\n\r\nHowever, membership in its global business continues to decline. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\r\n\r\nExxon Mobil shares have underperformed the Zacks Energy sector over the past year (-7.9% vs. -0.7%), but they have held up better than Chevron's -15.5% decline over the same time period.  The energy giant’s financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the coronavirus pandemic. Also, high input cost is hurting refining operations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. In Stabroek Block, located offshore Guyana, ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook.\r\n\r\nThe advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe. ExxonMobil’s deal to acquire Pioneer Natural will bolster its presence in the prolific Permian Basin.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Amgen Inc. (AMGN), The Boeing Company (BA) and AT&T Inc. (T).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple has challenged EU tech rules designating its five App Stores as a single core platform service subject to onerous obligations, saying that EU regulators have misinterpreted and misapplied the new legislation that took effect last May.\n\nThe company also disputed the characterisation of its operating system iOS as an important gateway for business users to reach end users and the interoperability obligation that goes with that label.\n\nThe iPhone maker challenged the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in November last year but did not provide details.\n\nThe European Commission made \"material factual errors, in concluding that the applicant's five App Stores are a single core platform service,\" Apple said in its plea to the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest.\n\nThe company in its argument to the EU competition enforcer said it operates five App Stores on iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, Apple TVs and Apple Watches, with each designed to distribute apps for a specific operating system and Apple device.\n\nDMA requirements that would affect Apple include allowing third parties to inter-operate with its own services and letting business users promote their offers and conclude contracts with their customers outside its platform.\n\nApple's lawsuit also took issue with the Commission's designation of its messaging service iMessage as a number-independent interpersonal communications service (NIICS) that prompted an EU investigation into whether it should comply with DMA rules.\n\nThe company contends that iMessage is not a NIICS as it is not a fee-based service and it does not monetise it via the sale of hardware devices nor via the processing of personal data.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Andrew Heavens)",

        "title": "Apple to launch Vision Pro headset in US on Feb. 2",
        "content": "Following two analyst downgrades on Apple (AAPL) stock last week, bullish sentiments on the iPhone maker is lagging behind that of its Magnificent Seven counterparts.\n\nAfter facing various challenges on the tail-end of 2023 — including a domestic ban on Apple Watch models and waning iPhone demand in China — the tech giant is coming out swinging in 2024. Apple is set to launch its Vision Pro mixed reality headset in the US on February 2 with pre-orders starting January 19.\n\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Dan Howley breaks down the announcement.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, Apple's Vision Pro augmented reality headset will be available in the US starting February 2 for more than triple the price of Meta's most expensive headset. Now, will this device give the tech giant the comeback it needs? To break this down for us, Yahoo Finance reporter Dan Howley is here.\n\nDan, I know we've been waiting for this one. So what are your thoughts here?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, Rachelle, this is a big announcement coming on Groundhogs Day. I just think that's a funny time for it to launch. It'll be $3,499 when it hits the market February 2. Preorders start January 19 at 8:00 AM Eastern, that's 5:00 AM Pacific time for people who have $3,400 to-- or $3,500 to go out and spend right away.\n\nAnd, you know, just a few other kind of points to mention. The base storage for this is going to be 256 gigabytes. So you'll have, you know, enough on there for photos, things along those lines. There's going to be a pair of readers in there, so, like, reader lenses. They're going to be $99 extra if you need those.\n\nAnd then if you need prescription optics, those are coming from Zeiss, and they're going to be $149. So that's an addition to the $3,500 that you would spend on the headset itself. You would get these prescription lenses. You would go into an Apple store. They would kind of have you set up.\n\nStory continues\n\nYeah, I had previously tried these back in June at the WWDC event. You use the kind of FaceTime camera on your iPhone to look at your eyes, take measurements of your face. And that's kind of how you figure out the kind of light block that you're going to need that goes around your eyes and ensures that you're basically sealed off from the rest of the world.\n\nSo there's a lot that goes into this. It's not just walking in and picking up an iPhone or even, you know, trying out a pair of AirPods to see if you like them in-store or not, something you can do, by the way. This is going to be a very delicate kind of setup process for Apple.\n\nThe fact that they're offering online and in-store at the same time is really interesting. But, you know, for Apple overall, this is their first major product category that they're getting into since the Apple Watch. So this is a long time coming. It's still an unproven market.\n\nThe smartphone market globally sells billions of devices a year. The headset market sells millions. So a huge difference in the amount of demand. We have to see if Apple then can ramp those numbers up. But $3,500, it's a lot to ask.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. But chatting with some of the Yahoo Finance crew here, we're seeing at least they're thinking of those of us who have eye issues who need to wear glasses or contact lenses. But that price tag, yeah, that's hefty, but, I mean, it looks cool. The cool factor is tough, especially if you want to be an early adopter. Appreciate you always giving us the latest. Yahoo Finance reporter Dan Howley, thanks so much.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s first major new product in nine years arrives on Feb. 2, setting the stage for what the company hopes is a new era after the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Boeing Slumps After Panel Blowout Leads to Partial 737 Grounding China Says It Caught Foreign Consultant Spying for UK’s MI6\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro — a $3,499 mixed-reality headset — goes on sale in the US on that day, according to a statement Monday. It will be available to preorder on the company’s website starting at 5 a.m. California time on Jan. 19, Apple said in the announcement, which came just ahead of the CES technology conference in Las Vegas.\n\nThe device melds virtual and augmented reality — an experience Apple calls spatial computing. It’s designed for more immersive FaceTime chats, gaming, video and productivity apps. The Vision Pro, first unveiled in June, marks the first new hardware category for Apple since the company introduced its smartwatch in 2015.\n\n“The era of spatial computing has arrived,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in the statement. “Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create and explore.”\n\nThe new product vaults Apple into competition with Meta Platforms Inc. and other makers of augmented and virtual reality headsets. Apple’s device is far pricier than rival models, but includes higher-end features like dual 4K displays and Mac-grade processors.\n\nBloomberg News first reported that the device would launch by February. Apple will push users to buy the product at Apple retail stores since it requires a precise fitting for proper operation. The company also said Monday that it would charge $99 and $150 for prescription lens inserts.\n\nThis week, Apple is hosting hundreds of retail store employees at its headquarters to train them on how to use and sell the device.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Can Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump’s?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable.\n\nTechnology stocks, especially the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, absolutely rocked in 2023 thanks to the AI-fueled rally. While the enthusiasm around AI is just getting started, many analysts believe in 2024 the broader market gains enjoyed by tech stocks last year will expand to other sectors while mega-cap tech stocks will take a back seat. Delano Saporu, Founder and CEO of New Street Advisors Group, while talking to CNBC earlier this month said that Magnificent Seven stocks are expected to take a breather in 2024 while market gains will broaden out to other sectors.\n\nRecently, Jim Cramer also talked about his forecasts for 2024 and said that there is a market rotation going on right now in which money managers are taking profits by selling major technology stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and investing this money into other sectors like financials, healthcare and small-cap companies which remained on the back burner in 2023.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, also thinks that Magnificent Seven stocks are not expected to always outperform and investors should look beyond these stocks in 2024. Discussing his portfolio performance on CNBC, Katz said over the past two years Magnificent Seven stocks on average are up just about 8%. He said that for 2024 he’s expecting the laggards of 2023 to “catch up.”\n\nIn this backdrop, it’s important to take a look at some of the top non-tech stocks that have been posting high revenue growth over the past few months and years. High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify profitable non-tech companies with about 20%+ quarter-over-quarter revenue growth recently and over 20% revenue growth over the past five years. From these companies we selected 17 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n17. Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 11\n\nCanadian banking company Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) is a stock with decent revenue growth over the past few years.\n\nIn November, Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) posted Q4 results. Revenue in the period jumped 8.9% year over year.\n\n16. HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nWith 38 hedge funds having stakes in it, Indian banking company HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB) ranks 16th  in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.\n\nRecently, UBS published its list of top global stock picks for 2024. HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB) made it to the list. UBS said lower rates and “resilient earnings” are expected to help global equities in 2024.\n\n15. Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nTexas-based Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) is one of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 39 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW). The most significant stakeholder of Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) during this period was Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management which owns an $82 million stake in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW).\n\nMany analysts believe small- and mid-cap stocks like TDW are headed for a rebound in 2024 while mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will take a breather.\n\nThird Avenue Small-Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Finally, long-time holding, offshore oil services company, Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) rose 31% in the quarter, as more investors and operators recognized the importance of investing in fossil fuels to sustain long-term economic growth and national security. In a challenging environment for most asset classes, Energy was a considerable outperformer this past quarter, illustrating the potency of the investor pivot.”\n\n14. Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nEntertainment company Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) shares have gained about 23% over the past six months. In December, Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) received several upgrades and bullish comments from Wall Street firms. Among the Wall Street firms bullish on the stock is Morgan Stanley, whose analyst Cameron Mansson-Perrone said the stock’s valuation is attractive. The analyst said Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) has lagged the market by 2,000 basis points since the end of 2021 despite return on capital improvements.\n\nA total of 40 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) as of the end of the September quarter.\n\nBaron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Liberty Media Corporation-Liberty Live is a tracking stock created on 8/4/2023 representing Liberty Media Corporation’s holdings in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”\n\n13. Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nInsurance company Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR) ranks 13th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors. In November Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $8.33, beating estimates by $2.21. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 42.6% year over year to $1.84 million, beating estimates by $40 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR).\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR), a provider of reinsurance and insurance products, surged ahead by 6%. Its second quarter numbers were solid across underwriting, property catastrophe premiums, investment income, and fee income. While there was an impact from severe storms during the quarter, RenRe’s losses were modest.”\n\n12. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nIn December, Goldman Sachs published a list of high-growth stocks that it believes have attractive valuations. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) made it to this list.\n\nA total of 41 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) as of the end of the September quarter. The most significant stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) is owned by D. E. Shaw’s D E Shaw which owns a $443 million stake.\n\nAriel Fund made the following comment about Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Several stocks in the portfolio had strong returns over the period. Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), was one of the top 3 performers in the S&P 500 during the quarter. Shares surged following a significant top- and bottom-line earnings beat, as stronger than anticipated consumer demand is driving a record WAVE season. Forward booking trends are also ahead of historical ranges at record pricing. These factors combined with further improvement in onboard spend and solid cost containment led management to increase RCL’s full-year 2023 guidance. We believe the revised revenue and earnings outlook lays the foundation for RCL to exceed its’ three-year strategic imperative, the Trifecta Program.”\n\n11. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nInsulin delivery systems company Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) 11th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.

Revenue in the period jumped 27% year over year to $432.7 million, beating estimates by $18.5 million.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”\n\n10. Lantheus Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LNTH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nHealthcare company Lantheus Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LNTH) ranks 10th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:LNTH) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also made an investment in Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNTH), which offers a portfolio of diagnostic health care products, primarily serving the complex nuclear imaging market. The company also has a pipeline of disruptive nuclear therapeutics (radiopharmaceuticals), creating a unique combination of strong profitability and cash flow generation with attractive growth opportunities in pipeline and existing products. The operational and logistical challenges of operating in nuclear medicine provide Lantheus a durable moat in this emerging therapeutic market.”\n\n9. Everest Group Ltd (NYSE:EG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nManagement consulting company Everest Group Ltd (NYSE:EG) was one of the stocks in the list of high-growth stocks trading at attractive valuations published by Goldman Sachs’ U.S. Weekly Kickstart in December.  Goldman Sachs said these stocks are suitable for those looking for high growth but are “wary” of valuations.\n\n8. First Citizens BancShares Inc (Delaware) Class A (NASDAQ:FCNCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nFirst Citizens BancShares Inc’s (Delaware) Class A (NASDAQ:FCNCA) revenue in the third quarter increased by a whopping 111% on a YoY basis.

(NASDAQ:FCNCA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s largest position is First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) (“First Citizens” or “FCNCA”). We acquired our stake over the past three years. Initially, we owned and traded around a small position in CIT Group Inc. (“CIT”) during the summer of 2020. We felt CIT was undervalued and management was making progress in reducing risk during the Covid-19 pandemic. In late 2020, CIT agreed to be acquired by First Citizens. We added to our CIT stake the morning of the acquisition announcement because we thought the acquisition was so financially attractive that First Citizens’ shares would rally and pull CIT’s shares higher. Our CIT shares were exchanged for First Citizens shares when the merger completed. We held onto our First Citizens shares because we admired the management team, we felt the bank was undervalued, and we projected the bank would benefit from higher interest rates. Then, earlier this year, First Citizens was the winning bidder in the FDIC’s auction of the failed Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). We added significantly to the Fund’s First Citizens position on the following Monday morning because the deal was unbelievably favorable for First Citizens.\n\nFirst Citizens’s stock price rose more than 50% that day and has risen another 40% in the months since the SVB acquisition. We have not sold any shares. We believe the stock still has the potential to double over the next three years. Despite this attractive upside, we think the downside is minimal. Our downside scenario is an unchanged stock price in three years…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:IBKR).\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. Their company’s second quarter net interest income came in better than expected while revenues were slightly ahead. Earnings, however, fell short of sell-side projections due to a one-time legal reserve. The market looked past this blemish as its stock price gained 4%.”\n\n6. Heico Corp (NYSE:HEI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nAerospace and electronics company Heico Corp (NYSE:HEI) shares have gained about 10% over the past one year.

Alphabet’s shares have gained 54.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 45.1%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.7% in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nAlphabet's growing Chromebook updates are expected to strengthen its competitive edge against rivals like Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT, which are also making strong efforts to enhance their notebook and laptop offerings.\r\n\r\nApple introduced M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max, three personal computer chips featuring advanced 3-nanometer process technology, enhancing performance and capabilities for Mac, showcasing Apple's significant advancements since the M1 family's debut.\r\n\r\nApple also unveiled the macOS Sonoma update for compatible Macs, which features several improvements over its predecessor, Venture. This free software update brings new features like desktop widgets, screen savers, video conferencing, Safari and optimized gaming, enhancing the Mac experience.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft unveiled the Surface Laptop Go 3, a 2-in-1 portable laptop featuring a 12th-Gen Alder Lake mobile architecture for efficient multi-tasking, running on the Intel Core i5-1235U with 10 cores and 12 threads configuration.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s launch of Surface Laptop Studio 2, the first Microsoft laptop with a dedicated VPU AI accelerator, offering Windows 11 Copilot functionality, expanded port selection and high battery life, remains noteworthy.\n\nZacks Rank & Another Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nAnother top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Camtek CAMT, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "title": "Amazon Has Wall Street Seeing Return to Record Stock Price",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Amazon.com Inc. shares are poised to resume their gains after a rough start to 2024, putting the stock on track for a long-awaited return to record high levels posted more than two years ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Key Piece of Boeing 737 Found in Hunt for Clues on Blowout China Says It Caught Foreign Consultant Spying for UK’s MI6\n\nThat, at least, is the view among analysts, with some 97% of those tracked by Bloomberg recommending the cloud-computing and e-commerce giant’s shares. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are among firms naming it their top e-commerce or internet stock for 2024, while Oppenheimer and Roth MKM crowned it their favorite large-cap choice.\n\nIt’s the kind of bullish consensus that might raise alarm bells for some contrarians, especially after the shares surged 81% last year, the most since 2015. The stock was among the hardest hit of the big tech firms in last week’s declines, although it fared better than Apple Inc.\n\nConfidence is high in Amazon’s profit outlook, partly because of AI tailwinds. The average analyst price target suggests upside of roughly 25%, which would return Amazon close to its all-time closing high from July 2021. Among megacaps, only Nvidia Corp. boasts a better return potential, as the Street sees it.\n\n“I think this year you’ll get Amazon breaching its previous high,” said Andrew Slimmon, who holds the shares in portfolios he oversees at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “The stock is not expensive relative to its history, it is beating numbers, and consensus estimates are rising. That’s a recipe for a bull market.”\n\nAmazon has gone the longest among the so-called Magnificent Seven without posting a record, in contrast to Apple, Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia, all of which set new highs last year. The seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 Index by market value — a group that also includes Google parent Alphabet Inc., Tesla Inc. and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc., have mostly faltered in January, after driving the market’s strength last year. Amazon’s 3.3% drop is among the steepest of the group.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Magnificent Seven Loses Importance as Soft Landing Means Risk On\n\nAnalysts recommend Amazon for a slew of reasons, but most cite better growth trends and improving margins, especially as the company reaps the benefit from investments it made during the pandemic. Artificial intelligence is also expected to lift demand for its cloud business.\n\nConsensus expectations for Amazon’s net 2024 earnings have risen 18% over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, even as the view for revenue has held flat. Amazon’s most recent results, in October, showed robust growth in both earnings and sales, in particular its cloud business.\n\nValuation Appeal\n\nThe improving profit picture has helped boost Amazon’s appeal on a valuation basis. The stock trades at 32 times estimated earnings, and while that’s above the multiple of 23.9 for the Nasdaq 100 Index, it’s well below Amazon’s 10-year average of 57.\n\nNeedham & Co. touted valuation as a selling point. The firm named Amazon its second-favorite — after Alphabet — for 2024 among the former FAANG group of companies, which also include Meta, Apple and Netflix Inc.\n\nIts analysis “concludes that investors are getting AMZN’s core e-commerce business for free,” analyst Laura Martin wrote last month.\n\nAmazon is a perennial top pick for analysts. Goldman Sachs, Mizuho Securities, and Wells Fargo & Co. all named it as such at various points in 2023. While those bulls have been rewarded over the long-term, buy ratings don’t necessarily translate into superior performance: Amazon’s roughly 80% gain over the past five years compares with a 150% advance in the Nasdaq 100 for the same period.\n\nAndrew Huang, a portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management, is among those expecting improving margins and cloud demand to support the stock in 2024, while a low valuation relative to its history diminishes downside risk.\n\nHowever, he said, the near-unanimous bullishness could be a contrarian indicator.\n\n“If everyone is expecting another good year after last year’s rally, that could mean it is a time to trim your position, because the stock could take a hit on even a slight disappointment,” he said.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple shares have dropped about 6% to start the year, with a pair of analyst downgrades underlining concerns about the strength of the company’s key iPhone business. Both Piper Sandler and Barclays lowered their view on the stock, resulting in a consensus rating — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell views on the stock — of 4.04 out of five, the lowest for the stock since October 2020.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple’s iPhone sales slump in China is deepening and the company is likely to see volumes decline further this year, according to Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee. Elon Musk’s drug use has worried executives and board members at businesses he runs, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the billionaire and the companies. Samsung Electronics Co. likely managed to stem revenue and operating profit slides during the fourth quarter, affirming expectations that chip and electronics demand will gradually recover in 2024. Global technology giants including Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft are among firms working to ramp up their presence in Saudi Arabia amid pressure from the government, which has said it will stop giving contracts to companies without regional headquarters in the country. Meituan has become Hong Kong’s second-largest food delivery platform since debuting in the city last May, a sign that splashy subsidies are boosting the company’s first major foray outside mainland China.\n\n(Updates shares in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump’s?

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 6.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share, indicating a change of +10.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $117.31 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $393.42 billion and $418.55 billion estimates indicate +2.5% and +6.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $89.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.7%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.29 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.57%. The EPS surprise was +5.04%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Apple surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why I Sold Some Apple Stock to End 2023 and Where I'm Investing Instead",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks prized for growth and earnings stability, helped propel the overall stock market back toward all-time highs in 2023.\n\nApple's performance was rock solid despite higher interest rates and a resulting weakening of global consumer spending. When accounting for reinvested dividends, Apple stock's total return was an incredible 45% in 2023.\n\nThough I favor making small, gradual portfolio changes over time, I decided to sell some Apple stock near the end of 2023. Here's why and where I invested instead.\n\nThe most \"expensive\" magnificent seven stock?\n\nThrough thick and thin, I've owned Apple for many years. 2023 was an interesting year. Despite being part of the vaunted group of Magnificent Seven tech giants (thanks to the aforementioned stock price outperformance), it was actually far from a perfect year for Apple.\n\nThe iPhone remains far and away the flagship product, accounting for 52% of the company's $383 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended in September). But as I wrote in November, even iPhone sales fell slightly. Paired with a steep drop in the PC (primarily the MacBook for Apple) and other consumer electronics markets (e.g., iPad, Watch, AirPods, Beats), not even the ongoing growth in Services was enough to keep Apple revenue on the rise.\n\nApple was able to offset this weakness with ample share repurchases. It repurchased and retired $77.6 billion worth of stock, effectively reducing its share count by 3% last year and boosting earnings per share for shareholders.\n\nThat was a great strategy for investors during the bear market over the last couple of years, and my over-allocation to Apple helped keep my portfolio afloat. However, slow growth and stock buybacks may not be the best strategies if you believe (as I do) a new bull market might be in the early innings.\n\nApple stock looks expensive, given the sluggish earnings growth expected for 2024. In fact, of all the Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple has the lowest long-term earnings growth rate (9% expected), yet trades for a premium 28 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for next year's earnings.\n\nStory continues AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis is why I sold some Apple to redeploy the proceeds elsewhere. That said, I still have plenty of Apple stock. That now comes primarily via my old index fund investments in Vanguard Growth ETF (of which Apple is about 13% of the portfolio), Vanguard Information Technology ETF (22% of the portfolio), and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (nearly 50% of Berkshire's publicly traded stock holdings).\n\nNevertheless, with Apple maturing into a slower-growth business, and given that I have decades left before I need my investment dollars, I felt it necessary to trim and rebalance.\n\nWhere I'm investing my Apple winnings\n\nWhen looking for a replacement for my portfolio rebalance, I started with the Magnificent Seven themselves. I already purchased additional Alphabet last year. However, the other two parts of the big digital advertising market -- Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- still look attractively priced for an expected rally in earnings in 2024. I've been building up a larger position in Amazon as it figures out how better to monetize its massive e-commerce and digital consumer empire. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAfter an epic year for the buildout of generative AI infrastructure (mostly to Nvidia's gain), I think beaten-up software stocks could benefit in 2024 as all that newly installed AI hardware starts to get monetized. I added to a longtime position in Salesforce(NYSE: CRM) again and am looking to finally start buying ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW) sometime this year. Other cloud computing stocks look compelling for the new year as well.\n\nAnd, of course, I still like semiconductor stocks, too, especially if the iPhone and other consumer electronic sales notch a rebound in 2024.\n\nTo be clear, Apple looks like it has all the ingredients to continue as a great long-term investment. Growth may be more moderate than in times past, but the tech titan is highly profitable and doles out ample cash to shareholders. I'm happy to continue holding, but a high valuation compared to some other tech stocks makes me think there are better growth opportunities available right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

And to help the user stay connected to the people around them, Apple designed a groundbreaking new feature called EyeSight™. When a person approaches someone wearing Vision Pro, the device looks transparent — letting the user see them while also displaying the user’s eyes. When a user is immersed in an Environment or using an app, EyeSight gives visual cues to others about what the user is focused on.\n\nThe breakthrough display, advanced audio experiences, high-performance eye tracking system, and more are powered by Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design. The M2 chip delivers powerful standalone performance, while the brand-new R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user’s eyes.\n\nPrivacy and Security at Its Core\n\nApple Vision Pro offers industry-leading privacy and security. Optic ID™ is a new authentication system that analyzes a user’s iris to unlock Vision Pro, autofill passwords, and complete payments with Apple Pay®. Where a user looks stays private while navigating Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.\n\nAccessibility in visionOS\n\nAs with all Apple products, powerful accessibility features have been built right into visionOS. Key accessibility features like VoiceOver, Zoom, Switch Control, Guided Access®, and more have been reimagined for spatial computing. Users can interact with Apple Vision Pro entirely with their eyes, hands, or voice, or any combination that works best for them. They can select a preferred input method such as their eyes, finger, or wrist using Pointer Control, pause on an element of visionOS for a few seconds to simulate a tap using Dwell Control, or simply use voice commands for activities across Vision Pro using Voice Control. If input from both eyes is not an option, visionOS also allows eye tracking with one dominant eye.\n\nApple Vision Pro and the Environment\n\nApple Vision Pro is designed with the environment in mind, with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled tin soldering and gold plating in multiple printed circuit boards. The frame and battery enclosure contain 100 percent recycled aluminum, and the Light Seal and Solo Knit Band are each made with over 70 percent recycled yarn. Vision Pro meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, PVC, and beryllium. The packaging is 100 percent fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of eliminating plastics in all packaging by 2025.\n\nToday, Apple is carbon neutral for its global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nApple Vision Pro will be available starting at $3,499 (U.S.) with 256GB of storage.

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the 13 most advanced countries in electronics. You can skip our detailed analysis of the electronics industry and go directly to the 5 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics.\n\nLiving in a technological era, we are constantly surrounded by one or the other form of electronics. Most of us carry one or another form of electronics everywhere we go, short of bushcrafting in the woods, but you'll most likely still take your phone along there too. All these instruments, including smartphones, smart watches, airpods, tabs and PCs, along with others, are the various types of electronics without which, civilization, as we know it, would not exist.\n\nFurthermore, the industry of electronics is continuously evolving and bringing to the forefront innovative products aimed at facilitating a more efficient lifestyle. For the year 2024, it is expected that the electronics industry would show a trend towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well as organic electronics, apart from many more. We have already emphasized the far-reaching role of specialized chips for this sector in the article 12 most advanced countries in electronics. Here we present to you the significance of organic electronics and AI in general.\n\nOrganic Electronics\n\nThe rising global warming and climatic disruption witnessed by the world has encouraged a more environmental friendly attitude. The electronics industry is no different. In an attempt to play their part, sustainable and eco-friendly devices are not only becoming their priority but have also been forecasted as the future of electronics industry. As a means of producing next-generation electronic devices, organic electronics are poised for an accelerated future growth. The global organic electronics market is expected to generate $178.25 billion by 2028.\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) shows full commitment towards sustainability and green initiatives. Cisco Takeback and Reuse, for one, is an effort to support circular economy by efficiently managing end-of-life of returned equipment and enhancing recycling and reuse rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithin this field of organic electronics, OLED technologies are expected to shine the most. Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ: OLED), collaborating with PPG, have recently opened an OLED site- organic light emitting diode- in Shannon, Ireland. This will not only give a boost to the global organic market but to make a substantial contribution to the sustainability agenda of the electronics industry.\n\nSimilarly, LG Display (NYSE: LPL) is also in the running for using organic electronics to produce more efficient and user- friendly devices. Their third generation OLED TV panels is one such example. These TV panels are the lowest blue light for now, which makes them more suitable for eye comfort.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nIn almost any field, be that business, medicine or engineering, AI has revolutionized the concept of efficiency. The electronics market has not only grasped the relevance of this technology for current applications but also for the exponential impacts that can be garnered in future technological progress. It is expected that the AI demand would increase by about 40% in the course of five years. Hence, it is not surprising that various electronic companies are continuously upgrading their products and investments in the arena. While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), have already infiltrated the generative AL software market with powerful computer chips like H100 and MI300X respectively, Intel (NASDAQ: INTL) has also ventured forth with new chips including Gaudi3.\n\nSimilarly, IBM (NYSE: IBM) are also in touch with the necessity of upgrading their AI systems. To this end, only this year they have a new data science platform- Watsonx. It is supposed to provide tools for building and organizing AI and arranging all data sources under one platform.\n\nFuture Forecast\n\nAs evidenced in almost all industries, the COVID-19 pandemic had volatile repercussions for consumers and businesses alike. The electronics industry was, thus one of the victims. Lock-downs and closures negatively impacted electronics sales. However, the work from home trend led to a reversal of the situations, increasing demand for items like computers etc.\n\nIn 2022, the global consumer electronics market was valued at $738.75 billion and it is predicted that this figure would change to $1,239.40 billion by the end of 2030. User-friendly Smart devices are likely to lie at the crux of growth amid increasing household sector and governmental support. While the Asian region has produced most electronics manufacturers, Europeans are also in the race to catch up. Below we present a list of the most advanced countries in electronics. 13 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics\n\nHigh angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most advanced countries in electronics, we’ve ranked them based on their electronics-manufacturing infrastructure, technology and research institutes. For this purpose, we’ve gathered data from various sources, including an FDI Intelligence report that evaluated countries’ locations for the quality of R&D in electronics based on infrastructure, talent availability and business environment. We’ve also accounted for the top electronics companies in these countries.

        "title": "3 stock picks for a shockingly resilient consumer market",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nOne week into 2024, and investors are being hit with several truths.\n\nThe first truth is that Magnificent Seven stocks don't go up every single day (despite what December's action showed...), and the downgrade buzzards on Wall Street lurk.\n\nApple (AAPL) shares are being hammered by analyst downgrades. Tesla (TSLA) is under pressure after meh delivery numbers. Nvidia's (NVDA) stock is treading water following a ginormous year of gains.\n\nAnother truth is this is a market that will remain super sensitive to anything that dents the view that a barrage of interest rate cuts are coming this year. So bulls, root for subpar macroeconomic data if you must.\n\nAnd the last truth is that the US consumer hasn't fallen apart, and is unlikely to do so in the first half of 2024. I mean, how else can one interpret the eye-popping December jobs report from Friday?\n\nThe labor market added 216,000 jobs in December, up from 173,000 in November. Economists had expected 175,000 for the month.\n\nThe US economy created 2.7 million new jobs in 2023. Unemployment is plumbing record lows. Wages are still rising.\n\n\"The economic backdrop is solid and provides a strong cushion for continued consumer spending,\" LPL chief global strategist Quincy Krosby told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nHow do you play this shocking resilience from an investing standpoint?\n\nExperts are signaling to stick with the consumer winners of last year.\n\nLooked at another way, pay up to own stocks of companies gaining clear market share or benefiting from economic and societal tailwinds.\n\nOne of my favorite retail analysts, Matt Boss over at JP Morgan, just lifted his same-store sales estimates on Lululemon (LULU), a name he has been bullish on. The company continues to dominate the athleisure space with extra high-quality offerings that are commanding ever premium prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoss also upped his profit estimates on Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF). I can't say I am surprised — the company had a massive third quarter of sales, and probably did so again during the holidays. The brand is once again the go-to destination for sub-30 year olds.\n\nMore on why in my chat with Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz in the above episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way.\n\nElsewhere, analysts that cover Costco (COST) such as Jefferies's Corey Tarlowe struck very bullish tones upon receiving Costco's December sales results late last week. Costco posted a December same-store sales increase of 8.1%, with growth in all product categories.\n\n\"We see prospects for Costco to deliver comparable sales 1-2 percentage points above historical levels based on: 1) channel shift from traditional grocery, department stores, and specialty retail; 2) higher growth among Gen Y/Z demos with stronger skew toward club offerings; and 3) bigger baskets as customers increasingly shop categories beyond food,\" Tarlowe wrote.\n\nI suspect good news from many retailers — reflecting consumer resilience — will be on display this week at the ICR conference in Florida. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma will be there all week reporting, so give her a follow on X.\n\nThat said, not everything is perfect in consumer land — something acknowledged in Boss's research.\n\n\"Digging deeper by demographic — excluding the $80 billion incremental COLA benefit (which impacts individuals aged 62 or over), our wallet analysis points to a $16 billion headwind on consumer spending for individuals under the age of 62 comprised of a $45 billion headwind from student loan repayment, $21 billion headwind from reduction in SNAP benefits, and $2 billion drag from tax refunds partially offset by a $51 billion tailwind from lower gas prices,\" Boss notes.\n\nBut overall, the consumer has wind at its back. It's worth doing a little bit of shopping for your portfolio in the new year.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter/X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "Forget Apple: This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Could Be the World's Biggest Company in 2024",
        "content": "So far, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the only company in the world that has been valued above $3 trillion. Even with some recent pullbacks for the stock, the tech giant still has a market capitalization of $2.82 trillion and ranks as the world's most valuable business.\n\nBut fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" member Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) currently has a market cap of $2.73 trillion and is nipping at the iPhone maker's heels. While there's no doubt that Apple is a great business, I believe that it will lose the title of \"World's Most Valuable Company\" in 2024 and that Microsoft will hold on to it for a while. Here's why.\n\nMicrosoft is delivering much stronger growth\n\nWith its most recent earnings report, Apple delivered revenue of $89.5 billion and net income of roughly $23 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft posted sales of $56.5 billion and net income of $22.3 billion.\n\nApple is still recording much more revenue, but the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business allows it to command superior margins. Given the recent trajectories for both businesses, Microsoft could be on track to surpass Apple's profits in the near future.\n\nTake a look at the chart below, which tracks Apple's sales and earnings growth over the last five reported quarters. Chart by author; Data source: Apple.\n\nEven though Apple has generally managed to keep growing earnings, its sales have slipped for four consecutive quarters.\n\nNow take a look at this chart tracking Microsoft's sales and earnings progression. Chart by author; Data source: Microsoft.\n\nWhile significant earnings declines show up at the beginning of Microsoft's chart, the comparative performance decline largely stems from tax benefits recorded in the previous year. On an adjusted basis, earnings would have grown 4% year over year in the company's September-ended quarter in 2022 and declined a more moderate 6% in the December-ended quarter in 2023.\n\nOverall, Microsoft's recent business momentum has been significantly more impressive than Apple's. And there are good reasons to think this trend will continue in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is lagging behind Microsoft's innovation\n\nThe overall progression of Apple's tech and products over the last five years has been iterative rather than revolutionary. The big improvements for the iPhone have largely come down to 5G compatibility and improvements in camera technology.\n\nOverall adoption for 5G is still at a relatively early stage. Because developers do not want to miss out on addressing the 4G market, this means that the number of applications specifically designed to take advantage of the new generation of network tech remains limited.\n\nMeanwhile, the jumps in camera technology that are included with each generation of iPhone technology are nice, but the point of diminishing returns has clearly been reached.\n\nBy comparison, Microsoft continues to deliver more significant improvements for its Azure cloud infrastructure platform. Crucially, its cloud service positions the company to be one of the absolute top players in the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn addition to strong momentum for Azure, Microsoft has built a forefront position in AI-powered personal assistants. Its operating systems, productivity software, search unit, gaming business, and other products should also benefit from artificial intelligence integration.\n\nWhile Apple is undoubtedly working on many artificial intelligence projects and has natural strengths in the space thanks to its massive and loyal user base, Microsoft's position in the category currently looks stronger overall.\n\nAgain, the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business puts it in a position to record better margins than Apple due to manufacturing costs and other expenses that come with being more hardware-oriented.\n\nApple still has what it takes to be a strong long-term investment, and the company will undoubtedly release some innovative and highly influential products in the near future. However, I believe Microsoft will soon become the world's most valuable company, and I expect it to have the better-performing stock over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Despite economic uncertainty, Wall Street delivered phenomenal returns to patient investors in 2023. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite rallied 24% and 43%, respectively, by the time the curtain closed.\n\nAlthough the rally became a bit more broad-based in the final two months of the year, the outperformance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is widely credited with lifting the broader market higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to what have consistently been the seven largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. by market cap:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nApple clocked in as the \"worst\" of the bunch with a 48% return in 2023, while Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia rallied 102%, 194%, and 239%, respectively. AAPL Chart\n\nWhat investors seem to appreciate about the Magnificent Seven stocks is their undeniable competitive advantages.\n\nApple's iPhone is responsible for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share, and its share repurchase program is unmatched by other public companies. Microsoft's Windows is still the undisputed leader in desktop operating systems, while Azure has gobbled up a 25% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Alphabet's Google accounted for close to 92% of worldwide internet search share in December. Meanwhile, streaming platform YouTube (also owned by Alphabet) attracts more than 2.7 billion unique viewers each month. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brings in an estimated 40% of U.S. online retail sales, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) leading the world in cloud infrastructure service spending share (31%), as of the third quarter. Nvidia is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nvidia may account for more than 90% of all graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers in 2024. Meta Platforms owns the world's top social media \"real estate.\" Facebook is the most-visited site globally, with WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger collectively (with Facebook) attracting close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's comfortably reached recurring profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn spite of these competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven stocks could differ dramatically in the new year. Whereas one Magnificent Seven stock is effectively cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company, another expensive highflier appears poised for a reality check.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in 2024: Amazon\n\nAmong the seven industry titans listed above, the one investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024, and likely hold for many years to come, is e-commerce company Amazon.\n\nThe biggest potential headwind for Amazon in the new year is the possibility of a U.S. recession taking shape. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggest a downturn is likely. Since Amazon generates so much of its revenue from its online marketplace, a recession would be expected to slow consumer spending.\n\nBut there are two important things to understand about this headwind for Amazon. First, recessions are historically short-lived. Only three of 12 U.S. recessions following World War II have surpassed 12 months, and none have made it past 18 months. Betting on economic expansion has always been a winning move for patient investors.\n\nSecondly, but most important, Amazon generates very little of its operating cash flow and operating income from its mammoth online marketplace. Even if online retail sales were to taper a bit, it would likely have a negligible impact on the company's cash flow and bottom line.\n\nWhat can carry Amazon's stock to new highs in 2024 is the company's high-growth ancillary operating segments, which are led by AWS.\n\nAs noted, AWS accounts for nearly a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending. Cloud service margins can run circles around the razor-thin margins associated with online retail sales. As a result, AWS is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income despite generating only a sixth of the company's net sales. With enterprise cloud-service spending still ramping up, AWS looks to have a long runway of double-digit growth ahead of it.\n\nDon't overlook Amazon's advertising services segment, either. This is a company that's drawing more than 2 billion people to its site on a monthly basis, many of which are motivated shoppers. This puts the ball in Amazon's court when it comes to ad-pricing power. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered at least 21% year-over-year constant-currency sales growth over the past eight quarters (two years).\n\nAlthough some fundamentally focused investors are going to be turned off by Amazon's astronomical trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 75, the traditional P/E ratio is a terrible way to value cutting-edge companies like Amazon that are reinvesting the bulk of their operating cash flow back into their business. Valuing Amazon relative to its cash flow is, therefore, a much smarter approach.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Amazon was regularly valued at a multiple of 23 to 37 times cash flow. It can be scooped up right now for less than 13 times forecast cash flow in 2024. With the exception of the 2022 bear market, it's the cheapest Amazon has traded, relative to its future cash flow, since going public in 1997. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Nvidia\n\nOn the other side of the coin, semiconductor giant Nvidia has all the hallmarks of a stock to avoid like the plague in 2024.\n\nI'll absolutely give Nvidia credit where credit is due for more than tripling in value last year. With interest in AI soaring, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs quickly became staples in AI-accelerated data centers. Considering that chip fabrication juggernaut Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is significantly beefing up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble delivering more of its AI-driven GPUs in the quarters to come.\n\nSo, what's the problem? Pricing power, growing competition, regulatory headwinds, and history all come to mind.\n\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ends later this month, the company's sales are expected to climb by approximately 119% from the previous year. Almost the entirety of this growth can be traced to the company's GPUs from its data-center segment. More specifically, it's being driven by jaw-dropping pricing power.\n\nThrough the first six months of fiscal 2024, Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined from the prior-year period. Through the first nine months, it's only jumped by an aggregate of 20%. What this tells investors is that A100 and H100 scarcity is what's driven Nvidia's sales growth. Ironically, ramping up its own production in the current calendar year is liable to sap its pricing power and adversely impact its gross margin.\n\nTo build on this point, competition in AI-focused GPUs is bound to pick up. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to roll it out in a big way throughout 2024. Likewise, Intel plans to bring its Falcon Shores GPU to market as a direct competitor to Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips in 2025. This should provide further downside pressure on Nvidia's pricing power.\n\nRegulators are doing Nvidia no favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have imposed restrictions on AI-GPU exports to China. This is a potentially big blow to Nvidia, which regularly generates between 20% and 25% of its sales from the world's No. 2 global economy by gross domestic product.\n\nLastly, history could be Nvidia's worst enemy in the new year. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years that's avoided an initial bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have a tendency to overestimate the adoption/uptake of new innovations without giving them the proper time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to the rule, which could sink Nvidia's proverbial ship in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Augmented reality stocks are a signal of innovation in our ever changing technological world, offering an insight into the future. This industry which is sometimes associated with companies focused on virtual reality completely changes the way we interact with technology. Informally known as AV stocks, they span a spectrum of possibilities, from enhancing consumer experiences to revolutionizing worker training.\n\nVR products are no longer confined to gaming and entertainment. They are cutting themselves a niche in many fields, making what was once science fiction, a reality. Together, AV and VR stocks are more than just technical investments; they represent visions, foresight and anticipation beyond traditional technological bounds. Given our position at this technological point, it is clear that investing in augmented reality stocks is more than a savvy financial game. It is a jump into the future of untapped potential and endless possibilities and opportunities.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent dive into augmented and virtual reality markets heralds a pivotal shift, potentially rejuvenating these sectors. It introduced the Apple Vision Pro, a high-tech combination of AR and VR. This hardware is promising to fit into daily activities just as easily as the iPhone has managed to do. It is largely a VR headset, augmented with AR through peripheral cameras. It will debut early next year at a price of $3,499.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, Apple’s robust services revenue trajectory could escalate with the AR device. This innovation might bolster subscription growth by enriching fitness and video content with AR. The advent of metaverse-related services, like AR apps, hints at a revenue composition shift, possibly eclipsing iPhone sales within five years.\n\nIn stock market terms, Apple’s venture could be transformative, shaping investor perspectives and impacting stock performance. This involvement in a burgeoning sector is also instrumental in its future growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), famous for the manufacturing of mobile chipsets, is now approaching the markets for augmented and virtual reality. Originally known for its popularity in terms of mobile technology, Qualcomm also has a role to play in AR and VR chipset development. Its Snapdragon 835 and 845 chipsets are crucial in the VR industry, leading to advanced stand-alone VR headsets. The Snapdragon XR1 platform, a pioneer in extended reality, supports interactive controls and high-resolution video.\n\nOn a financial note, Qualcomm’s XR income from its IoT department is also on the rise, The development denotes the growth of the AR and VR market. The company’s strong position in the tech industry and partnerships, such as supplying RF chips to Apple, support its position in the industry. Its foray into VR glasses lands it as a major contender against top-tier products and confirms its tech presence.\n\nAs a result, Qualcomm’s involvement in AR and VR technologies pinpoints it as one of the main players among augmented and virtual reality stocks. Its attention to these changing technologies is an indicator of a bright future for these rapidly emerging fields.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is making significant inroads in augmented and virtual reality marketplaces. It is modifying how the metaverse functions to make it more user-friendly. This method allows individuals to have fun, study and converse in a fictitious setting. The company’s innovative strategy has increased daily active users, boosting its performance in AV, VR and AR prospects. In the third quarter of 2023, the platform reported 70 million daily active users worldwide.\n\nIn comparison to its peers like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Unity Software (NYSE:U), Roblox presents a unique investment profile. Meta Platforms delves into VR and AR products through its Reality Labs. Meanwhile, Unity Software champions the creation of 3D interactive environments. This diversity underscores the broad spectrum of opportunities within the VR and AR sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, Roblox’s trajectory in the VR and AR scene demonstrates the importance of its role in designing virtual experiences. Roblox positions itself to preserve its role as a significant participant as VR and AR technology progresses. Its importance in the business is not a passing fad, but rather evidence of its long-term significance.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Betting Big On for 2024",
        "content": "For the better part of nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been running circles around the broader market. Whereas the broad-based S&P 500 has gained roughly 31,200%, including dividends paid, since the Oracle of Omaha became CEO in the mid-1960s, Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) have skyrocketed by 4,384,747%, as of the end of 2023.\n\nWarren Buffett's phenomenal investment track record has garnered him quite the following. Considering how profitable it's been to ride the Oracle of Omaha's coattails, it's not uncommon for investors to mirror Buffett's trading activity.\n\nDespite an exceptionally strong year for equities in 2023, there are still a handful of companies catching the attention of Buffett and his investment team. As we lift the curtain on 2024, Warren Buffett is betting big on the following five stocks. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple\n\nAfter the first trading day of the new year, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for nearly 47% of Berkshire Hathaway's $362 billion investment portfolio. But even though Apple has represented an outsized position for years, it didn't stop Buffett and his team from purchasing more than 20 million additional shares last year.\n\nApple checks most of the key boxes Warren Buffett and his investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) look for in a company. It offers brand-name products and services, has a well-trusted management team, is highly profitable, and has an exceptionally loyal customer base.\n\nMore specifically, Apple's iPhone has gobbled up more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, the company's services segment continues to grow like wildfire, with a shift to subscription services expected to lift the company's operating margin over time and lessen the sales fluctuations observed during iPhone replacement cycles.\n\nApple's capital-return program is also unmatched among publicly traded companies. The world's largest public company by market cap is doling out $15 billion annually in dividend payments, and has repurchased over $600 billion of its common stock since the start of 2013.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe one knock against Apple is its valuation. While Warren Buffett is typically a sticker for value -- this is something he learned decades ago from the late, great Charlie Munger -- Apple is trading for nearly 27 times forward-year earnings, which is historically high given its recent lack of growth.\n\nBank of America\n\nAnother top holding Warren Buffett and his investing aides are clearly betting big on in the new year is Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Though Berkshire entered 2023 with 1.01 billion shares of BofA already in its portfolio, Buffett and his investing team proceeded to purchase more than 22.7 million additional shares in the March-ended quarter.\n\nThe lure of bank stocks for Warren Buffett is that they're cyclical. Even though recessions are a perfectly normal and inevitable aspect of the economic cycle, downturns are short-lived. Not one recession following World War II has lasted longer than 18 months. That compares to two periods of economic growth that lasted at least a decade. Disproportionately long periods of expansion allow banks to grow their loan portfolios and generate valuable interest income.\n\nSpeaking of interest income, no U.S. money-center bank has benefited more from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle than Bank of America. A collective 525-basis-point increase in the federal funds target rate since March 2022 has lifted the interest rates on outstanding variable-rate loans and boosted BofA's net interest income by billions of dollars each quarter.\n\nInvestors also have to be pleased with Bank of America's investments in technology paying off. As more users shift to digital banking, which is considerably cheaper for banks than in-person interactions, Bank of America has the option of consolidating some of its physical branches and lowering its operating expenses.\n\nAs long as Bank of America's stock trades at or around its book value, you won't have to twist Warren Buffett's arm to potentially buy more shares. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\n\nIt's also plainly evident that Warren Buffett is betting big on energy stock Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) in 2024. Berkshire Hathaway added more than 49 million shares of Occidental's common stock in 2023, with Buffett and his crew building this 243.7-million-share position from scratch over the past two years.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha and his team aren't riding a $14.6 billion position without a purpose. They're very likely betting on the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated, if not head even higher.\n\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, which created uncertainty for Europe's energy supply needs. Additionally, global energy companies meaningfully reduced their capital expenditures for three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these factors have tightened global oil supply, which is likely to have a positive effect on the spot price of crude oil.\n\nWhat makes Occidental Petroleum so attractive is its reliance on drilling. Although it's an integrated oil and gas company that also operates chemical plants, it generates a disproportionate percentage of its revenue from drilling. If the spot price of crude remains elevated or heads even higher, Occidental's cash flow will benefit immensely.\n\nJust keep in mind that Occidental's balance sheet is a potential question mark. Despite paying down more than $17 billion in net debt following its acquisition of Anadarko, it's still sitting on $18.6 billion in net debt, as of Sept. 30, 2023. It very much needs the spot price for crude oil to remain high to improve the flexibility of its levered balance sheet.\n\nCapital One Financial\n\nA fourth stock Warren Buffett is betting big on in the new year is financial-services provider Capital One Financial(NYSE: COF). Berkshire's investment team gobbled up a little more than 9.9 million shares of Capital One during the first quarter of 2023, and purchased around 2.55 million additional shares during the June-ended quarter. Entering 2024, this position was worth north of $1.6 billion.\n\nSimilar to BofA, Warren Buffett's billion-dollar bet on Capital One looks to be a function of cyclicality and value.\n\nCapital One is best-known as being one the nation's largest issuers of credit cards. The company closed out September with $144 billion in credit card loans on its books, $137.5 billion of which can be traced to the United States. With the U.S. economy shrugging off recessionary fears and the U.S. savings rate declining, Capital One Financial's credit-services segment has enjoyed an ideal operating environment.\n\nThe one caveat to the above is that Capital One's loan portfolio tends to be more reliant on subprime borrowers, when compared to the typical U.S. lender. If the U.S. economy contracts, subprime borrowers are, historically, likelier to default on their payments. There are a couple of money-based metrics that suggest 2024 could be a difficult year for the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nThe other lure with Capital One Financial is its valuation. Similar to Bank of America, it's trading right around its book value and is sporting a forward-year earnings multiple of less than 10.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\n\nThe fifth stock Warren Buffett is betting big on for 2024 is none other than his own company, Berkshire Hathaway. The Oracle of Omaha and late executive vice chairman Charlie Munger approved the purchase of Berkshire Hathaway stock for 21 consecutive quarters (July 2018-September 2023), totaling an aggregate of more than $72 billion.\n\nSince Warren Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, buying back stock is one of the easiest ways to reward existing shareholders. Conducting more than $72 billion in repurchases is slowly but surely increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. It's a way of driving home the long-term ethos that Buffett and Munger have championed for decades.\n\nFurthermore, repurchasing stock reduces the number of shares outstanding, which for companies with steady or growing net income -- i.e., Berkshire Hathaway, sans unrealized changes in the value of its investment portfolio -- can increase earnings per share (EPS). A boost to EPS can make a fundamentally attractive company like Berkshire all the more desirable for value-seeking investors.\n\nI believe it's also worth suggesting that Buffett's aggressive share buyback program reflects the confidence he and Munger had in the company they'd built over many years. This dynamic duo loaded their company's investment portfolio and owned assets with cyclical businesses that are poised to benefit from extended periods of economic growth.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is the stock Warren Buffett is virtually guaranteed to buy in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

        "content": "By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Apple's iPhone sales in China dropped by 30% in the first week of 2024, Jefferies analysts said in a note, adding to signs of growing competitive pressures from domestic rivals such as Huawei for the U.S. tech giant.\n\nThe decline in Apple's sales was the primary catalyst for an overall double-digit drop in China smartphone shipments for the first week, according to a note the brokerage published on Sunday. Other Android brands and Huawei achieved relatively flat growth year-over-year during this period, the note said.\n\nThis decrease in Apple's sales took place despite aggressive discounting of multiple iPhone models through major Chinese online marketplaces, according to the research note. For example, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max received a 16% price reduction on the e-commerce platform Pinduoduo in the first week of 2024.\n\nThe 30% drop represents an acceleration from the 3% year-over-year decline the U.S. company saw for all of 2023 in its third-largest market, Jefferies said, adding that the brokerage derived this from its own market tracking. Specifically, the 3% decline in 2023 equated to a 0.4% decrease in Apple's market share.\n\nJefferies analysts said Apple's decline is largely attributed to competitive pressures from Chinese rivals, especially Huawei, which launched its Mate 60 series of phones in August last year.\n\nApple and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Mate 60 line is widely viewed as marking Huawei's comeback to the high-end smartphone market after years of U.S. sanctions that had previously hampered its progress.\n\nFor the final quarter of 2023, Huawei's share in the Chinese smartphone market rose by about 6%, according to the note.\n\nAccording to the Jefferies analysts, Apple will likely face more competitive pressure from domestic rivals throughout 2024. Their forecast predicts Apple's shipment volumes will continue declining by double digits in 2024, while Huawei is expected to continue gaining market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, they estimate that Huawei will ship approximately 64 million smartphones worldwide in 2024 - up substantially from the estimated less than 35 million shipped in 2023.\n\nFollowing a years-long slump, the Chinese smartphone market is poised for a rebound other analysts have forecasted, with research firm IDC predicting unspecified year-on-year sales growth in the fourth quarter after ten consecutive quarters of falling shipments.\n\n(Reporting by Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh, Editing by Louise Heavens)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s iPhone sales slump in China is deepening and the company is likely to see volumes decline further this year, according to Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Boeing Max Grounding Goes Global as Carriers Follow FAA Order China Says It Caught Foreign Consultant Spying for UK’s MI6\n\nThe iPhone maker’s latest generation got off to an atypically sluggish start in China last year, which most recently expanded to a 30% year-on-year decline, Lee and colleagues said in a note on Sunday, citing industry checks. The rest of the country’s mobile market grew in December, with Huawei Technologies Co. growing fastest on the back of its new Mate 60 device lineup.\n\nWeeks before the iPhone 15 went on sale in September, Huawei’s debut of the Mate 60 Pro — which runs on a new made-in-China system processor — spurred a patriotic fervor that reclaimed some of the customers it previously lost to Apple. Jefferies estimates Huawei shipped 35 million smartphones in 2023, with some supply constraints preventing that number from being larger.\n\nApple saw a double-digit fall in volumes in December and Jefferies forecasts a similar decline for 2024. Discounts on Apple’s smartphone range increased last week across various online shopping portals, cutting into the average selling price without stimulating growth in volume.\n\nApple gained share in China after US sanctions cut Huawei off from the world’s leading chipmakers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., in 2020. The Shenzhen-based electronics firm’s return to competitiveness in the mobile market has seen it claw back market share, and it’s now developing its own software ecosystem to compete with Apple’s iOS and Alphabet Inc.’s Android.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump’s?

        "content": "Looking back at the history of consumer technology, society evolved from compelling but cumbersome equipment to portable devices, which naturally necessitates a discussion about wearable technology stocks. Indeed, modern innovations translate to increasingly smaller, more convenient and ultimately smarter devices.\n\nGiven the broader integration of consumer-focused devices, investors will want to position themselves accordingly. Per MarketsandMarkets, the wearable tech market size will likely reach a valuation of $265.4 billion by 2026. That comes out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% from levels seen in 2021. Further, it’s possible that as emerging economies grow, this estimated projection may prove understated.\n\nEither way, it’s a hot arena with multiple players plying their trade in the ecosystem. To take advantage, below are enticing wearable technology stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it might be an obvious idea for wearable technology stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has consistently demonstrated its relevance despite cycles of doubt. Indeed, AAPL gained almost 46% of equity value in the past 52 weeks, demonstrating resilience despite tough economic pressures. And that’s part of the reason why analysts continue to stick with Apple, rating it a consensus moderate buy.\n\nFurther, with an average price target of $202.50, AAPL may continue to reward shareholders, even this late in the game. With its Apple Watch continuing to outperform – indeed, the company saw its best ever third-quarter numbers for the wearable device – there seems to be no stopping this juggernaut. As further evidence, in Q3, its gross margin increased to 45.17% (from 42.26% in the year-ago quarter).\n\nHere’s why that’s significant: we’re talking impressive pricing power despite economic hardships for the consumer. With households struggling with inflation and high borrowing costs, you’d expect them to tighten their belts. They are but they’re still buying Apple products. And Apple isn’t really offering a discount. That’s impressive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking for wearable technology stocks, you probably can’t go wrong with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). I say that because if you’re looking for most things related to tech, you arguably can’t go wrong with Alphabet. Effectively the owner of the internet through its Google search engine, the innovation juggernaut enjoys a strong buy consensus view.\n\nIn addition, you’re talking about an average price target of $155.60, implying almost 13% growth. That’s not bad given the maturity of the business (and thus its predictability and dependability). Specifically regarding wearable technology stocks, Alphabet a few years back bought out the fitness tracker company Fitbit. While that hasn’t been the greatest acquisition, it demonstrates the focus on wearables. For instance, its Pixel Watch has resonated with consumers.\n\nBesides, Alphabet has its hands on everything, given it a resilient financial profile. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 22.9% while it achieves excellent operating and net margins. If you’re seeking a wide canvas, GOOG makes a solid case for wearable technology stocks to buy.\n\nXiaomi (XIACF) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks.\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Chinese designer and manufacturer of consumer electronics, Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACF) also specializes in software, home appliances, automobiles, and household hardware. Per its public profile, Xiaomi is the second-largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world. If you’re seeking a global play among wearable tech stocks, XIACF could be your ticket. Also, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy.\n\nTo be clear about the last point,  we’re not talking about two analysts agreeing that XIACF is a buy. Rather, nine experts within the past three months endorse Xiaomi. Also, their average price target lands at $2.66, implying over 37% upside potential. Fundamentally, the company intrigues speculators because it provides relevant products like portable earbuds and attractive smartwatches. These products are also offered at relatively attractive prices.\n\nIndeed, as wearable tech becomes more commoditized, the scale of Xiaomi could provide a clear advantage. While it’s not the most consistently profitable enterprise, it does feature a three-year revenue growth rate of 9.8%, which is above average. Also, it trades at a 9.31X free cash flow, which sits favorably below 68.64% of its peers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures showed mixed movement on Sunday night following the first week of 2024, which saw the major averages decline. Traders are now turning their attention to the upcoming inflation data and significant bank earnings set to be released later in the week.\n\nBy 6:20 pm ET (11:20 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures were 0.1% lower, while S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 Futures added 0.1% apiece.\n\nDuring last week's trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%, while the S&P 500 declined by 0.6%. The tech-centric Nasdaq Composite recorded its poorest weekly performance since September, falling by 3.3%.\n\nApple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a significant slide of around 6% last week, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note swung back above 4%.\n\nAfter a year-end rally driven by the Federal Reserve's dovish stance, markets consolidated amidst concerns that equities are now overvalued. A robust December jobs report, coupled with the release of Fed meeting minutes this week suggesting heightened uncertainty around the trajectory of rate cuts, have intensified these concerns.\n\nIn the United States, all eyes are on the upcoming US inflation data for further insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook. Forecasts suggest that consumer prices likely increased by 0.2% in December, following a 0.1% gain in November. Meanwhile, the core rate is predicted to have risen by 0.2%, marking a slight decrease from the previous month's 0.3% increase. On an annual basis, the headline inflation rate is expected to bounce back to 3.2% from November's five-month low of 3.1%, while the core rate is likely to have eased to 3.9%, the lowest since May 2021.\n\nThis week, traders will gain more insight into the central bank's path of rate cuts. The December consumer price index, set for release on Thursday, and the producer price index due out on Friday, will indicate whether the Fed's efforts to curb inflation to its 2% target are proving effective.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe upcoming corporate earnings season will commence on Friday, with major banks such as Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) set to release their results. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), a Dow component, will also report its earnings, along with BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL).\n\nStay updated with the latest earnings results with InvestingPro+!

That's the highest percentage of its revenue in 20 years, around the time when the tech titan was expanding its iPod and music business and developing the first iPhone. AAPL R&D to Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nApple's R&D has been steadily climbing over the last decade, but there hasn't been a major new product since the Apple Watch in 2015. The new Vision Pro headset is coming this year, but the company hasn't made any significant changes to the design of its existing products in years.\n\nWhen we look at where Apple is investing its cash, it may not necessarily point to lots of innovation on the product front, but it could still have a major impact on Apple's returns to investors.\n\nApple is widening its competitive moat\n\nWhen asked on the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook explained that the increase in R&D is going toward a lot of things:\n\nIt's ... some things I can't talk about. It's Vision Pro. It's [artificial intelligence] and [machine learning]. It's the silicon investment that we're making, the transition with the Mac and other silicon.\n\nThe silicon he's referring to is the transition away from Intel processors to its own chips for Mac and other products.\n\nApple has invested for many years in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, most notably in the Siri voice assistant. Cook hinted there's more going on, but that could mean many things for Apple's product development road map.\n\nThe problem is that Apple is a gigantic company with $383 billion in annual revenue. When the iPhone was first released in 2007, Apple was a fraction of that size. The days of releasing a single device that moves the needle and sends the stock to the Moon are long gone.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, all the things Cook mentioned are going toward widening the company's competitive moat and building a more profitable business. This explains why Warren Buffett continues to hold a massive stake in Apple stock, and why investors should consider holding shares, too.\n\nApple's investments are creating enormous shareholder value\n\nApple is not releasing groundbreaking new products that change the world, but it's enjoying a strong profit margin that is starting to trend toward record highs again. This is why the stock climbed 47% in 2023 despite lower sales. AAPL Profit Margin Chart\n\nHigher margins can be traced back to the company's boost in R&D spending. Cook mentioned some of the R&D increase is going toward AI. This technology is the backbone of many features on the iPhone, including Siri, searching photos, Face ID, and the neural engine that enables the iPhone's camera to capture better images. These features raise customer satisfaction and spending on services, which generate twice the margin of hardware products.\n\nServices, including sales from apps and subscriptions, is Apple's fastest-growing business, expanding 9% year over year in fiscal 2023. Management clearly sees more growth for services over the long term.\n\n\"Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem,\" CFO Luca Maestri noted on the last earnings call.\n\nBecause services still only makes up 22% of Apple's total sales and is growing faster than other sales categories, its margins and profits should remain on an upward trajectory. Management is directing investment at the heart of Apple's competitive advantage, which is its brand and user experience, and that spells rising profits and dividend increases, as well as a stock that should be hitting new highs for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer recently said in a program that the time has come for investors to take some profits on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks as the market begins to undergo a rotation. Cramer said “it’s a new market” in 2024 and financial, healthcare and small-cap stocks which were put on the backburner by the Street amid recession fears are now in the spotlight. Cramer said that the market is favoring “boring” stocks with high yields as investors believe recession fears have been managed by the Federal Reserve and rates are expected to come down.\n\nCramer said long-term interest rates peaked in October 2023 and since then high-yield dividend stocks have been “flying\" while Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their leadership position when it comes to stock market gains. Cramer said that during most of 2023 Magnificent Seven stocks, which include major companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), among other tech leaders, led the stock market gains. But after October 2023, things have changed. Cramer shared a chart which showed S&P 500 performance trends on an equal-weighted basis. Data shows that an equal-weighted S&P 500 has beaten the Magnificent Seven index by 13.4% from October 2023 through January 3, 2024.\n\nJim Cramer said that “all sorts of stocks” are now showing strong performance and gains are no longer limited to the seven major tech stocks. Cramer mentioned some major banks and said financial stocks have been among the top performers in the current environment.\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted that there’s a broader money rotation going on in the market right now, with major tech stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Tesla acting as “sources of funds.” That means money managers are taking profits from these stocks and putting these funds into other companies that have hitherto been ignored amid the macro economic backdrop.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article we decided to evaluate the performance of Jim Cramer’s predictions and analysis. Back in September we covered some stocks Jim Cramer was recommending investors to sell. In this article we took a look at the performance of those stocks to see whether Cramer’s predictions and sell calls were right or wrong. For each stock we mentioned its performance over the past few months and the reasons behind Cramer’s bearish outlook on these companies.\n\nThe list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in these companies. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks: How Did They Perform?\n\n12. Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 2\n\nJim Cramer called Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) a “mess” in 2023 and said he was unable to understand how Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) makes money. Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) shares have plummeted about 39% over the past six months. Problems started for Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) last year after a short report from Hindenburg Research accused the company of overstating asset values.\n\nJust two hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 funds had stakes in Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nLast year Cramer remained bullish on quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and kept recommending investors to stay away from money-losing stocks.\n\n11. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 11\n\nBack in August 2023, Jim Cramer said that investing in spacecraft company Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) was akin to “sending your money up in smoke.” Over the past six months the stock has lost about 7% in value. However, December 2023 was a great month for Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) as it announced multiple positive news. The US government awarded Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) a $515 million contract to design, manufacture, deliver, and operate 18 space vehicles.  Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) also successfully launched its 42nd Electron rocket and deployed a satellite for Japan-based Earth imaging company the Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space.\n\n10. Telus Corp (NYSE:TU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nJim Cramer in August 2023 called the Canadian telecom company Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) a “loser” as the analyst believes there are multiple companies in the market doing the same thing as Telus Corp (NYSE:TU).\n\nOver the past six months, Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) shares have lost about 9% in value. In November, Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) upped its quarterly dividend by 3.4%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Telus Corp (NYSE:TU).\n\n9. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nBitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) ranks 9th in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was recommending selling last year. In November 2023, Jim Cramer said the following about the company:\n\n“They don’t make any money...If you want to do Bitcoin, own Bitcoin.”\n\nOver the past six months, Riot Platforms shares have gained about 16%.\n\nEarlier this month, the company said it produced 619 bitcoins in December 2023, a 12% increase month over month and a 9% decline on a yearly basis.\n\n8. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nLast year, when asked about his thoughts on solid state lithium metal battery company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS), Jim Cramer made a “hard pass” on the stock and said “there’s nothing there” about Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The stock has lost about 6.6% over the past six months.\n\nInsider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 20 hedge funds had stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The biggest stakeholder of Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) during this period was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $40 million stake in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS).\n\nThe company in its Q3 earnings call talked about its business performance and guidance:\n\n\"Despite these changes in the timing of CapEx, we continue to target low-volume B samples in 2024 and higher-volume B samples in 2025. During Q3, our CapEx primarily went toward facility and equipment spend for our consolidated QS-0 pre-pilot line, including for our Raptor process. For the remainder of the year, our CapEx will continue to be predominantly allocated toward QS-0. During the quarter, we raised $300 million in gross proceeds from our public follow-on offering. We ended Q3 with over $1.1 billion in liquidity and continue to look for opportunities to optimize our spending and be prudent with our strong balance sheet.\n\nWe now forecast our cash runway will extend into 2026. Any additional funds raised from capital markets activity, including under our ATM prospectus supplement, would further extend this cash runway. Longer term, our capital requirements will be a function of our industrialization business model, which we believe could reflect a mix of wholly owned production, joint venture, and licensing relationships. With that, I’ll hand things over to Jagdeep for a final word on our strategic outlook.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n7. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nIn December 2022, Jim Cramer said the following about EV company Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID):\n\n“We don’t want to fool around with that. The thing just goes down and down. I see a trend. ... I think that one is just too dangerous.”\n\nFast forward to June 2023, Cramer’s thoughts about Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) hadn’t budged as he said, while answering a call about Rivian Automotive, that investors should sell Rivian and Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) because they were money-losing companies.\n\nJim Cramer has been right about the stock since Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) shares have gone nowhere but down. Over the past six months Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) stock lost about 47% in value.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID).\n\n6. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nIn August 2023, Jim Cramer said Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) investors should take profits should the stock bounce back since Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) has “disappointed” for so long.\n\nIn December 2023, Jim Cramer said that he was “pulling the plug” on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) and Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) is now a “no go” for him.\n\nPlug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares have lost about 58% over the past six months.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 26 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). The most significant stakeholder of the firm during this period is Israel Englander’s Millennium Management which owns a $26 million stake in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG).\n\nWhile PLUG is a sell according to Cramer, throughout 2023, he remained bullish on tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company talked about its Q4 guidance in its Q3 earnings call:\n\nIn the fourth quarter, we anticipate the revenue from our new ventures will surpass revenue from our traditional business for the first time as our electrolyzers and cryogenic businesses continue to grow. Finally, I’d like to just like to reflect on the conversation I had yesterday morning with a European customer supplier and partner. He gets toward our facilities and remind me that no one has built hydrogen infrastructure on the scale we have. No one has our product set, no one has technical talent, no one has our customer relationships and no one has our real life experiences. It remains our belief and his there is the market for hydrogen fuel cell grows, no one is in a better position than Plug to take advantage of this opportunity. This is just a bump on the road.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires 13 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now George Soros and Jim Cramer Love These Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Apple: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "content": "With the holidays in the rearview mirror, the new year brings hope and renewal. It's also a good time to turn the page and analyze whether you should buy, sell, or hold certain stocks.\n\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock performed very well last year, with the share price increasing by 48%. That's about double the S&P 500's gain. If you owned the shares, that makes for a very happy new year.\n\nBut what should holders or prospective buyers do now? Examining the company's offerings and valuation will lead to an informed decision. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNew phones, lackluster boost\n\nApple generates most of its sales from iPhones. In the latest fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2023, iPhones accounted for 52% of its $383.3 billion of sales.\n\nManagement released the latest version last September. However, the iPhone 15 didn't provide a major boost to Apple's fourth-quarter top line. For the period, iPhone sales grew by 2.8% to $43.8 billion. CEO Tim Cook noted record iPhone sales in China and blamed supply issues for the tepid sales growth.\n\nNonetheless, data shows the device had been losing worldwide market share with strong competition from Huawei, among others. Additionally, China's government has limited iPhone usage by government employees.\n\nBased on the number of shipments, iPhone's worldwide market share was 16% in the calendar year's third quarter compared to 23% at the end of 2022, according to Counterpoint. It dominates the U.S. market with an over 50% share.\n\nOther products and services\n\nApple's offerings include Mac personal computers, iPads, smartwatches, wireless headphones, and a variety of services. They have generally produced lackluster sales. In the fourth quarter, iPhone, Mac, iPad, and wearables, home, and accessories had lower sales than a year ago.\n\nEconomic factors, such as stressed consumers dealing with overall higher prices, explain part of the weaker sales. However, there were also company-specific issues, such as a lack of new innovative products.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement hopes to get a boost from Vision Pro, a mixed reality headset that it plans to release this year. The price tag, about $3,500, may prove challenging to buyers, though.\n\nServices remain a bright spot, however. Apple's services include advertising, product support and repair, cloud, and payments. Fourth-quarter sales grew by over 16% to $22.3 billion. And the business has a much higher gross margin than the company's products. Last year, services had a 70.8% gross margin, nearly double products' 36.5%.\n\nValuation\n\nThe stock's large gain last year has created a more expensive valuation. The shares sell at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30 compared to the low 20s a year ago. That's also higher than the S&P 500's P/E multiple of 26.\n\nWith a higher valuation comes the expectation of faster sales and earnings growth. However, I have questions about whether Apple's key iPhone product will resume higher sales growth and I'd like to see its other products reverse the negative sales trend. Despite services doing well, it's insufficient for me to buy the stock on that basis alone.\n\nGiven the stock price's run-up, I'd look to cash in and sell the shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company has been the world's most valuable publicly-listed company since July 2022, but has seen about US$177 billion in market value erased so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWhile the stock has suffered bigger percentage declines in the first week of January, the losses are the biggest market value destruction at the start of any year on record.\n\nThe downturn began earlier in the week after the technology giant was hit by two ratings downgrades, with analysts flagging a weak macro environment in China pressuring demand for iPhones.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat has shrunk its lead over fellow technology juggernaut Microsoft Corp - whose shares have seen a less pronounced decline to begin the year - to less than US$100 billion.\n\n\"Investors realise how rare it is to have two people go negative,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management. \"I've been covering this company for a long time and I've never seen two downgrades before an earnings report.\"\n\nApple is also likely under pressure as investors rotate their portfolios at the start of the year.\n\n\"Everybody's selling their winners and buying losers,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"There's a big rebalance going on.\"\n\nThe losses have pushed Apple's market value down to about US$2.8 trillion, nearing Microsoft's US$2.7 trillion. Shares of Microsoft fell less than 0.1 per cent Friday to close at about US$368.\n\nThe Windows software maker has benefited from the artificial intelligence trade that has mesmerised Wall Street over the past year. The company is OpenAI's largest shareholder and has invested about US$13 billion into the ChatGPT parent.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Foxconn Technology Group, the world's biggest iPhone assembler, expects revenue to decline in the first quarter of 2024 amid weak global consumer electronics demand, extending a decrease in sales in the past three months.\n\nTaiwan-based Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, did not provide an estimate on the drop in quarterly revenue, but said the first three months will be compared to a high base in the same period last year, when its factories in mainland China resumed normal operations after disruptive pandemic controls were relaxed by the government, according to the company's statement on Friday.\n\nThe world's largest electronics contract manufacturer also indicated that the year's first quarter is typically an off-peak season for the industry.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Total 2023 revenue was US$198.9 billion, down 7 per cent from 2022.\n\nPeople check out the iPhone 15 models on display at the Apple Store inside the IFC Mall in Central on September 22, 2023.

Photo: Xiaomei Chen>\n\nFoxconn on Friday blamed slow market demand for its static consumer electronics product business in the fourth quarter, even though the company went through a bumpy period a year ago when its biggest iPhone plant in Zhengzhou, capital of central Henan province was rocked by an exodus of tens of thousands of employees and violent workers' protests amid a Covid-19 outbreak that began in late October.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's dim first-quarter outlook reflects concerns raised by investors of major client Apple about sluggish iPhone sales, which prompted the US tech giant to be hit by two ratings downgrades this week.\n\n\"The iPhone 15 has been lacklustre and we believe iPhone 16 should be the same,\" Barclays analyst Tim Long said in a client note, which pointed to weakness in China and subdued demand in developed markets.\n\nShares of the technology giant fell 0.4 per cent on Friday to close at about US$181 after The New York Times reported that the US Justice Department is closer to filing an antitrust case against the company.\n\nApple, which has been the world's most valuable publicly-listed company since July 2022, has seen about US$177 billion in market value erased so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe company's iPhones also face intense competition on the mainland against a resurgent Huawei Technologies, which is seeing strong demand for its new 5G handsets in the world's largest smartphone market.\n\nWhile Apple continues to lead the global premium smartphone market, where handsets are priced from US$600, Huawei has gained ground in this segment on the back of its new Mate 60 series.\n\nFoxconn is also offering higher rates for workers that make Huawei's handsets in southern tech hub Shenzhen than those that make iPhones, according to a South China Morning Post report last September.\n\nStill, Foxconn has stepped up efforts to diversify its manufacturing supply chain for Apple and other clients amid the weak post-pandemic economic recovery in mainland China and rising geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\nFoxconn won approval to invest at least US$1 billion more in a plant it is building in India that will make Apple products, on top of the US$1.6 billion it earlier pledged, according to a report by Bloomberg last month.\n\nOn the mainland, Foxconn continues to invest in central Henan province, where it employs 200,000 workers in the firm's Zhengzhou manufacturing complex.\n\nThe Taiwanese firm, which was put under investigation in October by mainland regulators, this year plans to start building new factories for smartphones and other electronics products in the cities of Zhoukou, Kaifeng and Jiyuan in Henan, according to a list of 520 major construction projects for 2024 released this week by the province's Development and Reform Commission.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Can Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) Stay Magnificent Through 2024?",
        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the rest of the Magnificent Seven are off to a relatively slow start to 2024. Undoubtedly, the “Mag 7” has been referred to by some outlets as the “Lag 7,” a name I do not believe is warranted in the slightest. It’s only been one week of trading, after all. And though a weak start isn’t a great indicator of what’s to come for the rest of the year, I do think the stage could be set for continued gains going into year’s end.\n\nUndoubtedly, Microsoft stock is hardly the biggest laggard of the “Mag 7” cohort. The unenviable title of biggest 2024 laggard goes to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) so far, thanks to two untimely downgrades from big-name analysts on Wall Street.\n\nThough some investors may be inclined to think Apple, the world’s largest company, stands to drag down the rest of the market, I’m inclined to believe that AI-savvy firms, like Microsoft, have what it takes to roll with the punches and perhaps maintain its magnificence in the early innings of this mildly bearish start to the year. For this reason, I’m staying bullish on MSFT stock.\n\nMicrosoft: AI is Still the Name of the Game in 2024\n\nThrough 2023, Microsoft has stood tall, delivering AI news and innovations that investors applauded throughout the year. Indeed, Microsoft Copilot (the firm’s AI assistant) has proven quite useful. With new Windows PCs to sport the “Copilot” key, users have never been this close to a powerful generative AI.\n\nThis year, I believe Microsoft (and other tech firms) will try to remove even more friction between users and their generative AI platforms to help entice greater usage from those who would have otherwise gravitated toward a search engine.\n\nIndeed, it’s hard to break a habit of going straight to a search engine with one’s questions. Whether a physical button on new devices and the inclusion of Copilot on Windows operating systems change this remains to be seen. Personally, I believe a strong case can be made for the new Copilot button being as useful as the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) button on modern-day television remote controls.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn any case, don’t expect Microsoft to pull its foot off the AI gas in the new year.\n\nMicrosoft Stock: What About Its Valuation?\n\nThough the AI narrative has been priced in for a while now, I think there’s room for Microsoft to deliver a bit more in the way of surprises, especially when it comes to the actual numbers themselves. This year, we’ll get a glimpse of just how much AI can add to the bottom line and perhaps more guidance on what to expect over the longer term. The trillion-dollar question remains: can Microsoft grow into its swollen valuation with its impressive slate of AI tech and talent? Many analysts think it can.\n\nAt writing, shares of MSFT go for just shy of 36 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s a nearly 15% premium to the stock’s five-year historical average P/E of around 31.6 times. Given Microsoft’s AI edge, a premium is warranted. In my view, a premium north of 25% may not be all that absurd, given AI’s longer-term impact on the company’s bottom line.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill thinks Microsoft could continue to gain this year, with his price target of $450.00 entailing more than 22% upside from Friday’s close. Thill went as far as to say that Microsoft boasts the “best AI lineup in software.” I couldn’t agree more. Microsoft pretty much kicked off the AI frenzy a year ago, after all, with its stake in OpenAI and the advent of Bing AI.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, MSFT stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 37 analyst ratings, there are 36 Buys and one Hold recommendation. The average MSFT stock price target is $424.36, implying upside potential of 15.4%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $375.00 per share to a high of $600.00 per share.\n\nDespite last year’s magnificent gains (MSFT soared around 60%, outperforming the Nasdaq (NDX)), Microsoft still seems primed for even more upside. The highest price target of $600.00 (entailing more than 63% gains from current levels) comes courtesy of Truist Financial’s Joel Fishbein.\n\nIndeed, a lot needs to go right for Fishbein’s target to come true in 2024. As analysts rush to raise the bar on their price targets for the year, I don’t view the Street-high target as far-fetched in the slightest.\n\nThe Takeaway: MSFT Will Likely Stay Magnificent in 2024\n\nAs Microsoft continues adding to last year’s strengths, I expect it’s just a matter of time before the software giant snags the title of “world’s largest company by market cap” right out of Apple’s hands. Apple’s in a funk right now, with less clarity on its AI plans.\n\nFor Microsoft, it seems to have the clearest AI roadmap of the Magnificent Seven. And for that reason, I expect it to stay magnificent in 2024.\n\nDisclosure",

NYT Tech reporter David McCabe offers insight into the arguments of the impending lawsuit, namely \"how Apple keeps users inside its ecosystem and keeps competitors out.\"\n\nAt issue are strategies that leverage Apple's closed ecosystem to potentially impair rivals, rather than compete squarely on product merits. McCabe spotlights the Apple Watch's compatibility with iPhones, contrasting it with alternative smartwatches designed for connectivity across various devices and platforms.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: The New York Times is reporting the US government is nearing the end of a sweeping antitrust investigation into Apple. We're joined now by David McCabe, a reporter with the New York Times who broke the story. And David, you're keeping us busy on a Friday. Great story, David. Maybe just to start for viewers, David, maybe just walk us through the story. What is the Justice Department focused on here, David, when it comes to Apple?\n\nDAVID MCCABE: So thank you for having me. The Justice Department is in the late stages of an investigation into Apple's practices. It's been a pretty expansive investigation. And what agency officials are really focused on is the way that Apple keeps users inside its ecosystem and keeps competitors out with the iPhone at the center.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: And how is that happening? you know, what are some examples that the Justice Department might be focusing on, David-- it's Julie here, hi-- in terms of what it's looking into here?\n\nDAVID MCCABE: So we know that they're looking into, for example, the way that the Apple Watch, the smartwatch, works better with the iPhone than competing smartwatch brands. So if you look online, for example, you'll see that Garmin users have complained in Apple support forums about the fact that they can't necessarily reply to certain texts from their Garmin watch through their iPhone or see certain notifications or tweak their notification status. So they're looking at things like that that pair one Apple product with the iPhone.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey also appear to be looking at the payments ecosystem where Apple has built a pretty robust payments business through Apple Pay but has not offered the same access to its payment technology or chip technology to banks and financial services firms that might want to do the same.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And, David, I know, I read in your story, Apple declined to comment for your piece. But you also note that Apple has made this kind of reaction, this response in the past, right, basically saying, yes, we integrate the hardware, the services, the chips. And that's why our products work so well. That's why iPhone users are so loyal and satisfied, right?\n\nDAVID MCCABE: Yeah. I mean, they say that this ecosystem is a good thing. They've said in response to past criticism that they don't run afoul of antitrust law. And they've said that the smartphone market is competitive. And so, yes, they did decline to comment, but they've made it clear before that they think that criticisms that they're anti-competitive are off base.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: The European Commission has also focused on Apple, in particular has focused on the App Store and some of the other Apple services products. When we look at that situation, can we learn anything about, for example, how Apple might react or the effect on the business?\n\nDAVID MCCABE: Well, you know, I think broadly tech companies have pushed back very hard on the European efforts to regulate or police the companies. Apple is one of the companies that will have to comply with the Digital Markets Act. This is they're-- Europe's new antitrust regulation. And interestingly, one thing we reported is that the Department of Justice, the resolution of their investigation may hinge a bit on how Apple ultimately complies with that law. So I think one thing that we know for sure is that all of these regulatory efforts around the world are sort of interlinked together in the effect that they have.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, David, thank you so much for joining us to run us through the story here. We will keep our eyes out for more developments coming soon. Appreciate it.\n\nDAVID MCCABE: Thank you for having me.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the12 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin. For a quick overview of 5 such stocks, read our article 5 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nMarkets are off to a slow start in 2024 as investors go into a wait and see mode regarding the Fed’s plan of action for possible rate cuts this year. While the NASDAQ slid in the first few days of the year and some circles are voicing skepticism over the Magnificent Seven’s ability to carry forward the gains seen in 2023, long-term analysts believe technology stocks have more room to run in 2024. Part of the reason why many notable analysts are bullish on the technology sector is the power of AI and generative AI software’s benefits for common people.\n\nWhy Did Tech Stocks Decline in the Start of 2024?\n\nJosh Brown, CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, recently talked on CNBC about the reason behind the decline in tech stocks in the first week of 2024. Brown said that there is a lot of profit-taking activity going on right now as investors saw remarkable returns from the technology sector in 2023, especially in the fourth quarter of the year. Brown said that as a wealth manager he can totally understand the logic of taking profits early in the year especially after such a spectacular rally. Brown, however, emphasized that the decline in tech stocks might look like these companies are “stumbling” but that is not the case.\n\nJosh Brown also said that 2024 is the year when AI goes from “concept to product.” While he is not totally happy with their valuations,  Alphabet and Amazon are the top two tech stocks to own according to Brown because of their AI catalysts.\n\nWise investors know that a decline in stocks for a week or two or even a few months for that matter means nothing when seen in the long run. Tech companies working on products and services that impact millions of people around the world with strong balance sheets are expected to keep gaining momentum in the months and years to come. That’s why many analysts and money managers are piling into these stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at some of the top technology stock picks of billionaire Ken Griffin. Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Investment Group Methodology For this article we scanned Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel LLC's 13F portfolio for the third quarter of 2023 and picked the fund's top 12 technology stock picks. Some notable names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\n12. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $319M\n\nKen Griffin’s Citadel decreased its stake in ride-sharing platform company Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) by 11% in the third quarter. The fund still owns a $319 million stake in Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER).\n\nCiti analyst Ronald Josey added Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) to his top picks for 2024. Here is what the analyst said about these companies:\n\n“Underlying these themes are companies that, in our view, are stronger than they were a year ago. Most have gone through cost reductions and optimizations themselves resulting in sustainable margin expansion and stronger overall balance sheets.”\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was the top contributor in the quarter following a better-than-expected 2Q23 earnings report and 3Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $33.6 billion were up 16% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17 billion grew 25% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 12% from last year. 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $916 million, up $552 million year over year, significantly beat Street estimates of $845 million and the company generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Management guided to continuing growth in 3Q Gross Bookings (17%-20% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $975-1,025 million).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.3 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.4 billion of investments, the company’s enterprise value of $95 billion equates to just over 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”\n\n11. AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $319M\n\nAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) Inc. ranks 11th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Griffin’s fund increased its stake in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) by 182% in the third quarter, ending the quarter with a $319 million stake in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 52 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).\n\nMiller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.\n\nAT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”\n\n10. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $324M\n\nEven though Ken Griffin’s hedge fund cut its stake in social media platform company Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) by a whopping 53% in the third quarter, the fund still ended the period with a $324 million stake in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is enjoying a bullish view from analysts and hedge funds since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) successfully executed cost cutting and integrated AI in its products that led to huge usage growth.\n\nLike Meta, hedge funds are also buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nBlue Tower Asset Management made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On February 24, 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released Llama, their LLM project, with the code being open-source but the training weights being kept proprietary. Nonetheless, within a week the training weights were leaked for the project. This release of the weights for 65 billion parameter model was a huge gift for open-source programmers to begin experimenting upon. Within weeks, other developers were creating innovations building on the model. There has been a race towards developing low-budget fine-tuning projects that can be trained for specific applications at the cost of a few hundred dollars in some cases. Some of these LLM projects can even be run on individual computers rather than data centers.\n\nAfter the voluntary release of Llama’s architecture as open-source, the leak of the model weights ended up being a blessing in disguise for Meta. The innovation and improvements that followed were all built on Meta’s AI codebase. They were able to get these innovations without needing to pay any of the open-source developers for their efforts. This also demonstrates that the business advantage of the large tech companies is not in their models or AI codebase. Any innovations that the companies develop are unlikely to stay within the walls of the companies due to the mobility of researchers being poached between companies by recruiters. However, as these new model improvement technologies are made, the big tech companies have a scale advantage. They will be able to employ it into models that have more data, more compute budget, more parameters and therefore more intelligence in the resulting neural net.”\n\n9. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $355M\n\nDell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) ranks 9th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Citadel sold 818,057 shares of Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) during the third quarter. But the fund still owns a $355 million stake in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL).\n\nRecently, Citi opened a 90-day catalyst watch on Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) amid a bullish outlook of demand in the PC market.\n\n8. Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $399M\n\nKen Griffin’s hedge fund bought 122,566 more Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) shares during the third quarter, increasing its stake in the travel platform company to $399 million. The company is one of the best tech stocks to buy according to Ken Griffin.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) was Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $1.1 billion stake in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG).\n\nIn November, Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) posted Q3 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $72.32, beating estimates by $4.40. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 21.3% year over year to $7.34 billion, beating estimates by $80 million.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Following significant under-performance, some high-quality businesses in these sectors are now becoming more attractive from a valuation perspective – in our language they are now getting warmer on our Bench of potential investments.\n\nOur ‘all-weather’ portfolio centred around our unique definition of ‘quality’ delivered strong performance in the September quarter. Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Intuit and Natural Resource Partners, in alphabetical order), and another three companies almost reached this level of positive contribution. No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.\n\nAs part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.\n\nBooking Holdings, the world’s leading online travel agency, continues to benefit from a strong global travel environment with particular strength in Europe, Booking Holdings’ core market. Fears of peak ‘revenge travel’ following COVID-19 lockdowns have been misplaced in our view. We assess current travel volumes to be only slightly elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 trends, with some regions, particularly outbound travel from China, still relatively depressed. Anyone who has travelled anywhere recently will be nodding when we say hotel rates have increased meaningfully in recent times. Accommodation providers are generally doing quite well, but the increased hotel rates have been necessary to offset inflation in costs such as employee salaries and additional cleaning services. As Booking Holdings ‘clips the ticket’ of accommodation spend, the company has benefitted from increased average daily hotel rates. Importantly, Booking Holdings continues to invest in its business, improving the reach, quality and range of services it provides, resulting in gains in market share and an extension of its industry leadership position. Booking Holdings is now more fairly valued by the market, but still provides attractive base case risk-adjusted returns and remains one of the larger investments in the Fund.”\n\n7. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $552M\n\nMicron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the best technology stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. UBS recently called Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) one of its top semiconductor picks for 2024.\n\n\"Even after this rally into year-end, we would remain overweight semis in 2024 as inventory has peaked and started converting to revenue,\" UBS’s Timothy Arcuri said.\n\n6. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $563M\n\nCybersec company Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) ranks 6th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Citadel had a $563 million stake in Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) as of the end of September.\n\nRecently, Raymond James downgraded Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) stock to Market Perform from Outperform amid valuation concerns.\n\n\"To be clear, Palo Alto Networks is a great company, technology leader, execution has been stellar, and [Raymond James] doesn't fight investors that have a time horizon longer than its 12-month mandate. However, [Raymond James] believes the risk/reward in the stock is becoming less favorable,” Raymond James said.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Across the Information Technology universe, we seek companies possessing differentiated capabilities, products, and services. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) supplies network and cloud-based security solutions to enterprises, service providers, and government entities. The latest quarter was mixed with the company falling shy versus the Street on billings, in line for revenues, and outpacing earnings. Palo Alto’s updated guidance was materially ahead of lowered Street expectations. Nevertheless, its shares pulled back by -8%.”\n\nLike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Palo Alto is one of the stocks hedge funds are buying.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nKen Griffin Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates' Top 15 Dividend Stocks 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure.None. 12 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffinwas initially published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value",
        "content": "In 2023, an extraordinary phenomenon unfolded in the stock market: The Magnificent Seven, a group of top-tier stocks, experienced a remarkable surge in their value, ranging from a solid 50% gain to a staggering 240% climb.\n\nThis impressive performance catapulted them into the spotlight as some of the market's most lucrative investments.\n\nAmid this financial whirlwind, a particular focus has been placed on Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Savvy investors, delving into the nuanced world of financial metrics, have pointed out the company's forward price-earnings ratio is notably lower compared to its peers in the Magnificent Seven, raising concern.\n\nAlphabet's valuation portrays the market's anticipation of its future, influenced by pivotal factors such as the seismic shifts brought about by artificial intelligence-driven changes in online consumer behavior, Google's fluctuating share in the digital advertising market and the looming shadow of an antitrust lawsuit. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nDecoding market dynamics: How Google stands in the competitive landscape\n\nThe market attributes a higher price-earnings ratio to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), while Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) falls within a comparable range when juxtaposed with Alphabet.\n\nThe price-earnings ratio is not an arbitrary figure that an investor can assign to determine value, as it has implicit cash flow assumptions. A business that generates a high return on invested capital has more potential to drive growth in cash flow. A high ROIC indicates a company's superior profitability and efficiency in capital allocation. This distinction becomes evident when comparing Apple and Microsoft to Google and Meta.\n\nApple and Microsoft have consistently outperformed Google and Meta in terms of return on invested capital. Their last 10-year average ROICs stood at 25.90% and 16.6%, respectively, while Google and Meta's stood at 13% and 16.20%, respectively. As a result, the figures show the other three peer companies have outperformed Google in terms of profitability and capital efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the contrary, the other three companies in this group, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may not boast impressive ROIC, but their allure lies in higher growth potential, for which investors willingly pay a premium. Specifically, Nvidia and Tesla, being smaller in terms of revenue size, contribute to their distinct valuation dynamics. Meanwhile, Amazon consistently maintains a high price-earnings ratio due to investor optimism surrounding its expanding presence in the retail sector and dominance in the cloud business.\n\nHowever, the search giant's declining market share in digital ad revenue is generating concerns, introducing a nuanced landscape. Lastly, the increasing use cases of AI represent both an opportunity and a threat to its existing business model, while developments in anti-trust lawsuits add a layer of skepticism. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhat are the concerns for Alphabet that are embedded in the price-earnings multiple?\n\nAlphabet recently outperformed expectations for its quarterly performance, beating earnings per share estimates by 6%, rebounding from a slowdown experienced in previous quarters. However, apprehensions persist, particularly concerning Google's search and overall ad revenue business. Lastly, its search revenue accounts for approximately 57% of total revenue and around 73% of total advertising revenue. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhile you may consider it cyclical, the declining market share in digital ad revenue does pose a question of whether Alphabet is losing its long-established dominance in this space.\n\nMeta Platforms and Amazon continue to gain market share in the digital ad revenue market, while Google experiences a decline. Moreover, the way we retrieve information on the internet is changing. AI chatbots are supplanting many of the activities we traditionally performed on search engines. The company realizes the threat to search ad revenue, prompting it to actively address the challenge and make rapid strides in integrating AI across all its services. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: InsiderIntelligence.com\n\nThe recent launch of Gemini, a family of large language models by Google, seems exciting, as it can counter the threat of other LLMs like GPT-4, Claude and Llama. However, it still needs to solve the challenges in the existing business model, where search contributes the most to the business.\n\nAlphabet's cloud division has experienced impressive growth, yet it operates in a highly competitive landscape where Amazon and Microsoft dominate. Investors are dissatisfied with the recent slowdown in the growth of the cloud business, which decreased to 22.5% year over year during the third quarter from 37.6% a year prior.\n\nGoogle's legal battle and the future of search\n\nAlphabet's Google is under legal scrutiny amid allegations of employing questionable tactics to uphold its status as the world's foremost search engine. The U.S. Justice Department claims Google paid massive sums to companies like Apple to make it the default search engine on their devices. Google also admitted that it shares 36% of revenue with Apple for the search results on the iPhone. We could draw several scenarios from this lawsuit.\n\nThe first scenario is that Google wins the case and stays the default search engine on devices like iPhones, and their partnership with Apple remains the same.\n\nThere is another scenario that may go in favor of Google. If the DOJ compels Apple to display a choice screen where users can select their preferred search engine, a majority would likely choose Google, and the search giant would not have to pay anything to Apple.\n\nBut the worst-case scenario would be that Apple develops its own native search engine that would be the default for its Safari browser on all devices, and users would not have any choice.\n\nBeing a default search engine is a huge advantage because most people who put search queries on the browser address bar need to intuitively think about which search engine they post their queries in.\n\nSince Apple will be losing out on revenue from Google in this scenario, there is a possibility that it will try to come up with its own native search engine to recoup the lost revenue. Hence, this scenario could harm Google's search revenue as Safari, Apple's native browser, holds around 20% market share.\n\nWaymo's expansion and Wing's drone delivery partnership with Walmart\n\nGoogle's other bets include several projects. In the recent earnings call, the company mentioned Waymo (an autonomous driving technology company) onboarded more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually added over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist.\n\nAt the same time, Wing, a drone delivery service owned by Google, has unveiled a strategic collaboration with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to offer drone delivery services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nWhile these developments are exciting, they have yet to reach a level of significance that would substantially impact the company's financials or long-term potential.\n\nFurther, in the age of AI, how we retrieve information online is changing. While Google is responding to these changes, its predominant business model, centered around search engine queries, faces potential risks stemming from shifts in how users consume information.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a new digital era, the shift from traditional search engines to AI-driven chatbots marks a pivotal change in consumer behavior. The relentless advancement of LLMs is poised to revolutionize how we seek information, potentially rendering traditional search queries obsolete. This evolution raises critical questions about the future of advertising in an AI-dominated landscape.\n\nWhile the full extent of these changes remains shrouded in the mists of the future, their potential impact on giants like Alphabet cannot be underestimated. For investors, concerns over these AI-induced shifts challenging the company's dominance in search revenue are justified and crucial in navigating the uncertain waters of technological progression.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "EU Antitrust Chief Margrethe Vestager will meet with chief executives of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and OpenAI in Palo Alto and San Francisco next week to discuss digital regulation and antitrust policies.\n\nAxios Global Tech Correspondent Ryan Heath joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into what to expect from the meetings and potential outcomes from the meetings for these companies.\n\n\"They [Big Tech] have come to realize the EU isn't going away. They don't particularly like the way the EU approaches regulation, but they know that it's a very lucrative market, and it makes more sense to play ball with them at some level,\" Heath explains. \"There's this constant tension between how do they give a little bit to the EU, look cooperative, but at the same time, don't do anything to cannibalize their business.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager announcing she will now meet with chief execs from key tech giants next week, including leaders from Apple, NVIDIA, alphabet, and Broadcom. For more on this, we turn to Ryan Heath, Axios Global tech correspondent.\n\nThank you for joining us this morning, Ryan. So we know that the EU has really been taking the lead here on framing an AI framework here. What are the expectations for this trip?\n\nRYAN HEATH: Well, it's a doublE-hatted trip actually. So yes, the EU has locked down its new AI Act. But the big thing there is it's actually not going to be enforced for another year for the first half. And the second half, it's going to be two years before they start implementing it. But the way regulators work, obviously, is playing catch up to markets a lot of the time. So the previous big piece of legislation, which is about trying to limit the power of big tech gatekeepers. That's really coming into force from March this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo Vestager is going to be here previewing the AI Act, but also a little bit reading the Riot Act about this digital markets legislation, which is really trying to make sure that the big companies run open ecosystems. They don't try and lock you into their app stores. They don't preference their own systems. So she's going to go around these companies one by one. And work through how they're going to relate on this legislation together.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And Ryan, how do you think this is going to be received? Because they're really being perceived as gatekeepers here, but they also want to be at the really at the forefront of some of the legislation, as well. How do you balance that?\n\nRYAN HEATH: Yeah. It's really tricky. So the companies have a very different attitude to 10 or 20 years ago. And some of them are very new too. So they've only ever known this very aggressive European Union. But I think the Googles of the world, the Metas, the Apples, they've come to realize the EU isn't going away. They don't particularly like the way the EU approaches regulation. But they know that it's a very lucrative market. And it makes more sense to play ball with them at some level.\n\nSo there's this constant tension between how do they give a little bit to the EU, look cooperative, but at the same time, don't do anything to cannibalize their business. And that's the constant back and forth between the companies and people like Vestager. And she's back in the hot seat now because she was running for a new position to be head of the European Investment Bank. And she lost out. So now, she's coming back with her tail a little bit between her legs. And she's got one year left to secure her legacy and make a difference.\n\nSo you might see a slightly fine tuned Vestager in these meetings as well.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So are we expecting her to really try and make her mark here, or really try and do what it takes to really get some results here? As you said, because the legislation isn't supposed to kick in for another year.\n\nRYAN HEATH: Yeah. I think she's really got to try and secure some results. She's a pragmatist at the end of the day. She said fairly radical and ambitious goals. And then she puts her head down and tries to find pragmatic ways to get some of the way there. And now, she's really into that tail end of her time in Brussels. And she's had a few defeats in big court cases over the past 12 and 18 months. So it's really time to show some results. It's not enough to just wave a piece of legislation around. She's got to actually make a difference in how these companies operate and how the market itself is structured.\n\nAnd so I think there's going to be a lot of that pragmatism on show during this visit.",

        "title": "Microsoft closes in on Apple's 'most valuable company' title",
        "content": "The fight is on in 2024's first trading week as Microsoft (MSFT) dukes it out with Apple for the title of most valuable US company. The tech giants' market caps are neck following two analyst downgrades to the iPhone maker's stock this week.\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jared Blikre observes the two tech companies, also discussing Apple's prior history of annual sales growth.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, Microsoft is about $100 billion away from overtaking Apple as the most valuable company in the US. This comes after two analysts downgraded Apple this week. \"Yahoo Finance's\" own Jared Blikre is here to break it down for us. The battle of the tech giants, Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes. And Thank. You for the introduction there. Here is a market cap over the last five years of these two giant companies. And by the way, they're very different companies. But we can compare them. Apple is in purple here. It's currently on top. And here is its $3 trillion plus peak. And here is Microsoft in cyan, just a little bit lower right now. But you can see Microsoft, at times, over the last five years has led Apple for brief periods of time, including coming out of those pandemic lows.\n\nBut really you go back 10, 20, 30, 40 years and you can really see the difference between those two companies. I'm going to compare now the stock prices of these two companies over the last 10 years. You can see Apple's up 842%. Microsoft is up 904%. So neck and neck right there with Microsoft a slight edge.\n\nYou look at the 20-year chart. What happened? Apple's up 45,000%. Microsoft up 1,200%. I think a lot of investors would take that. But essentially, if you had to buy 2008 to 2010 to reach any comparable number with Apple, and if you got in between 2000 and 2008, that was dead money. That was a losing trade. And that's because in the wake of the tech bubble, and also the antitrust suit that Microsoft was facing 20 years ago, it just became dead money for about a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet me now show you the story in terms of sales growth. This is Apple sales growth going back into the late '90s. This is when Steve Jobs took over. And let's not forget, Apple was left for dead, almost went bankrupt. How about that? But this incredible years-- these years of sales growth here, a lot of them topping 75%. That's the iPod. And then that's the iPhone. And you can see things have trailed off. The services side of the equation has gotten a lot of play here, but it doesn't always live up to expectations.\n\nRight now, four quarters of declining revenue growth. That is a negative situation for Apple. Expectations are for that to be broken. But we'll have to see how this plays out in earnings season. Give it another month.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Looking forward to that. Our very own Jared Blikre. Thank you so much.",

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently trimmed by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.\n\nIn 2023, U.S. bankruptcy filings experienced a notable 18% surge, reaching a total of 445,186, driven by a confluence of factors such as higher interest rates, more stringent lending standards, and the gradual phasing out of pandemic-era support measures. Data from bankruptcy data provider Epiq AACER revealed that both commercial Chapter 11 reorganization filings and consumer filings contributed to this increase, rising by 72% to 6,569 and 18% to 419,55, respectively. While December saw a slight dip in total filings to 34,447 from November, a year-on-year increase of 16% was still evident, signaling the persistence of financial challenges for individuals and businesses. Looking ahead to 2024, the trajectory of bankruptcy cases is expected to continue its upward trend. Despite this, the figures remain below the peak observed in 2019, the year preceding the onset of the pandemic, when 757,816 bankruptcies were filed. Michael Hunter, Vice President of Epiq AACER, anticipates that the rise in both consumer and commercial filings seeking bankruptcy protection will persist in 2024. Contributing factors include the diminishing effects of pandemic stimulus, a higher cost of funds, increased interest rates, growing delinquency rates, and historically high levels of household debt. The financial landscape, tightened by the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes over the past two years, showed some easing in the fourth quarter of 2023 following signals of the Fed concluding its rate-hike cycle. Moreover, recent indications from Fed officials suggest an expectation of rate cuts in the upcoming year.\n\nBond prices declined on January 4 following positive jobs data, leading to skepticism about the Federal Reserve's timing and extent of potential interest rate cuts. Technology stocks, particularly in the Nasdaq 100, faced instability, contributing to the index's potential prolonged losing streak, reported Bloomberg. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a dip after its second downgrade in the week, with Piper Sandler expressing worries about iPhone inventory levels. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 saw a slight uptick, recovering from a three-day selloff in the preceding session. Oil prices surged due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, adding another layer of market volatility. Against this backdrop, CreditSights' Zeng shared insights on China Tech's credit outlook, offering perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in the sector. In summary, the markets experienced fluctuations as positive job data raised questions about potential Fed actions, impacting bond prices and tech stocks. Specific concerns about Apple's inventory levels added to the tech sector's challenges. The S&P 500 showed modest gains, while oil prices reacted to geopolitical tensions. Additionally, insights on China Tech's credit outlook were provided to navigate the complex landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeekly U.S. jobless claims have hit a two-month low, decreasing by 18,000 to 202,000, indicating a gradually easing labor market. Continuing claims also dropped by 31,000 to 1.855 million. According to Reuters, despite a slight increase in the total number of Americans on jobless rolls, economists believe the economy is not heading toward a recession. The labor market, cooling after Federal Reserve interest rate hikes since March 2022, has a resilient unemployment rate below 4%. Financial markets anticipate potential interest rate cuts in March based on recent central bank meeting minutes, which express concerns about an abrupt downturn if labor demand weakens. Despite low layoffs in December, planned layoffs for 2023 surged to 721,677, the highest since 2020. The claims data will not impact the upcoming Labor Department's December employment report, where nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by 170,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate is forecasted to increase to 3.8%. Private payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs in December, according to the ADP National Employment Report, though its reliability in predicting the Labor Department's count is uncertain. Continuing claims serve as a proxy for hiring but have faced difficulties in adjusting for seasonal fluctuations. Economists anticipate revisions to address these distortions.\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) by trimming their price targets.

However, with a Piotroski F-Score of 6 and an Altman Z-Score of 0.92, the company's financial stability and profitability are evident, albeit with some caution due to its low cash to debt ratio of 0.03. These factors will play a crucial role in determining the stock's future performance potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent investment in Liberty SiriusXM Group is a testament to Berkshire Hathaway's strategy of identifying companies with strong long-term growth prospects.

        "content": "Foxconn (2354.TW), best known for assembling Apple's iPhone (AAPL), reported revenue declined in both December and fourth quarter as a whole. The company also warned it expects a year-over-year revenue decline in the first quarter as well. Foxconn noted \"slower market demand\" for its smart consumer products in the fourth quarter. That echoes the comments of two Apple analysts who downgraded the stock this week on iPhone demand concerns. Yahoo Finance Live discusses the report and what it could mean for other Apple suppliers.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right. Let's get to another mover, a top trender here at \"Yahoo Finance.\" Apple supplier Foxconn. Apple moving to buy Apple supplier Foxconn seeing sales declines again in December. Falling over 5% year-over-year. It isn't predicting a turnaround in the current quarter.\n\nThe data raising some concerns about demand for the newest iPhone model. Something that we have heard about a number of times over the last several weeks. But in particular, this week when we got the downgrades here from two analysts on the Street started by Barclays earlier this week, when they cut their rating to underweight. But what all this means here for some of these suppliers who rely so heavily on Apple's iPhone sales. We're continuing to see some of that pressure here.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, one of those names here, Myles, that has been under a bit of pressure this week considering the fact that it gets about a fifth of its annual revenue from Apple. So we're seeing pressure once again on Apple. And once again, some of Apple's critical suppliers falling as well.\n\nMYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And the classic names for US investors really focused on the derivative Apple Play, let's say. Skyworks, Corvo, a couple of names that have been down closer to 9%, over 9% over the same five-day period, where we've seen shares of Apple fall 6%. So I think it is a reminder that when Apple sneezes, others catch a cold, to use that old cliche. And we see that here, once again, with these names.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut I think the question for the overall Apple ecosystem is no one doubts that they're going to continue to sell millions and millions of iPhones. And that they're going to continue to be the dominant player, at least, in the US market in terms of handset share. And I know we're going to get into this, as we get towards their earnings report at the end of this month. It might be the beginning of February, when we have Dan Howley back on set. But it comes down to what's the hardware innovation timeline for them.\n\nWe know that the headset is really the main driver in terms of hype like a new piece of equipment for Apple people to get-- Apple consumers, and, of course, the Apple fans to get really excited about, as we get into this year. We've seen the services business continue to be the main driver in terms of revenue growth. Though, it's a smaller overall line item on that top line, it grows faster than the other segments.\n\nWe had the watch problems at the end of last year. I know they've found some interim solutions to that, but are they creating a new business line around AirPods? I think AirPod Max have been somewhat disappointing. Mine are fine. They fit OK. But I think what they've done with the Beats business. There are a bunch of different questions here just around like your Apple stuff. And this gets into like the old, what do I know thing.\n\nEvery iPhone is the same. But I'm just a guy. And I think that just the guy is the majority of Apple consumers.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly.\n\nMYLES UDLAND: And that my defense of me.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Well, it's a bit-- it's not too far off from what the argument was from Tim Long there at Barclays just in terms of the fact that there's not a heck a lot of excitement about the iPhone 15. We certainly did not see the number of crowds or the number of sales, at least, expected that we had initially hoped for, many investors had initially hoped for going into this launch.\n\nAnd then he also brought up the fact that looking ahead to the iPhone 16, at least, from his checks. He doesn't anticipate it to be a heck of a lot different than the reception that we're seeing this time around for the latest model. So taking all of that into account, the fact that it's still so reliant on this one piece of hardware. Yes, they are diversifying their business. But the fact that it is still so reliant clearly a headwind, at least, in the immediate term, when you take into account the valuation in the run up that we see in the stock.\n\nMYLES UDLAND: Yeah. And look, biggest company in the market. That's why we talk about it all the time.\n\nSEANA SMITH: It is.",

That has shrunk its lead over fellow technology juggernaut Microsoft Corp. — whose shares have seen a less pronounced decline to begin the year — to less than $100 billion.\n\nApple’s shares, which rallied nearly 50% last year, have fallen in every session to start 2024, on track to wipe off about $183 billion in market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the stock has suffered bigger percentage declines in the first week of January, this is its biggest market value destruction at the start of any year on record.\n\nApple fell 0.7% in premarket trading on Friday, pushing its market value down to $2.81 trillion, nearing Microsoft’s $2.73 trillion. If premarket losses hold, the stock will fall for its fifth consecutive session, its longest losing streak since October.\n\nMeanwhile, the Windows software maker has benefitted from the artificial intelligence trade that has mesmerized Wall Street over the past year.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The market recovered in 2023 following a sharp decline in 2022, driven by excitement about artificial intelligence and an improving forecast for interest rates. The strategy underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 Index, in the fourth quarter. The strategy gained from eleven sectors it invested during the quarter on an absolute basis. Sector allocation detracted, while stock selection contributed positively on a relative basis. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy featured stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational technology company that designs and manufactures smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. On January 4, 2024, Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has a market capitalization of $2.866 trillion.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"We meaningfully reduced our exposure to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2023. Apple is the largest company in the world and produces terrific products that engage users for hours each day. Despite the company’s size, ubiquity and relevance, however, Apple’s growth has slowed dramatically. Its fiscal 2023 earnings were flat with those of 2022. Apple trades at 30x earnings; sustaining that multiple will require a meaningful acceleration in revenues. While such an improvement is possible, we do not see any obvious catalysts for adding tens of billions of dollars to Apple’s topline. Consequently, the risk-reward skews negatively.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in 10th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy: Apple vs. Alibaba",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) are both often considered stable blue-chip plays for long-term investors. Apple's iPhone dominates the premium smartphone market, and its other hardware devices and sticky software services continuously lock in its customers. Alibaba is China's largest e-commerce and cloud company, and it also owns one of the country's largest streaming video platforms.\n\nBut over the past six months, Apple's stock dipped 4% as Alibaba's stock dropped 9%. Let's see why these two stalwarts floundered, and if either stock is worth buying right now. Image source: Apple.\n\nWhat happened to Apple?\n\nApple is still overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone, which accounted for 52% of its revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September). Its iPhone sales declined 2% during the year as the 5G upgrade cycle ended, and that slowdown was exacerbated by its plunging sales of Macs in a post-pandemic market and tough currency headwinds.\n\nAs a result, Apple's revenue dipped 3% as its earnings per share (EPS) stayed nearly flat. It tread water by repurchasing $77.6 billion in shares throughout the year, but analysts expect the market's demand for its iPhones to remain tepid this year. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 4% and 8%, respectively, in fiscal 2024, but those growth rates are arguably low for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings.\n\nOn the bright side, Apple still ended the year with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities, which gives it plenty of room to expand through new investments and acquisitions. It also exceeded a billion paid subscriptions across all of its services, which was nearly double the number it had just three years ago.\n\nThat expanding ecosystem should lock in its customers. Its planned launch of the Vision Pro headset this year could also diversify its hardware business and give it a foothold in the nascent augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple still has a lot of irons in the fire, but its lack of visible near-term catalysts and stretched valuations seem to be weighing down its stock. Nevertheless, Warren Buffett is still committed to keeping nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in Apple -- so it might still be a long-term winner.\n\nWhat happened to Alibaba?\n\nBuffett's longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, invested heavily in Alibaba through the Daily Journal in 2021. However, Munger eventually reduced that stake, and called it one of the \"worst mistakes\" of his career. Munger, like many other value-seeking investors, was initially drawn to Alibaba's low valuations. Unfortunately, Alibaba's stock became dirt cheap for three obvious reasons.\n\nFirst, China's antitrust regulators hit Alibaba with a record fine of $2.8 billion in September 2021 and forced it to end its exclusive deals with merchants, ease off its aggressive promotions, and request government approvals for its future acquisitions. Those new restrictions eroded Alibaba's defenses against JD.com, PDD Holdings, and other formidable e-commerce competitors.\n\nSecond, China's economy cooled off as the macro headwinds intensified. That slowdown was exacerbated by the country's draconian COVID-19 lockdowns throughout 2021 and 2022.\n\nLastly, the macro headwinds throttled the growth of its cloud business as companies reined in their software spending. That's why Alibaba's revenue rose a mere 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last March) as its adjusted earnings per ADS grew 4%.\n\nBut looking ahead, analysts expect Alibaba's revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 11% and 22%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as China's macro environment stabilizes. However, the recent departure of its longtime CEO, its confusing restructuring plans (which might lead to spin-offs and IPOs for its individual business units), and intense competition from PDD in China suggest its high-growth days are over. On the other hand, Alibaba still repurchased $15.7 billion in ADR shares throughout fiscal 2023 and the first half of fiscal 2024, and its low forward P/E multiple of 8 might just set a floor under its stock.\n\nThe better buy: Apple\n\nAlibaba looks cheap relative to its growth potential, but its future is still murky and the delisting threats for U.S.-listed Chinese stocks could depress its valuations for the foreseeable future. The tightening restrictions for AI chip sales to China could also disrupt the expansion of its cloud infrastructure platform.\n\nApple's stock might remain out of favor in this tough market, but its stable growth, expanding ecosystem, and massive war chest arguably make it a better buy than Alibaba, which still needs to overcome some tough macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges before it can be considered an undervalued growth stock again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 FAANG Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Over multidecade periods, Wall Street has proved to be a bona fide wealth-creating machine. But over shorter timelines, such as a few months or a couple of years, directional moves in the major stock indexes can be unpredictable.\n\nFor the past decade, when the going has gotten tough on Wall Street, investors have turned to the time-tested FAANG stocks.\n\nBy \"FAANG,\" I'm talking about:\n\nFacebook, which is now a subsidiary of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from absolutely crushing the broader market in the return department over the trailing decade, these five companies dominate their respective industries.\n\nMeta Platforms owns some of the top social media \"real estate\" on the planet and attracted nearly 4 billion active users to its sites each month during the September-ended quarter. Apple's iPhone accounts for better than 50% of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, its share repurchase program over the past decade is unmatched by any public company. Nearly 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022 can be traced to Amazon's online marketplace. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is also the world's top cloud infrastructure service provider by spending. Netflix is both the domestic and international market share leader in streaming services. Further, no streaming company comes close to matching its library of original content. Alphabet's Google is pretty much a monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in December.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the FAANGs could differ dramatically in the new year. While two of these outperformers remain historically inexpensive and are ripe for the picking, another industry leader has seen its growth engine stall.\n\nFAANG stock No. 1 to buy hand over fist in 2024: Meta Platforms\n\nDespite shares nearly tripling in 2023, social media stock Meta Platforms stands out as a clear-cut value play in the new year (and beyond).\n\nStory continues\n\nArguably, the biggest risk for Meta is the possibility of the U.S. falling into a recession in 2024. A couple of money-focused metrics and forecasting tools with exemplary track records do suggest a challenging year lies ahead. Since Meta generates more than 98% of its revenue from advertising and businesses are typically quick to pare back their ad spending in a weakening economy, this would be bad news for the company.\n\nThe thing about recessions that's often overlooked is just how short-lived they typically are. Nine of the 12 recessions following World War II haven't lasted a year, while none of the remaining three made it past 18 months. By comparison, there have been two economic expansions that endured at least a full decade since 1945. More often than not, ad-driven companies are enjoying a favorable economic climate.\n\nWhat really puts the ball in Meta's court is its aforementioned social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site globally, while Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are, collectively, among the most-downloaded apps worldwide. In spite of seemingly endless competition, Meta's social media apps continue to shine and draw in a greater number of monthly active users. That's great news for its ad-pricing power.\n\nInvestors should also consider that Meta's mammoth operating cash flow and cash-rich balance sheet give it the luxury of investing in high-growth initiatives. Though its augmented/virtual reality segment, Reality Labs, has lost nearly $11.5 billion through the first nine months of 2023, its family of apps has generated $41.8 billion in profit. Meta is also sitting on more than $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. CEO Mark Zuckerberg can make investments for the future without hurting his company's bread-and-butter operating segment.\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms remains historically cheap after its big run-up. Shares can be purchased for 11.8 times forward-year cash flow, which is 25% below Meta's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing five years.\n\nFAANG stock No. 2 to buy hand over fist in 2024: Alphabet\n\nThe other FAANG stock investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024 is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nNot to sound like a broken record, but Alphabet shares the same biggest concern as Meta Platforms: a potential slowdown in advertising. Alphabet brought in about 78% of its revenue during the third quarter from advertising. If the U.S. economy slows down in the new year, it's probable that businesses would taper their ad spending -- at least in the short run.\n\nWhat Alphabet has working in its favor is its practical monopoly status in global internet search. According to monthly search share data provided by GlobalStats, the last time Google closed out a month with less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search was March 2015. It's the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to reach consumers, which should propel strong ad-pricing power for parent company Alphabet.\n\nHowever, it's the company's ancillary operating segments that represent its most-intriguing growth prospects in 2024 (and beyond). In particular, cloud infrastructure service provider Google Cloud has turned the corner to recurring profitability. Enterprise cloud spending has a long growth runway, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, as of the September-ended quarter.\n\nYouTube is no slouch, either. It's attracting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, which trails only Facebook, and has seen daily views of Shorts (short-form videos that typically last less than a minute) shoot past 50 billion. Both premium subscriptions and advertising demand should increase in the new year.\n\nBest of all, Alphabet remains inexpensive. Shares can be purchased for 14.4 times forward-year cash flow to begin 2024. That's a notable discount to its average cash flow multiple of 18 over the previous five years. Image source: Apple.\n\nThe FAANG stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Apple\n\nUnfortunately, not every FAANG stock is poised to be a winner in 2024. Although tech stock Apple has been one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the past 20 years, it's not a company I'd suggest putting money to work in this year.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- Apple is a pretty phenomenal business. As noted, it accounts for half or more of U.S. smartphone market share. Further, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the evolution of Apple into a platforms-focused company. An operating model that emphasizes subscription services should lift Apple's operating margin over time, as well as alleviate some of the wild revenue swings that usually accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nBut it's not about where Apple has been so much as where it's going. Right now, Apple isn't going anywhere. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple reported an $11 billion (2.8%) year-over-year decline in sales. Though its services segment generated 9% sales growth for the fiscal year, every physical product division saw sales decline -- iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Wearables.\n\nWhat makes this underperformance even more eye-popping is that it occurred with above-average inflation as a tailwind. Apple is one of the best-known and most-trusted brands on the planet. The fact that it wasn't able to raise its prices enough to lift its sales with above-average inflation demonstrates how weak organic demand was for its physical products in fiscal 2023.\n\nTo add to this, while Apple was able to avoid a decline in year-over-year earnings per share thanks to its incredible share repurchase program, net income did decline from $99.8 billion to $97 billion. In other words, buybacks appear to be the only thing really saving Apple stock from a meltdown at this point.\n\nHistorically, investors have had no qualms paying an aggressive multiple to own shares of Apple if the company is growing by a double-digit rate. But with a negative real-growth rate, Apple stock is highly unattractive at 27 times forward-year earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Stock futures in New York tick lower as investors gear up for the release of the closely-watched U.S. jobs report for December. Economists are projecting that nonfarm payrolls were less than the prior month, although recent data has pointed to resilience in labor demand that could boost the Federal Reserve's bid to engineer a soft landing for the world's largest economy.\n\n1. Nonfarm payrolls ahead\n\nThe American economy is expected to have added fewer jobs in December versus the prior month, but is still seen rising at a solid rate.\n\nEconomists estimate that U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 170,000 last month, down from 199,000 in November. Average hourly earnings are projected to have increased at a monthly pace of 0.3%, decelerating marginally from the previous reading of 0.4%. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, is anticipated to come in at 3.8%, up from 3.7%.\n\nA string of data earlier this week has pointed to a resilient jobs picture. Hiring by private employers in December far outpaced expectations and job openings fell to an almost three-year low.\n\nEven still, labor demand has begun to show some signs of steadily easing under the strain of an unprecedented policy tightening campaign by the Fed that has brought rates up to 22-year highs. But if the slowdown remains gradual, it bodes well for a so-called \"soft landing\" -- a scenario in which the Federal Reserve manages to defeat inflation without causing a collapse in the broader economy.\n\n2. Futures inch lower\n\nU.S. stock futures pointed into the red on Friday, with investors preparing for the release of the all-important jobs report.\n\nBy 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT), the Dow futures contract had dipped by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had shed 11 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had lost 47 points or 0.3%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 retreated by 0.3% in Thursday's trading session and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.6%, as a downbeat opening to the new year continued on Wall Street. Out of the three major averages, only the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average closed in positive territory, edging up by 0.03% thanks in part to a solid performance in financial stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDenting sentiment has been ebbing hopes that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts in early 2024. Despite releasing an outlook for rates that was more dovish than prior projections last month, Fed minutes published this week suggested that policymakers believe borrowing costs could remain elevated \"for some time.\"\n\n3. Gold on pace for weekly decline as dollar gains\n\nGold prices dipped in European trade on Friday after sinking below key levels this week, while the dollar surged.\n\nThe yellow metal was nursing some losses for the week following a rally near the end of 2023. But the gains faltered as investors looked to take profits and uncertainty grew over the Fed’s rate plans.\n\nSpot gold slid 0.3% to $2,037.79 per troy ounce, while gold futures fell 0.3% to $2,044.25 a troy ounce by 05:09 ET. Both instruments were down between 0.8% to 1% this week.\n\nRecent bets that rate cuts could begin by as soon as March 2024 have been scaled back, spurring on a rise in the dollar. The greenback is on track for an over 1% weekly gain -- its best since July 2023.\n\n\"The start of the year has poured a little cold water on that kind of optimism [over March rate reductions], and our team retains a view that the first cut will come in May,\" analysts at ING said in a note.\n\n4. Crude on course for weekly increase\n\nOil prices moved higher on Friday, driven in part by concerns over potential supply disruptions caused by recent unrest in the Middle East.\n\nBy 05:09 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.0% higher at $72.92 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.8% to $78.19 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks are on course to end the first week of the year around 1% higher. Attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis on shipping vessels in the Red Sea have fueled worries over the flow of supplies through a crucial trade artery between Europe and Asia.\n\nBut gains have been limited by data showing a massive build in U.S. oil product inventories in the final week of 2023. The reading indicated that demand remained weak in the world’s largest oil consumer.\n\n5. Apple supplier Foxconn warns of Q1 revenue drop\n\nFoxconn, a major assembler of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship iPhone smartphone, warned that it anticipates a year-on-year decline in first quarter revenue, following weaker demand in the previous three-month period.\n\nIn a statement, the Taiwan-based group -- formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd -- said that the top-line figure for the first quarter faced a tough comparison with the initial three months of the prior year, when revenue was boosted by the post-COVID resumption of normal factory activity. The company did not provide specific numerical guidance.\n\nThe announcement comes after sluggish customer demand led to \"flattish\" annual fourth-quarter revenue at Foxconn's smart consumer electronics division, which includes handsets.\n\nFears over demand for iPhones have led to two analysts downgrades of Apple's stock this week, hitting the tech giant's shares. However, Apple remains the world's most valuable company by market value.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNonfarm payrolls ahead, U.S. futures tick lower - what's moving markets\n\nCanadian dollar forecasts raised by analysts banking on Fed rate cuts: Reuters poll\n\nInvestors flee to US money market funds on caution as rate cut optimism cools",

        "content": "Megatrends will continue to develop, creating incredible opportunities. Here are seven of the top megatrend stocks that are capitalizing on one or more powerful trends you shouldn’t avoid. I’ll be talking about fintech, e-commerce, emerging economies, the rise of India, and the true beginning of the metaverse. That’s not an exhaustive list of current megatrend stocks, but it’s a good start.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top megatrend stocks to consider is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). As one of the fastest-growing e-commerce companies in the world, it’s been compared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The only difference is that MELI serves the Latin American market. So, right off the bat, MercadoLibre touches on e-commerce, fintech, and rising interest in emerging economies.\n\nThe primary reason an investor should consider investing in any company is for its fundamentals. Fortunately, Mercado Libre is very strong fundamentally. The growth metrics underpinning the firm are very, very strong. For example, in the third quarter, revenues increased by 69.1% reaching $3.8 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTotal payment volume grew by 121.3%, growing to $47.3 billion. In addition, it’s abundantly clear that MercadoLibre’s fintech payments system, Mercado Pago, is growing incredibly fast.\n\nSify Technologies (SIFY) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nNext up is Sify Technologies (NASDAQ:SIFY). The reason I wanted to focus on Sify is that India is becoming much more important to the global economy. The country is one of the fastest growing in the world, clocking an annual GDP growth rate of 5.5%. Better, India is expected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2027.\n\nThe company grew by 11% in the most recent quarter and continues to be profitable, although decreasingly so. India continues to be noted for its burgeoning IT sector. So investors should expect companies like Sify Technologies to increasingly gain exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a big year for megatrend stocks, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). For one, Apple is set to release its Vision Pro augmented/virtual reality headset in late January or early February.  The first wave of Vision Pros should be shipped in about a month. It’s also expected that the company will ship roughly 500,000 headsets in 2024.\n\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, isn’t expected to have a large impact on Apple financially. Remember, Apple sells roughly 200 million iPhones per year so the Vision Pro isn’t particularly important from a fiscal perspective. However, it is important in that it will propel Apple farther into the metaverse. It simply gives investors another reason to consider Apple which has a track record of releasing viral products that the world is very quick to adopt en masse.\n\nGrab Holdings (GRAB) Motorcycle helmet with Grab logo on a motorcycle parked at the road side\n\nSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) is a mega app serving a diverse base of customers across a handful of emerging Southeast Asian growth economies. The stock hits on a few important megatrends, specifically the emergence of Southeast Asia and emerging technologies overall.\n\nWhen I say emerging technologies, I’m referring to Grab Holdings and its development of a super app that places a huge variety of services at users’ fingertips. The company’s app allows a user to hail a taxi, get food delivered, pay for services, get insurance, and access telemedicine among other things.\n\nInvestors continue to be interested in Grab Holdings because the company is located in Singapore, one of the world’s great financial hubs. further, Singapore is centrally located and provides close access to burgeoning Southeast Asian economies that continue to gain attention. As the world’s mega powers continue to deal with difficulties of their own investors are increasingly looking to untapped markets to satisfy their desire for growth. Southeast Asia is full of such potential.\n\n2024 is going to be marked by quantitative easing which will make Grab Holdings’ losses look less important and its 61% revenue growth look that much more attractive.\n\nAdyen (ADYEY) undervalued fintech stocks A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word \"Fintech,\" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth. Fintech Stock Bargains, fintech stock\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdyen (OTCMKTS:ADYEY) Is a leading fintech stock and a company capitalizing on a global shift in payments. It’s another one of the top megatrend stocks you may want to consider.\n\nBrick-and-mortar retail is fading as e-commerce continues to grow. Likewise, cash is beginning to take a back seat to digitized payments. These shifts are broadly called fintech which is the emergence of new payment systems.\n\nAdd Yin is also one of the leading firms in the unified payments space. The unified payments space refers to the idea that all of your various digital payments can be unified into a single swipe, for example. The company saw a 25% increase in its unified payments volume in the third quarter. Revenues increased by 22%, reaching 413.6 million euros.\n\nA report from McKinsey pegged fintech growth between 2022 and 2028 at 15% annually. The payment space will continue to provide strong growth opportunities for investors in the years to come.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen.

The company famously changed its stock name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in late 2021 signaling a larger shift.\n\nThen things rapidly unraveled as the realities of 2022 set in. The era of pandemic largess, stimulus payments, and runaway inflation was over. A period of fiscal conservatism marked by a series of rapid decreases in the federal funds rate resulted in a rapid decline in the company’s share price.\n\nTo be clear, Meta Platforms 2022 troubles were a consequence of declining ad revenues much more than its choice to rebrand. Ad revenues from its family of apps segment continue to drive the business and its results. So, META stock is more a macroeconomic story than it is a metaverse story if you follow my message. Revenues are again strong as the economy continues to show signs of strength, resulting in 23% top line growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to run the advertising that shows real utilitarian development of its metaphors applications. The company is in position to see some real returns from what once looked like a crazy investment.\n\nFiverr (FVRR) The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: Temitiman / Shutterstock.com\n\nFiverr (NYSE:FVRR) is a solid stock to consider for investors looking to capitalize on seismic shifts in labor. The company has successfully developed an e-commerce platform that allows freelancers to sell their services efficiently.\n\nThe result is that today the company sees more than 92 million in quarterly revenues which translates to a moderate growth rate. more importantly, it’s a well-established, stabilizing firm overall. Of course, Fiverr benefits from the continued growth in freelance work and the movement away from traditional employment. What’s particularly important to note about the company from a fundamental perspective is that it is rapidly approaching profitability.\n\nThe company did produce a moderate net income of $3.03 million in Q3. Its net loss through the first nine months of 2023 declined from more than $70 million to just above $1 million. As more and more people shun the traditional work environment and Fiverr marches toward increasing profitability, expect its share price to rise.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For those of us wondering if early 2024 was going to carry along the winning spirit of the past two months of calendar 2023… well, at least we got an answer: No. That’s not to say it’s been a disaster, especially coming off such stellar gains at the end of the year. This feels more like cleaning up after the big party. That said, the Dow eked out a gain for the session, +0.27%, but the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 were not quite so lucky: -0.34%, -0.56% and -0.045%, respectively.\r\n\r\nAll major indices are in the red so far in the first trading week of 2024, with the small-cap Russell down nearly -5% in just three days. It would seem a portion of market sentiment currently is to avoid risky stocks, of which the small-caps are considered to be, as a whole. Realistically, pricing in five or six interest cuts for the Fed this year was probably a bit craven to begin with. Curbing expectations here seems like a sound move.\r\n\r\nA big reason for the bifurcation in today’s trading has to do with Apple AAPL, which has now endured its second downgrade in as many days: first Barclay’s takes the iPhone producer to Underweight, and the Piper Sandler goes Neutral from a previous Overweight. Both investment houses slashed share price expectations. With growth rates peaking for the iPhone and other Apple offerings, there is little confidence at this point that Apple Services is going to make up all that slack.\r\n\r\nThe biggest news of the week, however, comes out before the opening bell tomorrow: December non-farm payrolls from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Expectations are for 170-175K new jobs having been filled last month, but with an Unemployment Rate buoying back up to 3.8% (we’ve been between 3.4% and 4% since January of 2022). Hourly Wages are expected to come down a tick to +0.3% growth for the month; +3.9% year over year, also down slightly. The Fed will keep a close eye on this data as it prepares for its next monetary policy meeting in four weeks.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Apple Supplier TDK Bets New Battery Will Change Smartphone Game",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- TDK Corp. is fielding surging inquiries in Asia into a new lineup of smartphone batteries it hopes will become a game-changer in the quest to pack more power into ever-slimmer devices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIslamic State Claims Responsibility for Deadly Iran Blasts Just a Billion Doesn’t Cut It on This Exclusive Florida Island Business Insider Says Ackman’s Wife Plagiarized Doctoral Thesis Tech’s Losing Streak Extends Ahead of Jobs Test: Markets Wrap Confidential Jeffrey Epstein Documents Unsealed by New York Court\n\nThe Apple Inc. supplier is the first to apply to smartphones a technological breakthrough that its rivals have been exploring mainly as a means to stretch mileage for electric vehicles, according to TDK Chief Executive Officer Noboru Saito. In the first half of 2023, the company began shipping small-size lithium-ion batteries using silicon electrodes, manufactured by Hong Kong-based subsidiary Amperex Technology Ltd. (ATL).\n\nTDK, the world’s largest maker of smartphone batteries, is one of several big-name players in a race to enhance energy storage — the industry’s holy grail. Its rivals are taking a different approach for consumer products. Samsung SDI Co. and LG Energy Solution are stacking materials for more compact batteries with higher energy density. Other options run the gamut from graphene-based cells and solid-state batteries to hydrogen fuel cells or sodium-ion batteries.\n\nTo keep its lead in the cutthroat smartphone field, where TDK controls more than a third of the battery market, the company will have to keep chasing knowhow, Saito said.\n\n“We need to assume that other companies will come into this space, and we need to develop the next, followed by the next, technology to differentiate ourselves and keep our lead from shrinking,” the 57-year-old said in an interview. “There’s room for the technology to evolve further.”\n\nTDK now is the sole mass-producer of silicon-carbon batteries for smartphone use. Interest is especially strong from handset makers seeking to gain an edge in a saturated market through ultra-thin devices and different designs, which the high-capacity batteries allow.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne example is Shenzhen-based Honor Device Co.’s latest foldable smartphone, measuring less than 10mm thick, the Magic V2, according to analysts. TDK declined to comment, saying that it does not disclose the names of any of its customers. Honor, whose website said its phone has a silicon-carbon dual battery, vies with Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo Co. and Xiaomi Corp. in China and Asia more broadly. It declined to comment on its suppliers.\n\nTDK says its new battery has 10% more capacity than conventional graphite anode batteries, although industry studies show the technology has the potential to lift capacity by 40% or more. The product should be able to extend battery life in more devices, including mobile game gadgets, wearables and AI-related edge tools, while slimming down their size, Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said.\n\nFor TDK, high-end batteries offer one path to achieve sustainable growth in an item seen as commoditized. The battery segment earns more than half of TDK’s annual revenue, with smartphone makers comprising the bulk of its biggest customers. But growth in smartphone batteries has been flat, TDK has said in recent earnings calls, triggering concerns of slowing growth due to clients’ paper-thin margins.\n\nSaito said he expects the new products to make up a double-digit percentage of the company’s overall smartphone battery sales in terms of volume in the next few years, up from less than 5% now.\n\nTDK acquired ATL, founded by Robin Zeng, in 2005 and expanded its production into the smartphone market, where it won big clients Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. ATL’s nascent EV battery business was spun out in 2011 into Hong Kong-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., with which ATL now has two joint ventures to make rechargeable batteries and battery cells for household energy storage, motorcycles and industrial machines.\n\n“Some may say that our battery sales are headed for a gradual decline, but I disagree. I guarantee that batteries will be a sustainable and big pillar of the group’s portfolio, even over the long term,” Saito said. “As we head into the age of AI where the world gets ever more connected, the demands placed on batteries will only grow, and it’s our mission to meet those needs through new and evolving technology.”\n\n--With assistance from Gao Yuan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy America’s Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs These Are the Five Potential Trouble Spots That Could Knock the Global Economy Off Course Help, I Saw My Boss on a Dating Site AI Hallucinations Are a Boon to Creatives Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was already the least-loved big tech stock on Wall Street. Growing concerns over iPhone sales have now triggered a second downgrade this week, cementing analysts’ cautious approach.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIslamic State Claims Responsibility for Deadly Iran Blasts Just a Billion Doesn’t Cut It on This Exclusive Florida Island Business Insider Says Ackman’s Wife Plagiarized Doctoral Thesis Tech’s Losing Streak Extends Ahead of Jobs Test: Markets Wrap Confidential Jeffrey Epstein Documents Unsealed by New York Court\n\nPiper Sandler & Co.’s Harsh Kumar cut his Apple rating on Thursday, citing a weak macro environment in China that will dampen demand for iPhones.\n\n“We are concerned about handset inventories,” Kumar said in a note, lowering his recommendation for Apple to neutral from overweight after holding a bullish view since March 2020. “Growth rates have peaked for unit sales,” he said.\n\nKumar’s downgrade follows a more bearish move by peers at Barclays Plc, where analysts led by Tim Long cut their rating to underweight on Tuesday.\n\nComing into 2024, Apple was the big tech stock with the least number of bullish recommendations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Piper Sandler’s downgrade now pushes the company’s buy-equivalent ratio down even further — with the percentage of analysts bullish on the company at a three-year low.\n\nApple was the only big tech firm to see revenues contract for the past four quarters. Wall Street is currently anticipating revenue growth of just 3.6% in fiscal 2024 and profit expansion of 7.9%, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe stock, which had rallied nearly 50% last year, has stumbled in the first sessions of 2024. It fell 1.2% on Thursday, its fourth straight negative session. Shares are down 5.5% this year, wiping off $164 billion in market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNearly unanimously bullish on big tech, Wall Street is more cautious when it comes to Apple.

        "title": "Why Wall Street is cooling on Apple stock",
        "content": "The brightest light on Wall Street is dimmer at the start of 2024.\n\nApple (AAPL) the most valuable company on the market, has endured a bruising run in the first days of the new year. The iPhone maker, which commands about 7% of the weight of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index, steering the fate of investor portfolios, drew two stock downgrades this week, pulling shares down more than 5% and raising concerns about weakening iPhone demand.\n\nBarclays struck the first blow. Analysts there cut Apple's rating to underweight and dropped their price target to $160, representing what was a roughly 17% stock price drop for the tech giant from last year.\n\n\"We rate Apple Under Weight as questions persist about the deterioration of iPhone upgrade demand with rising competition in the premium smartphone segment,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe follow up punch landed Thursday, when analysts at Piper Sandler downgraded their rating on Apple's stock to neutral from overweight and sliced their price target by $15 to $205. Apple shares were trading hands at around $182 as of Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"We are concerned about handset inventories entering into 1H24 and also feel that growth rates have peaked for unit sales,\" said lead analyst Harsh Kumar in a note to clients. \"Deteriorating macro environment in China could also weigh on handset business.\"\n\nThe percentage of analysts with a bullish rating on the stock is at a three-year low, according to Bloomberg data. Apple CEO Tim Cook and his leadership team have played up the growth of the company's services segment. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)\n\nApple's iPhone revenue sank about $5 billion in 2023 from the year prior. The flagship iPhone accounts for roughly half the company’s total revenue. Sales of Macs, iPads, and wearables also declined, as rising inflation and interest rates pressured consumers.\n\nBut bullish analysts focus on Apple's growing services businesses, which swelled from $78 billion in 2022 to $85 billion in 2023. In the most recent quarter revenue from services ballooned by almost 20% compared to the same period the year before. Apple's enormous user base and the strength of its services is a crucial component of more optimistic readings on the company's future. Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives pin the value of Apple's services business as high as $1.6 trillion and predict that Cupertino will become the first $4 trillion company by the end of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nSkeptical observers, however, see heightened risks even in Apple's most promising segment. Barclays noted that services might attract more regulatory scrutiny. Investigations into the app store could intensify, especially as other tech giants brace for a wave of significant antitrust rulings this year. How Big Tech figures into the US presidential election and how aggressive the next administration will pursue competition enforcement is another major factor for tech stocks.\n\nApple's lucrative agreement to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser, which is estimated to bring in billions of dollars to its services business, could also be under threat. Closing arguments for the Department of Justice's antitrust case against the search giant are scheduled for the Spring.\n\nApple's dimming prospects among some analysts coincides with a stock performance that lags behind other members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAll the names in the elite, tech-centric group handily beat out the benchmark S&P 500 index. But Apple claimed the lowest position, rising roughly 50% in 2023. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but is notable compared to the staggering gains of Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META), up 239% and 194%, respectively, or even Microsoft's (MSFT) more modest 57% rise. The Nasdaq 100's (^NDX) increase of 54% managed to edge out Apple too.\n\nWhere much of the tech world and even players outside it have scrambled to get in on the AI hype — releasing products, announcing new ventures or simply reciting the words \"AI\" — Apple CEO Tim Cook has taken a more subtle approach. That too may have played a factor in the market's cooling reception.\n\nIn recent earnings calls, Cook has explained that AI is already integrated into the Apple consumer experience. It's just that the company doesn't call out the technologies explicitly, as if it were a marketing gimmick, but relies instead on weaving AI into its products and focusing on the customer benefit. In another rhetorical move that appeared to be gently critical of other tech leaders, Cook said the company tends to unveil new technologies when they are ready for users. And not before.\n\nIf there is a consumer tech company defined by how its products make users feel — for the vibes rather than the intricacies of its software, it's Apple. So not showboating about whats coming in the AI development cycle has its benefits.\n\nBut a more pessimistic interpretation is that as rivals like Microsoft and Meta lean into their large language models, framing generative AI as tech's next great frontier, Apple is getting left behind.

        "title": "Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery",
        "content": "The share price of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has undergone significant volatility, as evidenced by its dramatic fluctuations. In September 2021, the share price stood at $379 per share, but by October 2022, it had plummeted to nearly $92. However, there has been a robust recovery since then, with the price settling around $358 per share at the time of writing. This remarkable turnaround has resulted in year-to-date gains of 180% for Meta. Let's take a closer look to determine whether the stock is attractive to investors at the current price.\n\nEmbracing the Metaverse beyond Facebook\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\n\nMeta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, underwent a significant rebranding in October 2021. The company's original core application, Facebook, was a primary driver of user engagement, revenue and profitability. The rebranding to Meta, which hints at the concept of the \"Metaverse,\" reflects the company's future direction. With a mission \"to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together,\" the social meadia giant aims to make the metaverse a reality through its diverse product offerings. The company operates through two main business segments: the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).\n\nIn 2022, the FoA segment, which includes popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, was a major revenue generator. It brought in nearly $114.5 billion, accounting for 98.2% of Meta's total revenue. This segment primarily earns through selling advertising placements to marketers. On the other hand, the RL segment, focused on virtual and augmented reality technologies, contributed significantly less, with revenue of only $2.16 billion, less than 2% of the total sales. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nThe FoA segment is highly profitable, generating $42.66 billion in operating income with an impressive operating margin of 37%. In contrast, the RL segment recorded $13.7 billion in losses. Meta has been leveraging the profitability of the FoA segment to support and develop the RL segment, aligning with its broader vision for the metaverse.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh growth, recent challenges and strategic revival\n\nOver the past decade, Meta has demonstrated consistently high revenue growth. In 2012, its revenue stood at $5 billion, soaring to nearly $118 billion by 2021, before slightly declining to $116.6 billion in 2022. The annual growth rate between 2012 and 2021 varied from 21.6% to 58.4%. However, in 2022, there was a 1.1% decrease in sales, partly attributed to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Nonetheless, on a constant currency basis, sales growth was 4% in 2022. This slowdown in sales growth mainly resulted from a global reduction in advertising spending, influenced by a sluggish global economy and rising interest rates. Additionally, challenges arose from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"app tracking transparency\" feature, which allows users to prevent apps from tracking their activities across devices.\n\nIn 2022, Meta's operating income plummeted by 38% to nearly $29 billion. This significant drop was not only due to sluggish sales growth, but also an increase in payroll and expenses related to a 20% increase in employee headcount. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nSince late 2022 and into early 2023, Meta initiated restructuring efforts to enhance its operating performance. This involved three rounds of restructuring and layoffs, particularly in recruiting and technical departments, resulting in over 20,000 job cuts. By the second quarter of 2023, Meta's workforce had been reduced to approximately 66,100 employees, a 7% decrease from the previous quarter. The 2022 restructuring led to a leaner organization and improved operating margins. Meta also leveraged artificial intelligence to boost product and business performance. AI-driven feed recommendations significantly increased user engagement, leading to a 7% rise in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram. Furthermore, Meta's Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns achieved a $10 billion run rate, with over 50% of advertisers utilizing the Advantage+Creative tool for ad optimization.\n\nAs a result of these restructuring efforts and initiatives, Meta's financial performance in the first three quarters of 2023 improved significantly. Revenue grew by 23% to $34.15 billion and operating profit surged by 145% to $13.75 billion. Consequently, the operating margin expanded remarkably from nearly 19.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 40.36% in the third quarter of 2023. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nSolid balance sheet and prudent debt management\n\nMeta possesses a robust balance sheet, characterized by effective leverage management. As of September, the company held approximately $36.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, along with $24.2 billion in marketable securities, including U.S. government and corporate debt instruments. Its long-term debt was relatively modest at $18.4 billion. This debt comprises fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, issued in August 2022 and May 2023, at favorable interest rates. The interest rates on these notesvaried from 3.50% to 5.75%. Furthermore, the maturity dates of these debts are spread out, ranging from 2027 to as far out as 2063. The principal payments for these debts are staggered, each ranging from $1 billion to a maximum of $3 billion. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nPotential upside\n\nOver the last 10 years, Meta has consistently increased its earnings per share, starting from a mere 1 cents in 2012, escalating to a peak of $13.77 in 2021 and then settling at $8.59 in 2022. Following its recent restructuring and the implementation of AI-driven initiatives, which have significantly improved its operating margin, the company is projected to achieve increased revenue and earnings per share in 2024. For 2024, it is estimated that Meta will generate approximately $150.7 billion in revenue and earnings of $17.39 per share. Over the last five years, Meta's price-earnings ratio has fluctuated between 8.65 and 37.90. Using the five-year average price-earnings ratio of 25.50, the estimated value of Meta's shares is around $443, which is nearly 24% higher than its current trading price. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta Platforms' financial journey is a testament to resilience and strategic foresight in a volatile market. Despite the challenges posed by global economic shifts and technological disruptions, the company's effective restructuring, particularly in 2023, and its commitment to innovation have catalyzed a significant turnaround. The company has a strong balance sheet, a focused approach to debt management and promising projections for revenue and earnings growth. The current market valuation of Meta's stock, while robust, suggests it is undervalued.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "US regulator denies Apple, Disney bids to skip votes on AI",
        "content": "By Ross Kerber\n\nJan 4 (Reuters) - Apple and Disney cannot avoid shareholder votes about their use of artificial intelligence put forward by a labor group, the top U.S. securities regulator has ruled.\n\nIn notices dated Jan. 3, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected requests by the iPhone maker and by the entertainment giant to exclude from their upcoming annual meetings calls for reports on their use of AI.\n\nCorporations have embraced the new technology for its promised efficiencies. But the trend has prompted fears it would replace many creative and professional workers or unfairly draw on their work, issues in recent Hollywood labor disputes and a recent New York Times lawsuit.\n\nThe similar shareholder proposals were filed by a pension trust of the AFL-CIO, the largest American labor union federation, which also has AI measures pending at four other technology companies.\n\nAt Apple, the group asked for a report on the company's use of AI \"in its business operations and disclose any ethical guidelines that the company has adopted regarding the company’s use of AI technology.\" In a similar request, it also asked Disney to report on its board's role overseeing AI usage.\n\nIn its supporting statement at Apple the AFL-CIO wrote that \"AI systems should not be trained on copyrighted works, or the voices, likenesses and performances of professional performers, without transparency, consent and compensation to creators and rights holders.\"\n\nBrandon Rees, deputy director of the AFL-CIO's office of investment, said the SEC's decisions could pave the way for agreements with Apple and Disney that would only bring them into line with the AI disclosures of other companies like Microsoft .\n\nApple and Disney, in contrast, \"haven't even begun to grapple with these ethical issues\" around AI, Rees said.\n\nApple and Disney did not immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nBoth companies had argued the proposals could be left off their ballots because they related to \"ordinary business operations,\" such as the company's choice of technologies.\n\nThe SEC disagreed. \"In our view, the Proposal transcends ordinary business matters and does not seek to micromanage the Company,\" the agency wrote in separate letters.

        "title": "Is Apple (AAPL) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.73 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.7% and 10.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AAPL Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AAPL\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Apple, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in AAPL?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.56.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was already the least-loved big tech stock on Wall Street. Growing concerns over iPhone sales have now triggered a second downgrade this week, cementing analysts’ cautious approach.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nConfidential Jeffrey Epstein Documents Unsealed by New York Court Fed Sees Rates Staying High for Some Time With Cuts Eyed in 2024 Saving the Panama Canal Will Take Years and Cost Billions, If It’s Even Possible Tech Stocks Log Four-Day Losing Streak, Bonds Rise: Markets Wrap Iran Blasts That Killed Nearly 100 Add to Mideast Tensions\n\nPiper Sandler & Co.’s Harsh Kumar cut his Apple rating on Thursday, citing a weak macro environment in China that will dampen demand for iPhones.\n\n“We are concerned about handset inventories,” Kumar said in a note, lowering his recommendation for Apple to neutral from overweight after holding a bullish view since March 2020. “Growth rates have peaked for unit sales,” he said.\n\nKumar’s downgrade follows a more bearish move by peers at Barclays Plc, where analysts led by Tim Long cut their rating to underweight on Tuesday.\n\nComing into 2024, Apple was already the big tech stock with the least number of bullish recommendations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Piper Sandler’s downgrade now pushes the company’s buy-equivalent ratio down even further — with the percentage of analysts bullish on the company at a three-year low.\n\nApple was the only big tech firm to see revenues contract for the past four quarters. Wall Street is currently anticipating revenue growth of just 3.6% in fiscal 2024 and profit expansion of 7.9%, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe stock, which had rallied nearly 50% last year, has stumbled in the first sessions of 2024. It has slid 4.3% this year, wiping off nearly $130 billion in market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares are now on the brink of breaching into the oversold territory as they’re set to extend losses for a fourth consecutive session.\n\nStory continues\n\nNearly unanimously bullish on big tech, Wall Street is more cautious when it comes to Apple. The stock has attracted only 33 buy-equivalent recommendations. That pales in comparison to Amazon.com Inc.’s 68, Meta Platforms Inc.’s 66 and the 59 bullish ratings for Nvidia Corp.\n\n--With assistance from Matt Turner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHelp, I Saw My Boss on a Dating Site These Are the Five Potential Trouble Spots That Could Knock the Global Economy Off Course Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?

        "title": "Huawei’s homegrown operating system, launched after the company was put on a U.S. blacklist, may soon overtake Apple’s iOS in China",
        "content": "Just a few years ago, Huawei was so pressured by U.S. trade blacklists that it offloaded its budget smartphone division. But the Chinese electronics giant is having a comeback with a buzzy return to the high-end phone market that's pulling consumer attention away from Apple's iPhone.\n\nNow, Huawei may soon be on the verge of surpassing Apple in one metric, as its homegrown HarmonyOS operating system is poised to overtake Apple's iOS in China this year, according to the South China Morning Postciting a report from tech research firm TechInsights. iOS and Android, the open-source OS primarily developed by Google, will continue to dominate the global market.\n\nHuawei's decision to develop its own operating system took on greater importance following U.S. sanctions on the company. The Chinese company originally used the Android operating system in its smartphones, yet announced HarmonyOS in August 2019, just a few months after the Trump administration added Huawei to the Entity List, which forced the company to get Washington's approval for any purchases of U.S. technology. Huawei executives had previously described the development of its own operating system as a \"Plan B,\" as the company faced the prospect of being barred from using key hardware or software with U.S. origins.\n\nHuawei's initial success in getting HarmonyOS off the ground could be an indicator that the Chinese firm is maintaining its technical expertise in spite of U.S. sanctions. Huawei is now gearing up for another major transition by preparing to abandon Android entirely. Previous versions of HarmonyOS supported apps developed for Android, yet Huawei's next update will end this compatibility, creating what the company calls a \"pure\" operating system.\n\nChinese tech companies are scrambling to develop HarmonyOS-compatible versions of their apps. Chinese firms are reportedly ramping up efforts to hire developers for HarmonyOS, including companies like Alipay owner Ant Group and McDonald's China.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn August, Huawei said at its annual developer conference that more than 700 million devices currently run on HarmonyOS with more than 2.2 million third-party developers creating apps for the platform.\n\nHuawei's comeback\n\nThe rise of HarmonyOS is also coming as Huawei successfully returns to the 5G smartphone market, symbolized by its surprise release of the Mate 60 Pro in August last year. The phone features an advanced locally developed seven-nanometer chip, despite U.S. sanctions on both Huawei and China's broader chip industry.\n\nHuawei's Mate 60 Pro smartphone was an immediate success, with state media outlets and commentators proclaiming the phone a national achievement. The company sold 1.6 million Mate 60 handsets in its first six weeks of sales, according to market research firm Counterpoint Research.\n\n“The clear standout in October has been Huawei with its turnaround on the back of its Mate 60 series devices. Growth has been stellar with its new launch marketing and strong media coverage around its ‘Made in China’ chipset,” said Archie Zeng, a China analyst for Counterpoint Research in a report on the Chinese smartphone market released in November.\n\nHuawei captured about 13% of China's smartphone market in 2023, up from 7.6% in 2022, estimates Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.\n\nThe company predicts that it generated almost $100 billion in sales in 2023, up from a recent low of $89.6 billion in 2021. \"After years of hard work, we’ve managed to weather the storm,\" Huawei rotating chairman Ken Hu said to employees in late December. Still, the company has yet to surpass the $137 billion in revenue reported in 2020.\n\nHuawei's return could be bad news for Apple, which counts China as one of its most important overseas markets. Sales of Apple's iPhone 15, which the company released a few weeks after Huawei's Mate 60 Pro, underperformed in its first 17 days on sale, compared to Apple's previous models.\n\nApple is also contending with new regulations from Beijing. Chinese officials will soon require all programs sold on Chinese app stores, including Apple's, to have a license from the government. Apple may be forced to remove thousands of apps from its Chinese store once the grace period ends in March.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) needs little introduction.\n\nThe iPhone maker has built an unrivaled consumer tech ecosystem, selling high-priced devices and related high-margin services like the App Store and Apple Pay. Its business model and reputation for quality products have allowed Apple to generate enormous profits and made it the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap today of about $2.9 trillion. With modest growth, the company could be worth $5 trillion by 2030.\n\nHowever, just because Apple is the most valuable company in the world today doesn't mean it will always be. Just ask ExxonMobil, General Electric, and IBM, all of which have fallen sharply from their earlier positions as the most valuable companies in the country.\n\nWhile Apple still appears to be in great shape, a number of companies have the potential to move past it by 2030. Let's take a look at three of them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nOf all the companies that could top Apple in market cap by 2030, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has the best chance of doing so. In fact, it's already knocking on the door with a market cap of $2.76 trillion, just 5% smaller than Apple.\n\nBut that's not the only reason why Microsoft could reclaim the title of the world's most valuable company. It is on the cutting edge of the artificial intelligence (AI) business thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, and it's in the process of incorporating generative AI technologies across its portfolio of products, including its Azure cloud infrastructure business, Office software suite, and Bing search engine.\n\nMicrosoft Azure is also growing faster than rivals like Amazon Web Services, and the company has a history of making smart acquisitions under CEO Satya Nadella, including Linkedin, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard.\n\nFinally, Microsoft is more diversified than Apple and its fellow tech giants, making it more resistant to recessions and better able to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the breakout star of 2023. The company's AI chips have been in high demand as cloud infrastructure companies, start-ups, and other tech companies look to build out their capacity to run complex generative AI models.\n\nNvidia's revenue tripled year over year in the third quarter, and it has built out a commanding lead in artificial intelligence (AI) chips and components. In fact, there's a shortage of the kind of graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators that Nvidia produces.\n\nDemand for generative AI components and infrastructure seems set to explode as many tech CEOs expect generative AI to be revolutionary, and that could fuel Nvidia's growth over the coming years.\n\nCurrently, the company enjoys a large competitive advantage in AI chips with a profit margin above 50%, which could enable the company to grow from $1 trillion to $5 trillion by 2030, potentially topping Apple by then.\n\n3. Tesla\n\nFinally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has a chance to exceed Apple's market cap in the next six years.\n\nIt has already disrupted the auto sector once by proving that electric vehicles (EVs) can be a profitable business, and it essentially took the concept mainstream. Now, it has a chance of disrupting the sector again with autonomous vehicle technology and robotaxis. Tesla bulls like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood expect the company to deploy a fleet of robotaxis in the coming years, and predict that autonomous vehicles will eventually produce the majority of its revenue.\n\nThat could still be several years away, but Tesla's track record and its commitment to innovation in areas like its autonomous robot, Optimus, give the stock significant upside potential. For Tesla to reach $5 trillion in market cap, it would have to grow roughly six times larger, but that's as much as investors such as Wood expect it to appreciate.\n\nIf Tesla can pull off the pivot to autonomous vehicles, its stock could skyrocket from here. While that may seem impossible, Tesla has shown its ability to overcome long odds in the past, and it could do it again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "U.S. and European equity markets have kicked off the new year on the backfoot, with both pulling back slightly on the second trading day of 2024 from 2023 record high closes.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down 60 points to 4,714 from its 2023 close at 1130 hrs ET on Wednesday while the Stoxx Europe 600 was also down marginally. Yields on 10-year US bonds and German bunds have also started creeping up, with the U.S. rate quoted at 3.956% as money markets wagered on the Federal Reserve cutting rates by fewer than 150 basis points in 2024.\n\nThankfully, the U.S. energy sector has started the year on a more positive note, with the sector’s benchmark Energy Select Sector Fund (XLE) up 2.1% in the first two trading days and Brent and WTI gaining over 3% on Wednesday.\n\nGrowing tensions in the  Middle East have worsened fears of oil supply disruptions after an Iranian warship entered the Red Sea and raised the specter of the conflict spilling over into the region.\n\nThe markets remain a bit edgy because of the uncertainty surrounding precisely when the Federal will start cutting rates, and also because the Fed has cautioned about the lingering possibility of a mild recession.\n\nMarket action suggests there’s an outside chance of a 25-basis-point cut at just 12.9% in January, but a much bigger 87.1% chance that the central bank will leave rates unchanged when it releases its December meeting minutes on Wednesday at 1400 hrs ET. Fed officials held the policy interest rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range at their meeting in mid-December, but signaled they would cut rates by at least 75 basis points in the current year as inflation steadily declines to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nRelated: Oil Gains Over 3% On Libya, OPEC and Middle East Escalation\n\nThat said, equity markets remain largely bullish with Principal Financial Group predicting that 2024 is setting up to be the \"year of the pivot.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n“Markets surprised to the upside in 2023, despite a host of challenges, and fought off a widely expected recession to finish the year near record highs. Looking ahead to 2024, the market rebound, combined with the Federal Reserve’s rate pause, has set the stage for a long-anticipated pivot toward rate cuts,” Principal said in an investor note.\n\nIn other words, investors are looking forward to further gains in the stock markets in 2024. The U.S. market returned just under 25% while its European peer gained 13% in 2023 amid optimism that central banks will return to a rate cut regime. Supporting the optimistic market viewpoint is the fact that headline inflation decelerated to 3.1% in November, unemployment has declined to 3.7%  while 2023 GDP growth could potentially clock in at 2.6% based on the Federal Reserve’s latest projections.\n\nSource: J.P. Morgan\n\nBut it’s not just Wall Street that’s feeling upbeat about the new year. The American Association of Individual Investors has reported an underlying shift towards a bullish position with many bearish investor viewpoints now in the rearview mirror.\n\nAccording to a year-end sentiment survey put together by the organization, 46.3% of investors are bullish on the broader market; 25.1% hold a bearish stance while 28.6% remain neutral. While the majority of investors are still either bearish or neutral, it’s important to note that the sentiment has shifted dramatically over the past two months considering that only 24.3% of individuals were bullish while 50.3% looked at the market from a bearish lens when the survey was carried out on Nov. 1.\n\nHistorical precedent also seems to favor the bulls.\n\nOn Monday, Ned Davis Research noted that the S&P 500 sat less than 1% from its all-time trading high of 4,818 that it hit on Jan. 3, 2022. The analysts have noted that the gap between those two peaks is the sixth longest between record highs, and such lengthy gaps tend to be followed by a period of outperformance.\n\n“There have been 14 cases of the S&P 500 going at least one year without an all-time high. After the record has been eclipsed, the S&P 500 has outperformed its long-term average one-, three-, six-, and 12-months later. One-month returns are not quite as strong (up 71% of the time by a median of 1.8%), suggesting a short-term overbought condition. One year later, the index has risen 13 out of 14 times by a median of 13.4%. A new high after a long stretch often marks a new stage of the bull market rather than its conclusion,’’ the analysts have noted.\n\nJanuary Selloff For Megacap Tech Stocks\n\nBut not all corners of the market are expected to remain hale and hearty; at least not in the early innings of the year. Bank of America has warned about a January \"rout\" in megacap tech stocks, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp.(NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in danger of underperforming.\n\n\"Crowding risk in the leaders of 2023 has been cited by many (including ourselves) as a key risk in 2024. In particular, year-end 'window dressing' may have pushed active funds into big Tech leaders, but these stocks could be used as a source of funds if a hard landing is avoided and leadership broadens beyond secular growth stocks,\" BofA equity strategist Savita Subramanian has said in a note.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nArgentina’s New President Is Looking To Shake Up Its Oil Industry The 11 States Leading America’s Oil Production Boom What Will Influence Oil Prices in 2024?\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) closed at $184.25 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.75% move from the prior day. This move was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.8%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.76%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.18%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 4.02% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.11% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.4% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.08, reflecting a 10.64% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $117.31 billion, reflecting a 0.13% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.56 per share and a revenue of $393.42 billion, signifying shifts of +7.01% and +2.65%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Apple is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.29. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 20.82.\n\nInvestors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.56 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.56 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 189, positioning it in the bottom 25% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "From AI to flying cars, here’s what to expect at CES 2024",
        "content": "It’s January, and that means the entire tech world, with the notable exception of Apple (AAPL), will soon descend upon Las Vegas for CES 2024. The annual consumer electronics trade show, which runs from Jan. 9 through Jan. 12, serves as a showcase for the biggest technology trends that will likely make their way into our lives.\n\nOver the years that’s included everything from high-end vehicle infotainment systems and 4K, OLED TVs to electric scooters and new computer chips. Of course, there’s also the collection of oddities that flood the show’s various booths and displays. Think talking toilets and forks that tell you if you’re eating too fast.\n\nAnd CES 2024 looks set to pack even more of the equal parts impressive and downright confounding products that will end up in our living rooms and driveways in the months and years to come. Naturally, Yahoo Finance will be live on the ground in Sin City, weaving through the thousands of attendees to bring you all of the latest news from the big show.\n\nSo, what can you expect out of CES 2024? Funny you should ask…\n\nAI will be the talk of the show\n\nThe AI revolution that dominated headlines in 2023 will continue to roll on in 2024.You can expect everyone from chip makers and automotive companies to TV manufacturers and more to talk up the benefits of AI during the big show.\n\nOne of the biggest themes is likely to be based around the AI PC. AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each debuted their own AI PC chips in recent months, with Intel showing off its Core Ultra AI PC processors in December.\n\nThe idea behind AI PCs is to add AI processing capabilities to laptop and desktop chips so that users can run AI applications on their own computers rather than in the cloud. The thinking is that if you need to run sensitive data like personal information or corporate files through an AI program, doing so on your computer is safer than sending them up to the cloud. Signs display the name of an Intel event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. Intel is introducing new products that are designed to be used with AI powered computers and applications. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut beyond that, companies are still trying to figure out how AI PCs will benefit most people. During Intel’s December AI Everywhere event, company representatives said that it’ll be up to developers to come up with new apps and programs that take advantage of new AI PC features.\n\nStory continues\n\nChip makers won’t be the only companies focusing on AI. Automakers, retailers, and home appliance manufacturers will undoubtedly explain how they’re using AI to power their latest and greatest products.\n\nAI will likely be so ubiquitous at CES 2024 that it’ll be strange if a company doesn’t mention the technology. Heck, Samsung says that it’s bringing AI to its kitchen appliances, including its refrigerators.\n\nMore cars than a dealership\n\nIt’s cliche to say that CES is as much a car show as it is a technology event. Automakers from across the world pack the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center with their hottest cars, trucks, SUVs, and, occasionally, flying cars, filling the air with the smell of fresh rubber and the promise of a future where you can watch TV while your vehicle chauffeurs you around town.\n\nIn past years companies ranging from Ford (F) and BMW to Hyundai (HYMTF) and Chevy (GM) have debuted new in-car technologies designed to improve the driving experience. Last year BMW revealed a concept for a customizable kind of paint job that you can adjust at any time. That same year, Sony (SONY) and Honda (HMC) unveiled their concept car AFEELA. This year Sony Honda Mobility will be back with a prototype of the AFEELA. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAs for the flying cars, Uber (UBER) and Hyundai teamed up to announce their flying taxi at CES 2020. This year Hyundai Motor Group’s Advanced Air Mobility company, Supernal, will take the wraps off of its electric vertical takeoff and landing [eVTOL] vehicle complete with a vertiport exhibit that will showcase how passengers will ride in the flying concept.\n\nTVs get smarter and brighter\n\nTVs are a mainstay of CES. They’re also my favorite part of the show. Where else can you see every next-generation television you’ll beg your spouse to get in one place?\n\nThe biggest trend in TVs is microLED technology, which promises the color of OLED sets with the brightness of LED systems. So far, however, those TVs have been incredibly expensive, with prices in the tens of thousands of dollars. But that’s expected to come down over time, and could eventually become relatively affordable for the average consumer.

(Photo by David Becker/Getty Images) (David Becker via Getty Images)\n\nTVs are also getting more AI capabilities, as well. LG announced on Jan. 3 that its latest OLED TVs will feature updated AI processors that improve image and sound quality. The company also said that its wireless television, which it debuted at CES 2023, will now be available with a smaller 65-inch screen. There’s also a larger 97-inch model that, well, just won’t fit in my Queens apartment.\n\nLots of weird and wild products\n\nOne of the best parts of CES is seeing so many wild, attention-grabbing products in one place. Some of them are practical, like leak detectors for under your kitchen sink and Wi-Fi-enabled meat thermometers that send you an alert on your phone when your steak is ready. Some aren’t so practical; I’m looking at you electric roller skates.\n\nI’ve seen more weird gadgets and gizmos over the years than I can count, and CES 2024 will be no different. And I’ll be bringing you all of that and more when the big show kicks off. Stay tuned.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "title": "Apple’s tough start to 2024: Brief hangover or sign of decline?",
        "content": "Hello, tech editor Alexei Oreskovic here. The year 2024 is off to a tough start for Apple. In the day-and-a-half that the stock market has been open this year, the iPhone maker's stock has fallen by nearly 5%.\n\nIf the decline holds by the time the market closes Wednesday, that will represent a loss of more than $120 billion in market value in just two days. Two very expensive days.\n\nThe immediate cause of the drubbing was a downgrade by Barclays on Tuesday, hitting Apple's stock with an \"underweight\" rating (analyst-speak for \"sell\"). The downgrade was a manifestation of deeper investor unease with the company's prospects.\n\nApple's overall revenue has declined for four consecutive quarters, and the company has hinted at modest expectations for holiday sales. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple's revenue, is facing stiffer competition in China, and the Apple Watch is locked in a patent fight that forced Apple to halt sales of certain models in the U.S. for a few days last year.\n\nIf things look bleak for the Cupertino, Calif., company, there are a few bright spots on the horizon:\n\nApple's services business continues to be an underappreciated giant. According to Apple bull Dan Ives's \"sum of the parts\" analysis, the services business is worth $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion on a standalone basis.\n\nThe VisionPro, Apple's $3,500 mixed reality headset, is due to go on sale this year. The company is treading cautiously with a very limited rollout of the new device—so sales of the VisionPro this year will not move the needle for Apple. But if consumers cotton to the device, it could provide a much-needed jolt of excitement to Apple's image that translates into broader sales.\n\nFinally, Apple has yet to show its cards in the high-stakes game of generative AI. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has developed its own large language model and has been internally testing an \"Apple GPT\" chatbot based on it for months.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf there's any doubt about how gaga Wall Street is for AI right now, just look at Microsoft's fortunes last year as it hooked up with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI: Microsoft's stock finished 2023 up 50%.\n\nWith that, here are more of today's top tech stories.\n\nAlexei Oreskovic\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is making advancements to add features to its original Pixel Watch.\r\n\r\nA month ago, it was announced that this particular smartwatch would be upgraded with some of the features of the Pixel Watch 2. It has now started featuring DND and Bedtime Mode sync.\r\n\r\nUsers can avail of these features by opening the Pixel Watch companion app.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s solid efforts to strengthen its Pixel Watch series are expected to continue helping it bolster its presence in the booming smartwatch market.\r\n\r\nPer a Fortune Business Insights report, the global smartwatch market is anticipated to reach $77.22 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 14.8% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing prospects in this promising market are expected to aid it in gaining investors’ optimism in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nGrowth promises associated with Pixel Watches are expected to contribute well to the performance of Google Services segment which has been the key growth driver of the company.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s shares have gained 56.2% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 53.1%.\r\n\r\nGrowing Google Services segment is expected to continue driving its overall performance.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues is pegged at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.3%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pinned at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.7% in the past 30 days.\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nAlthough Alphabet is a late entrant in this market, its growing smartwatch efforts are likely to intensify competition for other incumbents that are leaving no stone unturned to expand footprint in the smartwatch market, like Apple AAPL and Garmin GRMN.\r\n\r\nApple, currently dominating the smartwatch market on the back of its expanding Watch family, is constantly making efforts to sustain its supremacy. The strong adoption of the Apple Watch on the back of useful and advanced features like Cycle Tracking, the Noise app and Activity Trends remains a major positive.\r\n\r\nThe company recently announced the availability of watchOS 10 to further strengthen the Apple Watch series.\r\n\r\nMore than two-thirds of the customers who purchased the Apple Watch during fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 were first-time customers.\r\n\r\nGarmin’s expanding product portfolio for the Fitness and Outdoor business, which has been built with both internal development efforts and acquisitions, makes the company a potential player in the wearable space.\r\n\r\nThe launch of its new health and fitness smartwatch called vivoactive 5 and GPS smartwatches, namely the Venu 3 and Venu 3S, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThese devices are comprised of robust healthcare features like sleep coach, which offers a sleep score and personalized coaching that keeps track of different sleep stages, naps, Pulse Ox1 and heart rate variability (“HRV”) status; morning report, which provides an overview of sleep, recovery and HRV status; nap detection, which tracks or logs naps automatically and Body Battery enhancements, which monitor energy levels throughout the day.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Another Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nAnother top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Camtek CAMT, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nCamtek shares have returned 220.4% over the past year.

        "title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Downgrade Creates Buying Opportunity",
        "content": "Yesterday was not quite the way Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stockholders wanted to kick off the new year, with shares suffering one of the worst single-day plunges in months. Apple stock got battered, falling 3.6% on the first trading day of 2024 due to the notable downgrade from Barclays (NYSE:BCS) to Sell from Hold.\n\nUndoubtedly, Sell ratings are few and far between on Wall Street these days. So, the downgrade was enough to send shivers down the spines of investors of the iPhone maker and Magnificent Seven holding, whose magnificence is sure to be tested (and perhaps questioned) throughout the year.\n\nIndeed, Apple isn’t a $3 trillion company anymore after more than $100 billion in market cap was wiped out in a day.\n\nThough five-star-rated Barclays analyst Tim Long had his fair share of reasons for the downgrade (“lackluster” iPhone 15 sales in China, for one) and a price target of $160.00 — which entails more than 13% in downside from here — I think investors should view any such dip to such levels as more of a buying opportunity than a sign that it’s curtains for the Cupertino-based tech titan.\n\nThe iPhone 15 Underwhelms. The iPhone 16 May Not Be Much Better, Says Barclays\n\nBesides weak iPhone 15 sales expectations, Long doesn’t see the next iPhone as a catalyst that could help Apple make up for lost time.\n\n“We see no features of upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,” Long said.\n\nThat downbeat note on the next iPhone is incredibly discouraging for investors. However, it’s quite a stretch to shoot down the next iPhone when we don’t know what the next device could feature.\n\nIndeed, it seems like Apple stock seems to be heavily impacted by bearish notes than bullish ones. In a way, it’s the most unloved of the Magnificent Seven. For example, recently, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives touted Apple as a “golden opportunity” with a $4 trillion market cap in sight. Still, the stock didn’t surge 4% on that news. So, why the overweighting on the negatives? I guess it’s easier to be bearish on Apple stock than peers, who seem more than willing to serve investors what they want: AI announcements.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll considered, I believe the negativity surrounding Apple is overdone, and I am staying bullish, just like Mr. Ives, a bull whose call is being drowned out by excess negativity and a more recent Barclays downgrade.\n\nWhy It Could Be a Mistake to Discount the iPhone 16’s Potential\n\nFor now, iPhone 16 features are surrounding items rotating in the rumor mill. As such, I don’t think it’s justified to dismiss the next iPhone as uncompelling. The iPhone 16 may not feature a game-changing design. That said, I do believe that hardware innovations could make the next iteration of the iPhone a pretty substantial upgrade, perhaps the largest upgrade in a few cycles.\n\nThe iPhone 16 is rumored to have the A18 chip, which could feature even more impressive graphical capabilities. Indeed, the current A17 Pro chip featured in iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models can already run some impressive triple-A game titles. Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 Remake and Resident Evil Village are ambitious titles that show the graphical firepower of Apple’s latest chip. Undoubtedly, the latest iPhone shows potential in the handheld gaming device market.\n\nThere’s one big problem, however. There simply aren’t enough triple-A titles for gamers to view the latest iPhone as a suitable alternative to the many PC-based handheld devices out there that can run a slew of titles. This could change once Apple is ready to pull the curtain on its latest iPhone 16 later this year.\n\nApple Entering a “New Era of Gaming,” Says Video Game Industry Visionary\n\nFor the iPhone 15 reveal, there was quite an emphasis on gaming. However, I believe that’s just an appetizer ahead of a main course. This year will see the launch of Apple Vision Pro, a device that could be propelled to the forefront by gaming announcements. Indeed, gaming continues to be a main attraction to the medium of spatial computing and the Metaverse.\n\nIf Apple can acquire a major gaming studio (something I suggested in a prior piece) or pick up the pace of its gaming-related partnerships like the ones it made with Capcom and legendary game creator Hideo Kojima, I do not doubt that Apple could tap video games as a means to jolt Vision Pro, iPhone, and even Services sales growth.\n\nLast year, Hideo Kojima made a bold statement, saying that Apple is entering a “new era of gaming.” As one of the brightest and most innovative minds in gaming, investors and gamers should not take such a statement lightly.\n\nIs Apple Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 31 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target is $203.04, implying upside potential of 10.1%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nIt’s all too easy to be bearish on Apple stock right now and believe Barclays’ Tim Long over the likes of Wedbush’s Daniel Ives.\n\nAfter Apple’s awful start to 2024, I believe the odds favor the bulls over the bears. Apple’s iPhone 15 may be running out of steam, but there are a lot of new devices (and perhaps some services) coming in 2024. I wouldn’t overlook them.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The largest technology stocks that lifted the broader market last year are having a less-rosy start to 2024.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHarvard’s President Quits After Plagiarism, Antisemitism Furor Bonds Edge Higher as Traders Shake Off Fed Minutes: Markets Wrap Saving the Panama Canal Will Take Years and Cost Billions, If It’s Even Possible Iran Sends Warship to Red Sea After US Sinks Houthi Boats Iran Blasts That Killed More Than 100 Stoke Mideast Tensions\n\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven, which includes Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp., have slipped for last four consecutive trading days, the longest losing streak in a month, according to the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index. Shares of Apple, down nearly 5% in the time period, lead the slump that’s erased roughly $370 billion in market value. The Nasdaq 100 Index has also fallen in the last four trading days.\n\n“We don’t know if last year’s rally has fully ended, but it is completely normal to expect markets will pull back after a rally like we saw,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers Group. “Without the year-end factors that turbocharged the rally, I think we’re seeing the party winding down.”\n\nIt’s a signal that investor doubts over the sticking power of the 2023 rally were well-placed. Though the group surged more than 100% last year, driven by a frenzy in artificial intelligence, gains cooled in the second half of 2023 as investors mulled the Federal Reserve’s ability to execute a soft landing for the US economy, which would likely mean fewer interest rate cuts than expected.\n\n“You’re not going to get high-single-digit or double-digit earnings growth if we get something worse than a soft landing,” Sosnick said. “But we’re not going to get six cuts with a soft landing.”\n\nA few members of the group have also seen specific stock pressure early this year. Apple shares have been weighed down after gaining a new bear; Barclays Plc analysts early this week downgraded shares of the tech giant to underweight, saying they expect soft demand for iPhones going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla has shed more than 8% in the last four days, its longest streak of losses since November. Though Tesla reported Tuesday that it delivered more electric vehicles in the fourth quarter than analysts expected, the company lost its place as the top seller of electric cars to China’s BYD Co.\n\nTo be sure, it is likely too early to say the tech-focused rally is over. Most of 2023’s gains recouped losses from a year earlier, and some of the group - Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla - are still below their all-time highs, signaling they could have room to run.\n\nBut, the largest tech names also have their work cut out for them in 2024. The companies need to continue to deliver not only solid technology, but profitable technology going forward, according to Sosnick.\n\n“In December everyone bought the sizzle,” he said. “Now we have to see if the steak is any good.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHelp, I Saw My Boss on a Dating Site Tesla Is Losing Out to a Chinese EV Maker Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?

        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares settled lower on Tuesday, Jan. 2, after Barclays downgraded its rating on the stock.\n\nBarclays analyst Tim Long downgraded the stock from Equal-Weight to Underweight and lowered the price target from $161 to $160.\n\nThe analyst slightly lowered his AAPL estimates following another round of checks. He still picks up weakness in iPhone volumes and mix and a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads, and wearables.\n\nApple is now reportedly expected to launch its futuristic $3,500 Vision Pro headset in the last week of January, accelerating the launch timeline from February.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends too. As of now, the Cupertino, California-based company offers an annual dividend yield of 0.52%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,160,250 or around 6,250 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $232,050 or around 1,250 shares.\n\nRead This: $1M Bet On This Healthcare Stock? Check Out These 3 Penny Stocks Insiders Are Aggressively Buying\n\nTo Calculate:  Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.68 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares ($100 per month).\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works:  The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 3.6% to close at $185.64 on Tuesday.\n\nRead More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

Two of the three major stock indexes ended in the red, while one ended in the green.\n\nHow Did the Benchmarks Perform?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 25.5 points, or 0.1%, to close at 37,715.54. Eighteen components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 12 ended in positive.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 245.41 points, or 1.6%, to close at 14,765.94.\n\nThe S&P 500 slid 27 points, or 0.6%, to close at 4,742.83. Five of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) declined 2.6%, 1% and 0.9%, respectively, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) advanced 1.8%.\n\nThe fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 6% to 13.20. A total of 11.9 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.4 billion.\n\nApple (AAPL) Weighs Down on the Tech Sector\n\nShares of Apple Inc. AAPL declined 3.6% after Barclays downgraded the tech behemoth’s rating to “underweight”. The analysts cited weakening demand for the company’s flagship mobile iPhone 15 and almost zero upgrades to the iPhone 16 model as the main reason. Demand has been a major concern for the company since early 2023, and its holiday season sales forecast has also been below Wall Street estimates. Apple has also struggled in China’s market since the resurgence of Huawei. Being one of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, Apple’s plight weighed down on the tech sector and the broader market in general.\n\nConsequently, shares of Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD fell 1.4% and 6%, respectively. Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

When treasury yields go up, future valuations of mega-cap growth stocks like tech seem unreasonable, and it weighs on the sector.\n\nEconomic Data\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported that construction spending for November had increased 0.4% as opposed to a consensus of 0.6% for the period.

        "title": "As Wall Street Worries About PayPal Stock, You Should Be Buying!",
        "content": "The Street’s worries about PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock are way overdone. Eventually, these concerns, pushing the shares down 80% from their August 2021 high of $289, will become much less intense, enabling PYPL stock to soar far above its current levels. Specifically, investors’ trepidation about PayPal’s falling profit margins and its competition from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will eventually be unfounded. As a result, I view PYPL as a strong buy at its current levels.\n\nAlso importantly, the company’s new CEO is likely to boost the firm’s bottom line, while the valuation of PYPL stock remains extremely attractive.\n\nOverdone Concerns About Apple Pay\n\nIn July, research firm MoffettNathanson issued a negative note on PYPL stock, citing increasing competition from Apple’s Apple Pay. According to Barron’s, the bank reported that “Apple Pay is available on 80% of iOS apps, compared with 44% for PayPal. That could be a problem for PayPal given the ubiquity of Apple devices.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut globally, iPhone users spend an average of only $10.40 monthly on their apps, representing a small percentage of their total spending. And, of course, most of the world’s consumers actually have Android phones, not iPhone devices. Specifically, “Apple claims 650 million active App Store users while Google claims 2.5 billion active users.”\n\nMoreover, MoneyTransfers.com estimated in October that “Apple Pay’s market share of online payments is 6.21%.” Given that Apple Pay has been available for several years, the data point suggests that the service hardly represents a huge threat to PayPal, which had a 40% share as of last July.\n\nThe Street, which has tremendous reverence for Apple, tends to greatly estimate how much the firm’s offerings will grow and cause headaches for its competitors. For example, before Apple TV launched, many analysts were convinced that the service would dominate the streaming space. In fact, by my predictions at the time, it became barely more than a blip in the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nExcessive Worries About PayPal’s Margins\n\nThe Street has also been very concerned about a slight decline in PayPal’s margins, as its operating margin shrank from about 23% in Q2 2019 to 22.2% in Q3 2023. During the coronavirus pandemic, the company’s operating margin reached a high of 28%.\n\nLarge investors sometimes get obsessed with profit margins, causing the shares of companies whose margins are dropping to sink sharply. Eventually, however, increases in total profits usually cause stocks to climb. For evidence of that assertion, consider large oil companies, which have notoriously low margins but have generally managed to keep their stocks moving higher over the years.\n\nAnd PayPal’s profits have generally continued to climb meaningfully, jumping to $3.76 billion in the 12 months that ended in September 2023 from $2.42 billion in the 12 months that ended in September 2022.\n\nPYPL Stock: Cost Cutting and an Attractive Valuation\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, PayPal’s new CEO, Alex Chriss, said on Nov. 1, “Simply put, our cost base remains too high, it is actually slowing us down.” The CEO indicated he would sharply cut the firm’s costs going forward.\n\nAs PayPal reduces its spending, its margins will likely increase, making the Street more bullish on PYPL stock.\n\nFinally, PYPL stock has a very low, attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 11 times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 had a banner year. After a disastrous 2022 that saw the tech-laden index lose one-third of its value, it rebounded sharply in 2023 soaring 55% to hit a new all-time high. Of course, most of those gains were because of the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\nSince the index is market cap-weighted the relative size of the companies skewed the results. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone accounts for 9% of the Nasdaq 100 while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents another 8.6%. Together, the seven companies total over 38% of the index. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) called their performance the “defining feature of the equity market in 2023.”\n\nThat means last year’s Nasdaq 100 performance wasn’t very broad-based. It will be difficult for that select group of stocks to repeat their gains this year. Instead, quite a few undervalued tech stocks in the index will soar in 2024. Here are the top seven to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) used to be known as the “backbone of the internet” because of the role its routers and networking equipment played in keeping business online. Today the commoditization of hardware is a challenge. So are the rise of cloud computing and changing IT buying patterns. To address these issues, Cisco is evolving its software, cloud, and security strategy. It aims to transition the majority of its portfolio to everything-as-a-service over time. It calls the move Cisco+.\n\nThe software-focused approach could create large gains for the company in the long run, as it makes its revenue less cyclical, more recurring, and more profitable. It just delivered its strongest fiscal first quarter in company history. Revenue jumped 8% to $14.7 billion while profits raced 36% higher to $3.6 billion.\n\nCisco still needs to demonstrate its value proposition to its customers. By executing on its software, cloud, and security strategy, it can achieve its growth targets and retain its market leadership. With the stock trading at 12 times earnings estimates and 11x free cash flow (FCF), it’s presenting excellent value with tremendous upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nGilead Sciences (GILD) A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiopharmaceutical Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) develops and commercializes antiviral therapies for treating HIV, hepatitis, and cancer. Biktarvy for HIV is its lead drug, generating $3.1 billion in sales globally in the third quarter and $8.7 billion year-to-date. That’s up 17% from last year. A second treatment, Descovey, has $1.3 billion in sales over the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nThese drugs are offsetting the decline of older therapies like Veklury, which was the first FDA-approved antiviral for Covid-19. Although Gilead generated significant revenue from it in 2020 and 2021, sales are rapidly fading.\n\nThere is a dual-edged sword to the potential of its cell therapies Yescarta and Tecartus. On the one hand sales of the treatments are up 35% this year, but on the other the FDA is investigating potential issues with such chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapies. Cancer patients treated with CAR T-cell drugs reportedly developed lymphomas or other malignancies. Gilead operates a new automated CAR T-cell facility that just got FDA approval in April 2022. Fortunately, the therapies aren’t critical to Gilead’s current performance so far, but they are a future growth channel that could be at risk.\n\nThe biotech does have a healthy pipeline of treatments in clinical trials. So long as it can successfully launch and grow its new products, especially in the oncology and inflammatory segments, and leverage its existing portfolio and pipeline to diversify and strengthen its revenue streams, it got potential to rocket higher this year.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) doesn’t make chips itself but makes ion implantation systems that are critical to the chip-making process. It’s part of a duopoly with Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) offering a full range of implant products. Their international competitors don’t have the same breadth of products and services.\n\nThe booming semiconductor industry means there is more than enough business to go around. Axcelis sales jumped 25% so far this year with profits racing 39% higher. While the stock soared 63% in 2023 there’s good reason to believe it can continue climbing.\n\nDue to the heightened demand for electric vehicles (EV), renewable energy, and 5G applications, Axcelis can rapidly expand its share in the silicon carbide power market. It’s the only company with a product line that can deliver complete recipe coverage for all power device applications.\n\nIt also has a diversified customer base, including those for so-called trailing-edge processes. These are older and less advanced technologies still widely used for automotive, industrial, and Internet of Things applications but still have robust demand. Axcelis’ Purion line can support a wide range of implant applications, from 300mm to 200mm and smaller wafers.\n\nDespite its stock gains Axcelis still trades at 15 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its long-term earnings growth rate. There’s no reason it can’t rocket even higher next year.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity specialist Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is benefiting from the inexorable transition of data to the cloud. It provides cybersecurity solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government organizations. The number of security breaches hit record levels before the year even ended. Although the cybersecurity arena is becoming more competitive, Fortinet has several levers it can pull to dramatically increase growth.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI)-based cybersecurity market is expected to grow rapidly because of the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks. Fortinet invested heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities to enhance its threat detection, prevention, and response solutions. There had been a concern enterprise customers would cut back on cybersecurity spending if a recession loomed, but the damage to operations and reputation might prevent that from happening on too broad of a scale.\n\nFortinet can also leverage its Security Fabric platform, which integrates and automates security from network to cloud to endpoint. It says the platform enables customers to achieve higher levels of security, performance, and efficiency, while reducing complexity and costs. It’s also establishing itself as the industry leader in firewalls and software-defined wide area networks, or SD-WANs. It’s an emerging computer networking technology that connects data centers to branches and the cloud.\n\nFortinet’s stock isn’t cheap, but it still has the chance to expand its multiples even more in the year ahead.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had an impressive run in 2023 but should still be considered an undervalued tech stock. It is working to regain its technical edge over Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). New products including Emerald Rapids Xeon processors and Meteor Lake mobile processors aim to restore Intel’s superiority or at least gain technical parity. Similarly its new Gaudi3 AI chip puts Intel in the game with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD.\n\nIntel is also leveraging its chip manufacturing capabilities in the foundry business to provide chip fabrication services to other companies. It counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the U.S. Defense Dept. as clients. The fact that it is primarily based in the U.S. gives it a competitive edge in the wake of global geopolitical uncertainty that’s disrupted supply chains worldwide. It also has a new fab facility in Europe to expand its capacity and meet growing chip demand there.\n\nIntel’s data center business faced challenges in recent years due to increased competition, innovation, and market shifts. However, that is expected to recover. Similarly, the expected debut in 2024 of AI PCs could revive the industry. These are just some of the growth levers available to Intel to pull in 2024.\n\nExpedia (EXPE) Expedia app logo on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline travel stock Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) took a long trip higher in 2023. Shares rose 80% with most of the gains beginning in November on travel demand returning to pre-pandemic levels. Expedia beat analyst profit estimates and recorded record revenue in the third quarter.\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association, overall traveler numbers will exceed pre-Covid levels. They are expected to reach 4 billion in 2024. Passenger volume is projected to hit 9.4 billion passengers worldwide this year, surpassing 2019’s 9.2 billion.\n\nExpedia remains one of the leading online travel companies with well-known brands including its namesake Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, and Egencia. Despite last year’s gains the online travel agency trades at a lower valuation than its peers and its own historical averages. The stock goes for just 12 earnings estimates and 11 times free cash flow. Profit margins and cash flow generation, however, are stronger than some rivals like Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Moreover, Expedia can use platforms like Vrbo to further encroach on territory already held by Airbnb.\n\nLook for Expedia to continue rebounding in 2024 as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic and adapts to the new normal.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo paraphrase Mark Twain, the rumor of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) death has been greatly exaggerated. In fact, Netflix actually won the streaming wars. While competing services like Disney‘s (NYSE:DIS) Disney+ and Paramount Global‘s (NASDAQ:PARA) Paramount+ burst on the scene during the pandemic with great fanfare, they haven’t been able to maintain their momentum.\n\nAnalysts believed movie studios getting into streaming would undercut Netflix ability to survive. Pulling content from the platform for their own streaming services would starve Netflix of content. As it turns out, there really hasn’t been enough of a reason to continue subscribing to these rivals while Netflix is still expanding. It ended the third quarter with 247 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nAlthough it was believed Netflix cracking down on password sharing could damage its business, that’s not the case either. It has an opportunity to grow even more by converting an estimated 100 million users into paying customers. Advertising is another huge opportunity, though CFO Spencer Neumann told Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) says Netflix is still “the crawl of the crawl-walk-run stage” of both growth levers.\n\nNetflix has also shown it possesses superb pricing power. It avoided increasing customer churn by responsibly increasing subscription costs. This is a trio of opportunities the streamer can continue to press to its advantage this year. It’s stock is not the cheapest either, but having survived the streaming wars and come out on top again indicates Netflix is an undervalued tech stock that can keep growing in the year ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "47% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "It might surprise investors that 47% of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is in one stock. For an investment manager who preaches the virtues of diversification, this decision seems counterintuitive, to say the least, especially when one can easily assume that an artificial intelligence (AI) stock would imply higher risks.\n\nHowever, it might also relieve some investors to know that the stock is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the largest publicly traded company by market cap. Here's why Buffett's team seems to stick with this tech giant and why it will likely remain a Berkshire Hathaway mainstay for some time to come.\n\nAI, Apple, and Berkshire Hathaway\n\nAdmittedly, Buffett's team has not appeared to target AI stocks directly but rather focuses on solid companies that also happen to utilize AI. Other so-called \"Buffett AI stocks,\" such as Amazon and Snowflake, combined comprise less than 1% of Berkshire's portfolio. Also, while Buffett belatedly embraced technology stocks long ago, Apple is his company's only tech position valued at over $10 billion.\n\nNonetheless, Apple has become a significant investor in AI. Virtually all of its latest products and services apply AI on some level. The company has also long funded doctorial fellowships through its Apple Scholars program, which makes it a major force on the research front.\n\nMoreover, its push into AI could indirectly influence Buffett's team to hold the stock. AI controls one of the primary smartphone operating systems. To this end, AI can help improve the user experience, for instance, by powering the Siri neural network and Face ID. Also, since Apple designs its chips, it has numerous options to integrate AI into its products in ways we do not know.\n\nApple's financials and AI\n\nInvestors should also focus on the virtuous cycle fostered by Apple and its AI. The company's current liquidity stands at about $162 billion after factoring in unrealized losses on short-term investments. This gives the company tremendous optionality when funding AI research and initiatives and can help Apple buy the technology it cannot successfully produce. Its products and related services helped it generate a net income of $97 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30).\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough net income suffered a 3% yearly decline in a sluggish consumer economy, the company generated nearly $100 billion in free cash flow during the fiscal year. Much of this money will likely find its way back into AI research, improving its products and bolstering the company's net income and free cash flow.\n\nThe virtuous cycle also helped translate into gains for shareholders, as Apple stock rose by just over 50% in 2023. That took its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to around 32, a level close to multiyear highs. Nonetheless, it maintains a lower valuation than Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia and one just slightly higher than Google-parent Alphabet, indicating the market has fairly valued the company.\n\nBerkshire's Apple investment\n\nInvestors should consider Apple an AI stock, but it is likely not a direct reason for Berkshire Hathaway to hold such a massive position in the company. Indeed, its research in AI and its AI-driven applications make Apple a leader in the field. And as AI has become essential to investors, the company has more explicitly linked AI to product functionality.\n\nHowever, the popularity of its products and the company's financials are the likely reasons for Berkshire to place this unprecedented level of trust in Apple. To this end, investors should expect Berkshire's focus to remain on Apple's financials and not on its AI directly.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

(Reuters / Reuters)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nShares in Apple were lower in extended trading after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker and lowered its price target for shares of the company on fears of slowing iPhone 15 sales in China.\n\n“We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables,” Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\n“The biggest takeaway from the latest checks is incrementally worse [iPhone 15] data points out of China, together with developed markets remaining soft,” he added.\n\nRead more: FTSE celebrates its 40th anniversary with a bump as Europe opens flat\n\nShares fell 3.6% on Tuesday, their biggest one-day percentage drop since September, and the decline erased more than $107bn (£84.79bn) in market value.\n\nRivian (RIVN)\n\nRivian shares slipped in extended trading after the electric-vehicle startup reported fourth-quarter and full-year delivery and production numbers.\n\nRivian reported Tuesday it had delivered 13,972 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023, falling a hair short of the 14,000 forecasted by analysts.\n\nShares plunged 10% in regular trading but brokerage firm Baird still calls the stock the “best idea” for 2024, with a price target of $30.\n\nWhile an earlier-than-expected bond issuance in October had sent Rivian's stock plunging on fears over its financial health, the company is widely seen as better placed among the EV startups.\n\nModerna (MRNA)\n\nModerna shares were trending higher in extended trading after Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to 'Outperform' and raised its price target to $142 per share, implying a more than 40% gain from Friday's closing price.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh said the company’s COVID sales could hit a low point in 2024 due to factors such as vaccine fatigue. But the firm expects COVID vaccine sales to rise in 2025 and beyond as education about COVID and spending on awareness about the disease increase.\n\nSingh told Yahoo Finance he was even more upbeat about Moderna’s pipeline potential, highlighting a handful of possible product launches over the next 12 to 18 months that could boost sales in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of the company slumped nearly 45% in 2023, marking their worst annual performance to date, weighed down by weak sales of its COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nGSK (GSK.L)\n\nIn London, GSK surged almost by 2% as Jefferies took a more positive view of the pharmaceuticals company.\n\nJefferies analysts said in a research note that GSK is expected to guide for at least low single-digit EPS growth for 2024 and settle the Zantac litigation case within the coming months.\n\nRead more: UK food price inflation falls at record pace\n\nJefferies raises its target price on the stock to 1,900 pence from 1,550 pence.\n\nIn terms of valuation, GSK is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 9.63, a discount from the industry’s average of 22.86.\n\nWatch: Consider a 'dry January' for your finances: Financial advisor</p>\\n<p>Irwin advises consumers to “understand what your cashflow is and make a budget,” to gain insight on spending practices.

        "title": "3 Safe Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "With the coming of a new year, many people resolve to better themselves in one way or another. For many, that includes improving their families' financial situations. Some of them might be considering some high-risk options, but there are safe ways to do it too.\n\nIf you're looking for a low-risk way to generate more income from your investments in 2024, read on. Here are three stocks that have what it takes to safely deliver growing streams of dividends to their shareholders in the years ahead -- and all three stocks are solid buys today.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWhen it comes to limiting risk for investors, a company's financial fortitude is of the utmost importance. It's here where Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) excels. The iPhone maker's profit and cash-flow generation are simply incomparable, even among its megacap tech peers.\n\nApple's well-designed hardware and software integrate seamlessly to create consistently excellent customer experiences. It's a simple but difficult-to-replicate formula for success -- one that's helped Apple amass a global customer base that includes over 2 billion installed devices and 1 billion paid subscriptions.\n\nBetter still, once someone buys an Apple device, they tend to buy another. These loyal customers drive the company's incredible financial results.\n\nThe tech giant produced a staggering $383 billion in revenue and $97 billion in net income over the trailing 12 months. This stunning profitability combined with a fortress-like balance sheet -- Apple's cash reserves and investments stood at a whopping $162 billion as of Sept. 30 -- enabled it to reward its shareholders with $15 billion in dividends and $78 billion in share repurchases during its last fiscal year alone.\n\nAll in all, Apple has grown its cash payout to investors by 120% over the past decade. With the artificial intelligence (AI) boom likely to drive a powerful tech upgrade cycle, you can expect this proven wealth-builder to continue to grow its profits and dividends in the years ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Lockheed Martin\n\nThough we may wish it weren't true, the reality of the world today is that no nation is safe without a strong national security strategy. As a leading defense contractor, Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) helps countries protect their citizens from those who would do them harm.\n\nLockheed's F-35 stealth aircraft serves a central role in the global security strategies of the U.S. military and 17 allied nations. Lockheed also helps to produce many of the defensive systems that have helped Ukraine withstand Russia's invasion, such as the Javelin anti-tank system and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). In addition to the strong demand for these proven platforms, Lockheed's broad product lineup -- which includes drones, helicopters, cargo planes, and spacecraft -- helps to further reduce the risks for investors.\n\nThe long service lives of many of its products provide Lockheed with a level of visibility and predictability into its future revenue that few other businesses possess. The F-35, for example, is expected to remain in service until 2070.\n\nThe reliable cash flow from these product lines enables the defense titan to pay a steadily growing dividend to its shareholders (currently yielding 2.7%). Lockheed has increased its cash payout for 21 consecutive years.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nConsumers may be reducing their consumption of sugary drinks, but Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is doing just fine. The beverage colossus is far more than just a seller of soda -- and sales of its broad range of drinks continue to grow.\n\nCoca-Cola offers a broad array of healthier drinks, such as tea, coffee, milk, and nutrient-enhanced water. Gold Peak, Costa Coffee, Fairlife, and Vitaminwater count among the company's collection of popular brands.\n\nCoca-Cola's powerful global marketing and distribution system enables it to adapt to shifting consumer tastes. Roughly 25% of its gross profit growth in 2023 was attributed to its innovation efforts.\n\nMoreover, management's margin expansion initiatives are bearing fruit. Coca-Cola has divested most of its bottling operations in recent years. These and other efficiency-boosting efforts helped to expand the company's adjusted operating margin to nearly 30%, up from 26.5% in 2017.\n\nAll told, Coca-Cola's revenue and free cash flow are up an annualized 7% and 14%, respectively, over the past half-decade. This steady growth helped Coca-Cola extend its impressive streak of consecutive annual dividend increases to 61 years.\n\nEven larger cash payouts likely lie ahead for investors. Coca-Cola's core markets are projected to expand by 4% to 10% annually in the coming years. Management, in turn, expects the company's sales and earnings per share to grow by as much as 6% and 9%, respectively, per year. And more profits should mean bigger dividends for Coca-Cola's shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Coming: 2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy as Part of Your New Year's Resolution",
        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500 index plunged into a bear market in 2022 when it fell more than 20% from its all-time high. But following a strong 2023, it recovered nearly all of that lost ground.\n\nThe index is on the cusp of setting a new record high, which would mark the official beginning of a new bull market. It only needs a gain of 0.5% to get there. Data source: YCharts.\n\nHistory suggests 2024 will likely be another positive year for the stock market, which would practically guarantee the S&P 500 enters bull territory. With that in mind, here's why investors might want to begin the year with shares of the world's two largest companies: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft was founded in 1975 as a software company, and it went public in 1986 valued at $777 million. After expanding into hardware, gaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) over the last 48 years, Microsoft amassed a valuation of $2.8 trillion. It trails only Apple for the title of world's largest company.\n\nThat significant value creation prompted Microsoft to execute nine stock splits since 1987 to ensure its shares remained accessible to small investors -- who might be grateful right now, considering it soared 57% in 2023, doubling the return of the S&P 500. And 2024 could be another strong year as the company ramps up efforts to monetize its growing portfolio of AI products.\n\nManagement started 2023 with a bang when it agreed to invest $10 billion in top generative AI start-up OpenAI, which is responsible for the ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft has since embedded that technology into its Windows operating system, Edge internet browser, Bing search engine, Microsoft 365 document suite, and Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nAzure OpenAI Service allows businesses to access OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models to help them build their own AI applications. The service started calendar year 2023 with just 200 customers, but within nine months, over 18,000 organizations had signed up. I anticipate that number will grow significantly this year as businesses race to embed AI into their operations to boost efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is also running an early-access program for its ChatGPT-powered Copilot technology in Microsoft 365 applications. Now, businesses can harness the power of AI in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams for $30 per employee, per month. The company says 40% of the Fortune 500 companies are participating in the early-access program, including giants like Visa and KPMG.\n\nAccording to Statista, over 1.3 million companies use Microsoft 365, so the ability to charge them more for AI-enabled versions could be a seismic financial opportunity.\n\nMicrosoft's fiscal 2024 will end on June 30 this year. Wall Street analysts estimate the company will deliver $243 billion in revenue, an increase of 14.8% year over year. Its earnings per share are expected to jump 14.5% to $11.24.\n\nIt places the stock at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.5, which is a slight premium to the Nasdaq-100 technology index. However, the company's presence in AI might still warrant further gains. Leading Wall Street technology analyst Dan Ives at Wedbush recently named Microsoft as his top pick, and he thinks the stock could hit $450 in 2024 thanks to AI. That implies an upside of almost 20%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple was founded in 1976, and it went public in 1980 valued at $1.8 billion. It now generates that much in revenue every 40 hours, and it became the first company in history to amass a $3 trillion valuation.\n\nLike Microsoft, it has created so much value that its management executed five stock splits since 1987 to keep its shares accessible to small investors.\n\nThe catalyst behind the bulk of Apple's market value is the iPhone, which was introduced in 2007. It has taken consumers on a journey packed with innovation, like the smartphone's high-resolution displays, its camera technology, and its app ecosystem. But the latest iPhone 15 lineup sets the stage for what could be the next big value creator: on-device artificial intelligence.\n\nThe iPhone 15 is fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro processor, which is the smartphone industry's first 3-nanometer chip. Simply put, the brain of the iPhone is now smaller, faster, and more efficient than ever.\n\nIts neural engine, which processes AI and machine-learning workloads, delivers a twofold performance boost over its predecessor, the A16 Bionic. That allows the iPhone to manage AI workloads independently of the cloud or third-party computing services, which many AI applications currently rely upon.\n\nIt will open the door to powerful advancements in features like the Siri voice assistant, predictive text, and Visual Lookup -- a camera tool capable of identifying faces, plants, and even famous landmarks.\n\nHowever, Apple is rumored to be working on its own large language models and even a generative AI application called Apple GPT. Details remain scarce, but imagine having a ChatGPT-style tool woven throughout every aspect of your iPhone, processed using the device's own chip hardware. The possibilities will be endless; it could craft your messages and emails, or even create image and video content for you.\n\nAI isn't the only area in which Apple is innovating. It's gearing up to launch its new virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro, in the early part of this year. It's priced at $3,499, so it probably won't sell in high volumes initially, but it's Apple's first new product category since it launched its watch in 2015. It gives developers an opportunity to build new gaming and entertainment experiences, which could attract consumers to this new platform.\n\nWall Street estimates Apple will generate $396 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending Sept. 30, 2024), which would mark a gain of just 3.5% year over year. While it sounds sluggish, there's an even bigger force likely to keep Apple stock afloat: The company continues to return truckloads of money to shareholders. It bought back $77.5 billion worth of its own stock in fiscal 2023, and paid out $15 billion in dividends. That's music to the ears of its largest investors, which include Warren Buffett.\n\nApple has always been a long-term story. It isn't very agile given its enormous size; it's more like an aircraft carrier that takes time to maneuver. But 2024 will likely be one of the company's most exciting years as it lays more groundwork for its AI initiatives, and consumers interact with the Vision Pro platform at scale for the first time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nearly 80% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in These 6 Stocks as 2024 Begins",
        "content": "Things will probably feel different for Warren Buffett in 2024. It's the first year in decades that he won't have his longtime business partner Charlie Munger to call as a sounding board. Munger died in November at age 99.\n\nBut in other respects, the new year will likely be similar for Buffett to years past. For example, as has been the case for quite a while, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has especially large stakes in only a handful of holdings. Nearly 80% of Berkshire's portfolio is invested in six stocks as 2024 begins.\n\n1. Apple\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising that Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains Buffett's top stock by far. The tech giant makes up 47% of Berkshire's total portfolio, with a valuation of around $170 billion.\n\nApple was a huge winner for Buffett in 2023, soaring 48%. However, the stock got off to a rocky start in the new year after Barclays downgraded it to underweight. Buffett probably won't pay any attention at all to Wall Street's views, though. He continues to view Apple as one of the best businesses in the world.\n\n2. Bank of America\n\nBuffett's enamor with bank stocks has waned somewhat in recent years, but not with Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). It's his No. 2 stock, making up 9.6% of Berkshire's portfolio, with the position valued at roughly $34.7 billion.\n\nBank of America eked out a small gain in 2023 after getting clobbered earlier in the year by the banking crisis. The big bank remains strong financially, though. It also continues to be a top innovator in the financial services sector. Don't expect BofA to give up its spot as Buffett's second-favorite stock in 2024.\n\n3. American Express\n\nBuffett has owned shares of American Express(NYSE: AXP) longer than every other stock except one. It's also his third-largest holding, comprising 7.8% of Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nWall Street isn't especially bullish about American Express in the new year. Only 10 of the 28 analysts surveyed by LSEG in January rated the stock as a buy or a strong buy. I doubt that Buffett will add to Berkshire's position anytime soon, but I don't expect him to sell Amex, either.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. The Coca-Cola Company\n\nWhat's the one stock that Buffett has owned longer than American Express? The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO). He initiated a position in Coca-Cola in 1988. It's now Berkshire's fourth-biggest holding, making up 6.6% of the portfolio.\n\nCoca-Cola wasn't a winner for Buffett in 2023. However, it's made him a lot of money through the years. The stock will continue to do so in 2024 even if its share price doesn't go anywhere thanks to its dividend. Coca-Cola paid Berkshire a whopping $184 million in dividends in December.\n\n5. Chevron\n\nBuffett trimmed Berkshire's position in Chevron(NYSE: CVX) last year. However, the big oil and gas stock still made up 4.6% of Berkshire's portfolio, putting it in the No. 5 spot overall.\n\nChevron's shares fell nearly 17% in 2023. However, that sell-off (largely on the news of the company's plan to acquire Hess) appears to be overdone. If oil prices hold up, Buffett could see positive returns from Chevron in the new year.\n\n6. Occidental Petroleum\n\nOccidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) is one oil stock that Buffett continued to buy in 2023. It now ranks as Berkshire's sixth-largest position, making up 4.1% of the conglomerate's total portfolio.\n\nDon't be surprised if Buffett scoops up even more Occidental shares in 2024. Berkshire has regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of the company, but its stake currently totals only 27.8%.\n\nMost likely to succeed in the new year?\n\nI think that American Express and Occidental Petroleum are the two stocks among Berkshire's top holdings that are the most likely to succeed in the new year. Both stocks are attractively valued. Both should also benefit if the U.S. economy performs relatively well in 2024, as many economists predict.\n\nIf I had to pick just one of these stocks, though, I'd go with Occidental. My view is that Berkshire will indeed expand its stake in the company this year, helping push shares higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Hottest Blue-Chip Stocks to Watch in 2024",
        "content": "Last year was more for stock pickers than a year where all sectors and stocks surged. Further, there were multi-bagger returns from blue-chip as well as growth stocks. Among the hottest blue-chips, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) skyrocketed by almost 240%. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock also had a healthy rally of 48%. These were some blue-chips that outperformed many growth stocks.\n\nFor the current year, I expect a similar trend. It’s unlikely that there will be a euphoric market rally. However, there will be stories that grab the limelight and surge higher. Potential rate cuts in the year’s second half will be a catalyst for upside in several stocks.\n\nAmong blue-chip stocks, this column discusses three ideas that can trend higher by 30% to 50% before the end of 2024. These are fundamentally strong stories that have positive tailwinds.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s discuss the reasons for bullish on these hot blue-chip stocks.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Interior of the Tesla Model 3\n\nSource: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was in a comeback mode last year with a rally of over 100%. I believe TSLA will be among the hottest blue-chips this year. It’s worth noting that in July 2023, the stock touched highs of $300. This has been followed by some correction and consolidation, and TSLA stock trades at $250. Backed by positive business news, I expect a renewed rally.\n\nEven amidst scaling-up challenges, Cybertruck mass deliveries in the coming quarters will be a growth catalyst. There are speculations that the current backlog is over two million and the Cybertruck will be sold out for years to come.\n\nAnother interesting development on the cards is the possibility of Tesla’s first plant in India in the state of Gujarat. There is a possibility of the potential launch of affordable cars as Tesla explores new emerging markets.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Tesla has a strong balance sheet with $27 billion in cash and equivalents. Further, for the first nine months of 2023, Tesla reported operating cash flow of $8.9 billion. With high financial flexibility, Tesla is well-positioned to make some big investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock\n\nSource: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsidering the upside in gold and the possibility of multiple rate cuts this year, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is among the hottest blue-chip to buy. NEM stock has been subdued with negative returns of 12% in the last 12 months. I am betting on a 30% to 50% upside from current levels in the coming quarters.\n\nAn obvious reason to like Newmont is an investment grade balance sheet. The Company has a strong liquidity buffer of $6.2 billion. Further, net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDAX of 0.7 points to headroom for leveraging. Recently, the Company completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining (OTCMKTS:NCMGF). This will help in boosting production and cash flows.\n\nIt’s worth noting that for the first nine months of 2023, Newmont reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion. With an upside in the gold price, Newmont is likely to deliver an annual EBITDA of more than $4 billion this year. An increase in cash flows will be associated with healthy dividend growth.\n\nChevron Corporation (CVX) Chevron (CVX) sing with \"diesel,\" \"food mart\" and \"car wash\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is another blue-chip stock that has been depressed in the last 12 months. The reason is a correction in crude oil prices on the back of global growth deceleration. However, with potential rate cuts, there are hopes of growth acceleration in 2025. This factor will likely be discounted in crude oil in the coming quarters. I, therefore, expect a strong comeback for CVX stock.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Chevron is on an aggressive investment spree. For the current year, the Company expects to invest $16 billion. However, the target is to scale up capital investments in the range of $19 to $22 billion once the acquisition of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is completed. Robust investments coupled with acquisitions will ensure production growth and a healthy reserve replacement.\n\nAn important point is that Chevron can invest $22 billion annually from internal cash flows. Even with the relatively depressed oil price, Chevron reported an operating cash flow of $9.7 billion for Q3 2023. Cash flows are likely to swell this year and provide ample headroom for aggressive investments coupled with dividend growth. All in all, it’s one of those hottest blue-chips stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Futures edge lower, Tesla's China-made EV sales surge - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point lower on Wednesday after a mostly downbeat start to 2024 in the prior session. Markets are now awaiting the publication of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting and, with it, potential clues into the central bank's interest rate path in the coming months. Elsewhere, sales of Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) China-made cars soar in December, but Elon Musk's electric vehicle giant is still grappling with fierce competition in the country.\n\n1. Futures inch lower\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down on Wednesday, as investors looked ahead to the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.\n\nBy 05:09 ET (10:09 GMT), the Dow futures contract had dipped by 56 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had shed 11 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had fallen by 76 points or 0.4%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both lost ground in the first day of trading of 2024, weighed down in part by ebbing hopes that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts early this year. Meanwhile, the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just under 0.1%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sunk by around 4% after analysts at Barclays downgraded their rating of the iPhone maker, citing weak hardware demand and concerns over revenue at its services division. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- who, along with Apple, form part of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech firms that helped drive a stellar 2023 for stocks -- also declined.\n\n\"The impressive rally into year[-]end has faded a bit despite the seasonal tailwinds, but we expect the loss of short[-]term momentum to be modest,\" analysts at Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients.\n\n2. U.S. Treasury yields climb\n\nAlso denting stocks on Tuesday was a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, in a possible sign that markets' excitement over the prospect of Fed rate cuts early this year may be easing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year note -- a key gauge of long-term estimates for borrowing costs -- briefly touched an over two-week high, while the yield rate-sensitive 2-year also moved up. Prices typically fall as yields increase.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield was under 3.9% following a strong rally to cap off the year that was driven by expectations for early Fed rate cuts and a so-called \"soft landing\" for the U.S. economy. In this scenario, the Fed's aggressive rate hiking campaign successfully cools inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.\n\nBolstered by the jump in Treasury yields, the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its currency pairs, had its best daily performance since March 2023.\n\n3. Fed minutes ahead\n\nTraders are now turning their attention to the minutes from the Fed's December gathering, which are due out at 19:00 GMT on Wednesday.\n\nHow officials see borrowing costs evolving in the coming months could factor into the staying power of recent bets that the U.S. central bank will soon begin to bring down interest rates from a more than two-decade high.\n\nIn December, the Fed left rates unaltered at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, but signaled that its unprecedented tightening cycle aimed at corraling elevated inflation may have peaked. New forecasts from policymakers also suggested that they may slash rates by 75 basis points this year, an outlook that was more dovish than prior projections.\n\nSpeculation over potential rate reductions fueled a late-year surge in stocks, although many officials have since attempted to temper this enthusiasm. The minutes could provide even more insight into the Fed's thinking.\n\n4. Sales of Tesla's China-made EVs surge in December\n\nSales of Tesla's electric vehicles (EVs) made in China surged by 68.7% on a yearly basis last month, new data from the China Passenger Car Association showed on Wednesday, although the U.S. carmaker still faces intense competition in the country.\n\nThe December total, which includes exports, brought Tesla's annual amount of China-made sales up to 947,742 -- just over half of the company's global deliveries.\n\nTesla's Shanghai plant is its largest production hub, supplying China and other countries like New Zealand and Australia. The group has outlined plans to expand its EV capacity at the factory, but the move has yet to receive regulatory approval from Beijing.\n\nThe latest CPCA numbers come after China's BYD (SZ:002594) unseated Tesla as the world's biggest EV maker earlier this week. BYD, who offers both battery-only and hybrid options, delivered 341,043 passenger cars in December, an increase of 45% year-on-year.\n\n5. Oil slips\n\nOil prices retreated Wednesday, ahead of the release of crucial weekly inventories data from the U.S., the world’s largest consumer.\n\nBy 05:09 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $69.94 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.5% to $75.53 per barrel.\n\nU.S. crude stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute industry group are due later Wednesday, a day later than usual due to Monday’s New Year’s holiday. Official data will then be published on Thursday.\n\nThe crude benchmarks had climbed sharply earlier in the week after attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels raised concerns over potential supply disruptions through this key region.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures edge lower, Tesla's China-made EV sales surge - what's moving markets\n\nFed minutes may elaborate on coming rate cut debate\n\nPoliticisation of trade is immoral and unsustainable, China says",

        "title": "Down 77% from Highs, Can Coupang Stock (NYSE:CPNG) Recover in 2024?",
        "content": "While the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index (NDX) surged 43% in 2023, many of these gains were driven by mega-cap stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, e-commerce stocks such as Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) trailed the broader markets. CPNG stock rose “just” 10% in 2023 and is 77% below its all-time high. While Coupang has underperformed since its 2021 IPO, I’m bullish on the stock for 2024 due to its expanding addressable market, strong revenue growth, and improving profit margin.\n\nAn Overview of Coupang\n\nCoupang is a South Korea-based e-commerce company. It has two primary business segments, including Product Commerce and Developing Offerings. Coupang sells various products and services across categories such as home goods, apparel, beauty, home goods, electronics, and more.\n\nAdditionally, Coupang offers Rocket Fresh, a grocery delivery platform, while Coupang Eats provides restaurant ordering and delivery services. The tech company also has Coupang Play, an online content streaming platform.\n\nIn order to boost customer engagement rates, Coupang has invested heavily in infrastructure and technology. It has built more than 100 fulfillment centers spanning roughly 50 million square feet, housing millions of products. Coupang emphasized that 70% of the Korean population lives within seven miles of a Coupang logistics center.\n\nThe company now aims to leverage its capabilities in artificial intelligence and machine learning to better predict consumer demand, enabling it to deploy products across its network of fulfillment centers. Coupang is also banking on technology to dynamically route hundreds of millions of orders efficiently.\n\nHow Were Coupang’s Recent Q3 Results?\n\nDespite a challenging macro environment in 2023, Coupang increased its net revenues by 21% year-over-year to $6.2 billion in Q3. Further, the number of active customers on the Coupang platform grew by 14% to 20.4 million in the quarter. Comparatively, its gross profits rose by 27% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, indicating a margin of 25.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoupang ended the September quarter with an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $239 million, indicating a margin of 3.9%. In the last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA stood at $991 million, as it improved margins by 490 basis points.\n\nUnlike several other e-commerce tech stocks, Coupang has been reporting positive cash flows consistently. In the last four quarters, Coupang’s operating cash flow stood at $2.6 billion, while free cash flow was $1.9 billion, indicating that the company spent $700 million in capital expenditures.\n\nIn the year-ago period, Coupang reported an operating cash outflow of $200 million, while its free cash outflow was much higher at $1 billion.\n\nCoupang stated that its revenue and active customer growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter in Q3, as its Developing Offerings generated 40% revenue growth in the quarter. Moreover, Coupang expanded Rocket Delivery in Taiwan and helped around 12,000 small businesses to export products to new markets in the last 12 months.\n\nDuring the company’s recent earnings call, CEO Gaurav Anand stated, “We’ve expanded profitability while making investments in Developing Offerings, and we expect our consolidated margin to continue its march upwards on an annual basis.”\n\nCoupang Acquires Farfetch\n\nLast month, Coupang announced the acquisition of Farfetch Holdings, an online luxury company. The acquisition positions Coupang as a leader in the global personal luxury goods segment valued at $400 billion.\n\nCoupang believes its operational excellence and innovative logistics network, combined with Farfetch’s widening ecosystem in the luxury market, should help it drive experiences for customers and brands globally.\n\nAlternatively, the acquisition of Farfetch might strain Coupang’s balance sheet. In the first six months of 2023, Farfetch lost over $440 million while sales stood at $1.1 billion.\n\nThe acquisition agreement will provide Farfetch with $500 million of capital, shoring up the company’s liquidity in the near term.\n\nIs Coupang Stock Undervalued?\n\nAnalysts tracking Coupang stock expect its sales to rise by 17% to $24.08 billion for 2023 and by 13.3% to $27.27 billion for full-year 2024. Comparatively, it is forecast to end 2024 with adjusted earnings of $0.44 per share compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 expected for 2023.\n\nSo, priced at 1.2x forward sales and 37.1x 2024 earnings, CPNG stock is not too expensive, given its growth estimates.\n\nHowever, there is a good chance that the acquisition of Farfetch might result in lower profit margins for the e-commerce player. Nonetheless, Coupang ended Q3 with $4.9 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in debt, providing it with enough liquidity to navigate the current macro environment and acquire Farfetch.\n\nIs CPNG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOut of the six analysts covering CPNG stock, two recommend a Buy, three recommend a Hold, and one recommends a Sell. The average CPNG stock price target is $19.52, which is 24.1% above the current price.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nCoupang is among the largest e-commerce companies in South Korea, and it will gain access to several other markets once the acquisition of Farfetch is closed. I expect the stock to gain momentum in the next 12 months, especially if it can successfully integrate Farfetch and benefit from operational synergies as well as stable profit margins.\n\nDisclosure",

Both indexes logged heavy losses in 2023.\n\nBroader Asian stocks fell on Wednesday, with the technology sector seeing the heaviest losses following a rout in U.S. majors.\n\nWall St rout, Apple losses hit Asian tech stocks\n\nTech-heavy indexes were the worst performers in Asia. South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.7%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index shed 1.1%.\n\nLosses in major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers also weighed on Asian bourses, after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker citing a looming slowdown in device sales.\n\nHeavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930), AAC Technologies (OTC:AACAY) Holdings Inc (HK:2018) and SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) fell between 2% and 3%, while TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM)- the world’s biggest contract chipmaker- sank 2.4% in Taiwan trade.\n\nTech stocks were also pressured by anticipation of the minutes of the Fed’s December meeting, which were due later on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts warned that the minutes may not strike as dovish a chord as markets were hoping. While the central bank had signaled rate cuts in 2024, it had given scant cues on the timing of said cuts.\n\nFed officials also recently warned that expectations for early rate cuts were overly optimistic, given that inflation and the labor market were still running hot.\n\nExpectations of early interest rate cuts had driven strong gains in global stock markets through December. But this also made stock markets vulnerable to a sharp pullback on any doubts over the early rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the CME Fedwatch tool showed traders still pricing in a nearly 70% chance for a 25 basis point cut in March.\n\nMarkets were also awaiting key nonfarm payrolls data this week, which is expected to show some cooling in the labor space. But markets remained on edge over a stronger reading, given that payrolls almost consistently beat expectations through most of 2023.\n\n“Friday's payrolls report can be pivotal here, but based off consensus expectations the market will remain without validation from the labour market. Also, the Fed's FOMC minutes due on Wednesday are unlikely to be as racy as Chair Powell was at the press conference,” analysts at ING wrote in a note.\n\nBroader Asian markets tracked weakness in Wall Street. Australia’s ASX 200 sank 1% from a 2-½ year high.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a weak open, with the index likely to see more profit-taking after logging stellar gains in 2023. Heavyweight Indian tech stocks such as Infosys (NS:INFY) and HCL Technologies Ltd (NS:HCLT) were also set to track their U.S. peers.\n\nJapanese markets were closed for a week-long holiday. But futures for the Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4%.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "title": "Wall Street’s 7 Favorite Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "As we enter 2024, it’s wise to pause and reevaluate your investment portfolio, shaking things up for the year ahead. With each new year comes shifting sentiment on Wall Street. However, many top-performing stocks from 2023 could continue gaining momentum this year. Tracking which companies analysts are most bullish on provides useful insight for investors with medium-term investing time horizons.\n\nBig tech stocks often land on analysts’ buy lists, some after already appreciating significantly. While these familiar names may not make you an overnight millionaire, they should anchor your portfolio. I’ll spotlight seven stocks that Wall Street analysts have tagged as hot buys for 2024 based on positive ratings. Note, a reminder: analyst ratings aren’t foolproof market prophecies. However, they do offer a valuable peek into current Wall Street perspectives.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s dive in!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the top dog in the e-commerce sector by a wide margin, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains analysts’ darling pick in this space for 2024. With a stellar 42 “buy” ratings against zero “hold” or “sell” ratings over the last three months, Wall Street is extremely bullish on AMZN stock. I know some may balk at Amazon’s seemingly steep valuation. But with online shopping becoming more ingrained for the consumer (especially among digital-native Gen Zers), I’m willing to pay a premium for this proven winner.\n\nStatistaforecasts nearly 11% annualized global e-commerce growth through 2027, and Amazon should capture much of those dollars. The company’s earnings per share are estimated to grow from $2.69 in 2023 to more than $11.30 by 2032. To me, that long-term profit trajectory justifies Amazon’s current market value, and then some. Paired with low double-digit sales growth expected through 2029, I see ample upside ahead.\n\nBetween Gen Z’s digital preferences and the overall momentum of e-commerce, Amazon’s pole position in this space should equate to big returns over time. This tech titan remains as hungry as ever – a terrific stock to own in 2024 and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlashback to mid-2022 when Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) crashed to $90 per share. Despite the prevalent bearishness at the time, I stayed bullish on this company based on Meta’s rock-solid core business. Fast forward 18 months, and META stock is now trading around $346 per share.\n\nWall Street sees blue skies ahead as well. In fact, Meta nets 36 “buy” recommendations against just one “hold.” From 2023 to 2028, the company’s earnings per share could double on the back of still-robust double-digit annual revenue growth. Indeed, lingering anxiety over Meta’s metaverse dreams has proven temporary. The company’s “Family of Apps” division, not virtual reality, is Meta’s cash cow, and that business is doing just fine.\n\nMeta’s coffers will continue to grow so long as eyeballs remain glued to Facebook and Instagram. Consider Generation Z: though often portrayed as generally being “over” Facebook, most in these age groups still have an account. Additionally, Instagram remains wildly popular with teens. As long as users show up, advertisers will, too. With ample room for untapped global growth, Meta has plenty of upside left.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) retains its spot as a darling among Wall Street analysts, and for good reason. This tech titan scarcely flinched during the recent overall market slide and has rebounded forcefully to fresh highs. While Microsoft’s impressive AI initiatives capture tremendous fanfare, we can’t ignore its breadth across cloud, software, and hardware.\n\nLook no further than Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing segment, for instance. Azure’s revenue popped 29% last quarter. Thus, Microsoft is now encroaching on Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) turf via fledgling search and browser initiatives.\n\nNotably, MSFT stock also has 36 “buy” ratings against just one “hold,” with Wall Street remaining keen on Microsoft, as I am. This company has its hands in so many cookie jars (AI is just one example) that I expect substantial growth ahead. Buckle up for the ride!\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) The Uber logo is displayed on a smartphone on top of a map background.\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of software’s biggest recent success stories, Uber (NYSE:UBER) has surged to new all-time highs in recent weeks. Propelled by robust momentum and an impeccable balance sheet, Uber certainly looks like a juggernaut in the making. It’s no shock that Uber earns 35 resounding “buy” ratings among analysts against just one lone “hold” rating.\n\nNo doubt, Uber’s growth trajectory impresses mightily. The company’s earnings per share could leap from $1.15 in 2024 all the way to $6.61 in 2032, if growth remains on track. However, with 2024 earnings putting Uber’s forward price-to-earnings ratio above 53-times, I concur with that solitary “hold” rating. Despite turbocharged profit growth expected ahead, today’s rich valuation gives me reason to pause. Uber’s forward multiple will sink to around 9-times if everything goes perfectly based on 2032 income projections. But paying upfront for these earnings means investors are forced to assume some pretty significant risk.\n\nUnlike entrenched tech titans, Uber operates within the concentrated rideshare niche and is still working toward mainstream adoption. I believe waiting for a better entry point seems to be the smart play before biting on a stock trading at over 9-times potential 2032 earnings today. Long-term bulls may toss aside my caution and buy regardless, and that I think is not a bad idea if you want to hold for decades.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLooking back to March 2023 when I first touted CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), its blistering growth metrics were undoubtedly mouthwatering. But with its valuation now stretching beyond 85-times forward earnings and 20-times forward sales, I’m balking – even with CrowdStrike garnering 34 “buy” recommendations against just 2 “hold” ratings from Wall Street analysts.\n\nWithout question, cybersecurity industry tailwinds should continue to propel CrowdStrike to new heights over this coming decade. However, paying today’s extremely steep premium seems awfully hard to justify when even the most optimistic 2033 revenue projections still put CRWD stock at almost 3-times next year’s sales. Only the most eager bulls could try rationalizing buying at such current nosebleed levels.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike CrowdStrike, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to bake highly optimistic growth assumptions into its currently lofty valuation. Sure, Nvidia has knocked recent quarterly earnings reports out of the park. But looking ahead, risks definitely loom large, both from AI chipmaking rivals rapidly narrowing the technology gap along with uncertainty permeating the still-emerging and largely unprofitable AI landscape overall.\n\nI believe Wall Street largely overestimates Nvidia’s future prospects, while seriously discounting the competitive and industry headwinds that could plausibly dampen growth. Nvidia earns an overwhelmingly positive 31 “buy” ratings against three mere “hold” ratings. Analysts clearly envisage blue skies dominating ahead. I respectfully disagree with that upbeat prognosis, and suggest prospective investors wait for a better entry point before jumping aboard.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) falls into the same frothy camp. This company has posted stellar market-beating performance in previous quarters, and holds a leadership position in the cybersecurity space. However, PANW stock appears to be priced to sheer perfection. Especially compared to high-flying cybersecurity peer CrowdStrike, Palo Alto’s top-line growth metrics look rather pedestrian moving forward. Yet, PANW stock still trades at remarkably rich earnings multiples, even when looking at 2033 projections.\n\nWith 30 “buy” ratings against just 4 “hold” ratings, Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly endorse Palo Alto Networks. However, I believe waiting for an inevitable pullback should deliver much better risk-reward upside for investors not currently holding this stock. I’d personally replace these cybersecurity picks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) if it weren’t for my basing these picks purely using Wall Street ratings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell 3.6% at the close of trading in New York on Tuesday, the stock's steepest drop since August. The moves came after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker and lowered its price target for shares of the company on fears of slowing iPhone 15 sales in China.\n\n“We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables,” Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\n“The biggest takeaway from the latest checks is incrementally worse [iPhone 15] data points out of China, together with developed markets remaining soft,” he added.\n\nAccording to Long, the softness in iPhone sales is likely to continue even after Apple launches the iPhone 16 later this year, as the phone isn’t expected to have many major upgrades over the current model.\n\nApple’s iPhone revenue declined roughly $5 billion in 2023 versus 2022. Sales of the company’s Macs, iPads, and wearables were also off, as consumers felt pressure from rising inflation and interest rates. The PC industry was also stung as fewer consumers needed to purchase new systems after millions bought up laptops and desktops at the start of the pandemic.\n\nLong also called out Apple’s services business as a potential weak link for the company, saying that the segment faces a number of battles ahead including those related to its App Store practices. Apple is facing pressure to allow app developers to offer users a means of paying for apps via third-party payment options that would cut out Apple’s 30% App Store fee.

(John Keeble/Getty Images) (John Keeble via Getty Images)\n\nThe company’s deal to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser could also be under threat as the Department of Justice continues its antitrust case against the search giant. Apple is estimated to rake in billions on the deal, which is reported under the services business.\n\nApple’s service business, on the other hand, jumped from $78.1 billion in 2022 to $85.2 billion in 2023. Long, however, says that the segment will start to see growth slow in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We model ~10% and ~8% growth in services in FY24 and FY25, well below [the] prior growth estimate of ~20%. In 2024, we should get an initial determination on the Google TAC, and some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAt the same time, Apple is continuing to fight its patent battle with medical device maker Masimo over whether the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor infringes on Masimo’s patents related to the technology.\n\nApple initially pulled its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from store shelves ahead of Christmas after the International Trade Commission called for a ban on imports of the watches. But a federal appeals court ruled Apple could continue selling the watches while the dispute works its way through the court system.\n\nDespite those potential troubles, Apple has a major bright spot on the horizon: its Vision Pro headset. Apple is expected to host a launch event for the AR/VR headset sometime in February. And if the Vision Pro, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is a success, it could set up Apple as the go-to company for a new generation of computing devices.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The federal minimum wage in the US hasn’t budged from the hourly rate of $7.25 in over 14 years. But 22 states and 40 cities increased their own minimum wages to ring in the New Year.\n\nAs of Jan. 1, seven states (along with the District of Columbia) now have minimum wages of at least $15: Washington, Connecticut, Massachusetts,California, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland.\n\nAn additional six states have approved gradual increases to $15 an hour. Oregon, where the minimum wage is currently $14.20, adjusts its rate for inflation every year on July 1.\n\nVoters are increasingly approving ballot measures to raise the minimum wage in their own states.\n\nThanks to a voter referendum in November 2020, Florida’s $12 minimum wage will increase to $13 on Sept. 30 and will rise by $1 on the same date each year until 2026, when it reaches $15 an hour. Hawaii’s minimum wage schedule is similar, reaching $16 an hour in 2026 and $18 an hour effective in 2028.\n\nLater this year, voters in Ohio, Oklahoma, and Michigan may decide on $15 hourly wage proposals in their statewide elections.\n\nMeanwhile, California enacted industry-specific hourly wages in 2023: Fast food workers now earn a minimum wage of $20 an hour starting in April, while healthcare workers will make at least $25 an hour by 2026.\n\nAt the same time, 20 states are still at the standard $7.25 minimum wage rate — including Pennsylvania.\n\n\"It is quite an embarrassment for Pennsylvania to be the only state — we're an island among all the other states who surround us who over the past several years, each and every year, have increased their minimum wages,\" said the state’s Senate Democratic leader, Jay Costa. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) speaks at a press conference on raising the federal minimum wage outside the US Capitol Building May 4, 2023. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nSome major cities also have their own minimum wages separate from federal and state levels. New York City — along with nearby Long Island and Westchester County — has a $16 minimum wage, while Oregon’s Portland metro area is $15.45.\n\nAnd as of Jan. 1, dozens more cities and counties are seeing a rise in minimum wage, a majority of these cities located in California. Cupertino, the home base of Apple (AAPL), is raising its minimum wage by $0.55 to $17.75 an hour. San Diego’s new hourly minimum wage will be $16.85, while Sunnyvale’s will come in at $18.55.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutside of California, Denver’s new minimum wage will be $18.29 an hour, while Minneapolis’s will now be $15.57, both due to inflation adjustments. Boulder County’s increase is the highest among all cities and counties, with a $2.04 pay bump to $15.69 an hour.\n\nFinally, three cities in Washington — SeaTac, Seattle, and Tukwila — are all bumping their hourly pay as a result of inflation. Tukwila’s new minimum wage is the highest among the three at $20.29.\n\nAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and healthcare policy for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Shares of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) biggest Asian suppliers sank on Wednesday, tracking an overnight decline in the iPhone maker after Barclays downgraded the stock citing cooling demand for its flagship product.\n\nApple slid nearly 3.6% to a seven-week low on Tuesday after Barclays downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight, while also trimming the stock’s price target to $160 from $161. Tuesday's losses wiped out about $100 billion of market capitalization from the iPhone maker.\n\nBarclays analysts flagged increased headwinds for Apple’s future device sales, particularly the iPhone. Such a scenario bodes poorly for Asian suppliers, given that a bulk of Apple’s supply chain for its devices is geared heavily towards Asia.\n\nShares of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930)- which supply memory chips and displays to Apple- sank between 2% and 3%. Samsung SDI (KS:006400)- which supplies Apple with batteries- shed 2.9%.\n\nLG Display (KS:034220) and LG Chem Ltd (KS:051915)- which are also suppliers to the iPhone maker- shed 0.3% and 2.5%, respectively, while Posco International Corp (KS:047050) lost 0.8%.\n\nHon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) and TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM)- which are key semiconductor suppliers to Apple- lost 0.5% and 2% in Taiwan trade.\n\nIn China, AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK:2018)- which supplies acoustic components to Apple- fell 3.6%, while BYD (HK:1211) sank 0.4% in Hong Kong trade.\n\nBarclays said that after a lackluster sales performance by the iPhone 15, its successor was likely to follow suit, with the firm unlikely to incorporate any new technologies that could spur a substantial sales boost.\n\nApple’s sales in China declined for three quarters in 2023, with the decline being partially attributed to a ban on government employees from using Apple products. The firm is also facing increased competition in the country from new offerings from Huawei, which had in October launched a new flagship phone aimed directly at the iPhone.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarclays said that Apple is likely to see weaker sales in developed markets, while increased sales in emerging markets are unlikely to offset the decline. The firm's services unit is also expected to see laggard revenue growth in the coming year.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "title": "Can 'Magnificent Seven' continue dominating markets in 2024?",
        "content": "The high-flying 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech stocks that powered markets in 2023 seem poised to extend their leadership in 2024. According to FactSet data, six of the seven including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are projected to rise double-digits this year, with only a negative return seen for Tesla (TSLA).\n\nYahoo Finance's Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So let's stick with the Magnificent Seven here because we know they drove record market gains in 2023. And Wall Street, optimistic the tech giants can keep that momentum going in the new year. According to estimates compiled by FactSet, the Street is projecting the Magnificent Seven stocks will rise an average of 11% in the new year, with the exception of laggard Tesla.\n\nSo as you mentioned, Julia, this is sort of that time of year, you rethink your portfolio maybe a bit. You think you know what, do I stick with the winners, right? And certainly the Magnificent Seven winners in 2023. If you piled in 12 months ago, you're probably feeling pretty good and pretty smart right about now. And there were different reasons those stocks worked last year.\n\nYou could think about AI, certainly these were companies that put so much time and effort and money into that tech, and they began to integrate that tech across their product portfolios.\n\nAnother reason obviously, some investors piled in because they thought they were defensive, right? They saw they were relatively predictable strong moats, strong balance sheets. Warren Buffett likes some of them. He's a pretty smart guy. So now the question is, do you think do you stick with that trade as we head into the new year?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, most strategists are sticking with that trade, at least the individual analysts who cover these stocks, if we look at those price targets, except for Tesla, they're all on average looking for upside here. That said, they're all expecting less upside than we saw last year without exception. All of those Magnificent Seven stocks, if you calculate the change from the close on Friday, last Friday, to the price target, we're talking about a smaller gain than they saw in 2023, or in Tesla's case, a loss.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it is optimism, but it's more muted optimism going into this year. One of the folks who's a macro person, who looks at this is David Costner over at Goldman Sachs. He says the baseline is that mega-cap tech stocks will continue to outperform the remainder of the S&P 500, although it should be said, the forecast for the S&P overall, there's a big range, but most of them are also for modest gains in the index.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: There are some, you know, dedicated tech bulls, though, who are you people are being too conservative. And I think it comes down to where the AI. And they see these companies-- and this is the very bullish case. They see these companies continuing to invest. They're going to keep integrating that tech across their products, across their services, and they just are making a bet that use cases and monetization is going to keep ramping.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. A couple of individual things that I just quickly want to mention that's going on today. One of them is that Apple shares are trading lower. They got an a rating over from Barclays that is pushing the shares down.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Very rare downgrade to sell--\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yes, exactly.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: --the iPhone. But you don't see that very often.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Time for a breather, they say. So we're going to talk more about this later, but you could argue given the size of Apple as Apple goes--\n\nJOSH LIPTON: For sure.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: --the rest of tech, and then the rest of the market goes. So that's definitely weighing on things today. On the flip side, you've got Tesla, which is out with deliveries, we're going to talk more about that later as well. And so even though the forecast is for it to decline on the year, it had been higher earlier today.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Because they beat. They beat consensus.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Now off by 2/3.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: We'll keep watching that one.",

        "title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Reality is Starting to Set In",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a darling of the markets and a member of the “Magnificent Seven.” Yet, investors are starting to see the reality of the situation on 2024’s first trading day. I am neutral on AAPL stock, and I would send an urgent message to Apple’s perma-bulls: high-flying stocks generally need to correct or consolidate before the next leg up.\n\nApple is a world-famous manufacturer of smartphones and other tech gadgets. Apple is also known for various services, including streaming.\n\nWith a $2.88 trillion market capitalization, Apple is bigger than all other U.S. companies. This might sound bullish, but no company is unstoppable, and no stock can just keep going up without taking a break. This is even true for AAPL stock, which fell today in what might be a bad omen for 2024.\n\nApple Stock: This is What Exhaustion Looks Like\n\nIf you look up “exhaustion” in the dictionary, you might find a picture of Apple stock’s one-year price chart. I’m joking, of course, but the point is that investing in Apple right now involves serious downside risk.\n\nFrom a chart perspective, Apple hit major resistance at just below $200 in July and then again in December. In hindsight, AAPL stock really needed to take a breather after its relentless rally in 2023’s first half.\n\nFurthermore, after gaining around 52% last year, Apple stock appears to have more room below than above. That air pocket below could easily get filled now that Apple’s market cap is so elevated.\n\nValue-focused investors should be concerned, as Apple’s trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio was nearly 8x before today’s share-price drop. For comparison’s sake, the sector median P/S ratio is slightly above 3x.\n\nI chose to cite Apple’s P/S ratio because the company’s sales are a topic of discussion today – but more on that in a moment. First, I wanted to be fair and balanced and acknowledge one analyst’s bullish perspective on Apple.\n\nSoft iPhone Sales in China: Just a “Fictional Story”?\n\nAfter AAPL stock’s “magnificent” rally last year, it shouldn’t be too surprising that some analysts are bullish on the stock. Among the most vocal Apple optimists on Wall Street is a well-known analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s no secret that Apple’s iPhone sales haven’t been stellar in China. There, customers are loyal to China-based smartphone brands, especially Huawei.\n\nThe market largely overlooked this problem for Apple, and Ives doesn’t seem very concerned about it. The Wedbush analyst seems dismissive of what he calls the “growing noise and Huawei competition in China” and the “iPhone China demise narrative,” which Ives called a “great fictional story” cooked up by the bears.\n\nWith that in mind, Ives reiterated his Outperform rating on AAPL stock and published a Street-high $250 price target on the shares. Only time will tell whether Apple can manage to live up to Ives’ confident vision, as the company’s issues in China won’t just go away tomorrow or next week.\n\nApple Stock: A Bear Emerges\n\nIn stark contrast to Ives and many other Apple bulls, one analyst dared to issue a warning about the company today. It’s a rare event since analysts usually heap praise upon Apple.\n\nSpecifically, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst Tim Long downgraded AAPL stock from a Hold to a Sell rating and lowered his price target on the shares from $161 to $160. That’s not a huge price-target reduction, but the Sell rating is getting a lot of coverage in the financial media today.\n\nLong cited the “lackluster” performance of Apple’s iPhone 15, stating, “Our checks remain negative on volumes and mix for iPhone 15, and we see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling.” That’s a powerful warning, as Apple’s smartphones are the company’s bread and butter.\n\nDon’t expect Apple’s Services business to rescue the company, either. On that topic, Long warned, “We also believe 2024 will bring more Services risk to light.”\n\nMoreover – and here’s the part that I fully agree with – Long expressed concerns about Apple’s overextended valuation versus the company’s actual results. “The continued period of weak results coupled with multiple expansion is not sustainable,” Long cautioned.\n\nIs Apple Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, AAPL comes in as a Moderate Buy based on 23 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Apple stock price target is $203.04, implying 10.2% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell AAPL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Krish Sankar of TD Cowen, with an average return of 47.31% per rating and a 93% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider Apple Stock?\n\nI wouldn’t dare to short Apple shares, as the company is still a technology gadget juggernaut, and expensive stocks can always get more expensive. On the other hand, I’m not prepared to dismiss Apple’s China concerns like Ives seems to be doing.\n\nPlus, eager investors should take a long, hard look at Apple’s valuation while also heeding Long’s warnings. When all is said and done, Apple is still an important company with strong long-term growth prospects. However, much of Apple’s anticipated growth is probably already priced into AAPL stock, so I’m neutral on it and am not considering a share position now.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "What’s behind Apple’s $100 billion market-cap loss today? A major downgrade that has investors worried about slowing iPhone sales is the key culprit",
        "content": "After surging roughly 50% to a record high in 2023, a rare rating downgrade from Wall Street helped push Apple stock down 3.65% on Tuesday, shaving over $100 billion from the tech giant’s market cap.\n\nBarclays analyst Tim Long tagged Apple with an “underweight” rating due to weak iPhone demand Tuesday morning, arguing its shares could sink roughly 13% to $160 over the next 12 months.\n\nIt’s rare to see any analyst hit America’s highest-valued company with a negative rating. Apple is rated at hold or better by 40 out of 44 Wall Street forecasters, according to data provided to the Wall Street Journal by FactSet. But Long said that iPhone 15 sales have been “lackluster”—particularly in China, which has reportedly banned government officials from using Apple’s flagship product due to security concerns. He also expects sales of the iPhone 16, which is set to be released in September, to be weaker than expected. “We see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,” he wrote.\n\nWhile Barclays’ downgrade may have sparked Apple’s stock price drop Tuesday, there are several other factors putting the company under pressure. For one, after Apple shares jumped nearly 50% last year, investors might be reallocating some capital away from the company in the new year. “The new year brings tax-motivated postponed gain-taking and repositioning by portfolio managers,” Louis Navellier, founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, told Bloomberg Tuesday.\n\nApple’s decline also coincides with wider weakness in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. The index sank 1.6% on Tuesday, with investors digesting the potential impact of rising geopolitical tensions amid the Israel-Hamas war and Houthi rebel attacks on ships carrying freight in the Red Sea, a critical trade route. Surging oil prices and broken supply chains because of conflict in the Middle East could lead inflation to be stickier than previously anticipated, which might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high, weighing on growth-focused tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere have also been warning signs about waning iPhone demand for some time—and that’s critical given that iPhone sales made up nearly 50% of Apple’s total revenue in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nUBS analyst David Vogt, who holds a neutral rating and $190 price target for Apple, warned in a Monday note that iPhone 15 sales have been “soft” in many key regions lately, including China and India.\n\nVogt explained that U.S. iPhone sales to end customers (called sell-through) fell almost 13% from a year ago in November, while China sales were down 6% over the same period. This led Apple to lose 50 basis points of global smartphone market share year over year in November, and 320 basis points of smartphone market share in China over the same period. “New competition is a challenge,” Vogt said of the data.\n\nRegulatory challenges to Apple’s app store in the U.S. and EU are also weighing on investor sentiment. Apple’s $85 billion services business could face pressure due to a U.S. antitrust trial that revealed, among other things, Google pays tens of billions a year to maintain its standing as the default search engine on Apple’s devices.\n\n“In 2024…some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote Monday, noting that the U.S. court’s decision over Google’s payments to Apple will come later this year.\n\nAs Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told the Financial Times last week, investors may have been ignoring antitrust risks in recent years, but as a number of high-profile cases wind their way through the courts, antitrust is no longer just “noise in the background.”\n\n“I think investors should take it seriously,” he warned.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Senior AnalystMartin Yang is more bullish. Yang says that Apple is seeing a \"deceleration of Apple's share gain momentum in China and developed markets in recent quarters,\" but that ultimately that issue will correct itself.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, we're taking a look at Apple shares, still in negative territory this morning. Down more than 3%. This comes after Barclays downgraded the stock to underweight, and lowered its price target by $1. The bank's analyst Tim Long saying the current iPhone sales are lackluster, and there was a lack of bounce back in Macs, iPads, and wearables.\n\nOur next guests are keeping an eye on Apple's performance and how the company will continue to engage with customers in the US and abroad. Let's bring in Gil Luria, D.A. Davidson managing director, as well as Martin Yang, Oppenheimer senior analyst of Emerging Technologies and Services. A big welcome to you both here.\n\nSo it's worth noting that in this note, they talked most specifically about the iPhone 15's performance in China, and really signaled that as broader weakness potentially for the iPhone 16, and some of the other hardware sales. So, Gil, I want to start with you here because you are in that same sort of camp in terms of having a neutral rating, and you have $166 price target. What concerns you most about the reports coming out from Apple?\n\nStory continues\n\nGIL LURIA: Well, it's not necessarily reports from this holiday season. We're not going to actually know how many iPhones they sold until they tell us. All these checks are very, very partial. There's a lot of moving pieces. There's a week less of sales, but there's better supply chain. There's restrictions in China, but there's some aging hardware in the market as well. So we're not going to actually know.\n\nBut what we do know is that growth isn't going to be very fast-- not for the iPhone, or for any of the other hardware categories Apple is really just growing its services business at this point, and that's not enough to generate any more than just low single-digit revenue growth this year, after a pretty flat year last year. That's our concern is that unless they unclog their innovation rut, then it's going to be very hard for this company to accelerate growth on the hardware side.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Now, Martin, you have a $200 price target here. And you have an outperform rating, but when you look at the stock price reaction to this downgrade, do you think it's overblown, or do you think it's fairly justified?\n\nMARTIN YANG: In the near-term, it's probably justified. We're seeing really deceleration of Apple's share gaining momentum in China and in developed markets in recent quarters. But in the longer term, I think it will correct itself because we do see a very stable active install base that will help to maintain a very strong service revenue growth for the longer term for Apple.",

The S&P 500 ended last week within 1% of a record closing high reached in early 2022.\n\nHowever, equities came under pressure on Tuesday as U.S. Treasury yields climbed. The yield on 10-year notes ticked above 4.000% to a two-week high before easing to 3.95%.\n\nApple fell 4% after Barclays downgraded the tech giant to \"underweight\", citing weakening iPhone demand. Other megacap stocks, including Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Microsoft shed between 1.8% and 3%.\n\n\"The losses right now are in tech, which was the biggest winner last year. It's not shocking that they came down a little,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading.\n\n\"What we saw in December was kind of a sloppy rally where people seem to be wanting to put things on their books maybe or cover shorts. That rally lasted a little bit too long.\"\n\nThe S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq booked nine consecutive weekly gains on Friday - the longest weekly winning streak for the S&P 500 since January 2004, and the longest for the Dow and the Nasdaq since early 2019.\n\nThe Fed's December policy meeting minutes and a slew of labor market data are on the roster for this week as market participants look to ascertain the timing of potential rate cuts.\n\nWhile the Fed is widely seen holding rates at its January meeting, traders expect a near 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 1:54 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.21 points, or 0.08%, at 37,719.75, the S&P 500 was down 27.88 points, or 0.58%, at 4,741.95, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 250.64 points, or 1.67%, at 14,760.71.\n\nHealth stocks were among the best performing of the S&P 500 sectors, rising 1.7% to the index's highest level in a year. Energy was also a leading gainer, up 1.6%, despite crude slipping on concerns about the economic outlook.\n\nInformation technology led declines with a 2.8% drop.\n\nTesla traded flat despite saying it delivered a record number of electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating market estimates and meeting its 2023 target of 1.8 million vehicles.\n\nBoeing shed 3.2% after Goldman Sachs removed the aerospace company from its \"conviction list\".\n\nMeanwhile, Citigroup hit its highest level in 11 months, advancing 3.1% to $53, after Wells Fargo raised its price target for the bank to $70 from $60. Wells analyst Mike Mayo also said Citi was his top pick among large banks in 2024, and he expects the stock to double to $100+ over the next three years.\n\nCrypto-related stocks such as Marathon Digital Holdings and MicroStrategy gained as bitcoin pierced above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022 on optimism around the possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru and David French in New York; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Aurora Ellis)",

        "title": "Apple stock falls 3% as Barclays says iPhone weakness will persist",
        "content": "Apple stock (AAPL) took a hit on Tuesday after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker and lowered its price target on shares on fears of slowing iPhone 15 sales in China. Apple shares were off some 3% on the report.\n\n“We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables,” Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\n“The biggest takeaway from the latest checks is incrementally worse [iPhone 15] data points out of China, together with developed markets remaining soft,” he added.\n\nAccording to Long, the softness in iPhone sales is likely to continue even after Apple launches the iPhone 16 later this year, as the phone isn’t expected to have many major upgrades over the current model.\n\nApple’s iPhone revenue declined roughly $5 billion in 2023 versus 2022. Sales of the company’s Macs, iPads, and wearables were also off, as consumers felt pressure from rising inflation and interest rates. The PC industry was also stung as fewer consumers needed to purchase new systems after millions bought up laptops and desktops at the start of the pandemic.\n\nLong also called out Apple’s services business as a potential weak link for the company, saying that the segment faces a number of battles ahead including those related to its App Store practices. Apple is facing pressure to allow app developers to offer users a means of paying for apps via third-party payment options that would cut out Apple’s 30% App Store fee. LONDON, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 11: A iPhone 15 is advertised at the Apple Store Brompton Road in Knightsbridge on December 11, 2023 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) (John Keeble via Getty Images)\n\nThe company’s deal to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser could also be under threat as the Department of Justice continues its antitrust case against the search giant. Apple is estimated to rake in billions on the deal, which is reported under the services business.\n\nApple’s service business, on the other hand, jumped from $78.1 billion in 2022 to $85.2 billion in 2023. Long, however, says that the segment will start to see growth slow in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We model ~10% and ~8% growth in services in FY24 and FY25, well below [the] prior growth estimate of ~20%. In 2024, we should get an initial determination on the Google TAC, and some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAt the same time, Apple is continuing to fight its patent battle with medical device maker Masimo over whether the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor infringes on Masimo’s patents related to the technology.\n\nApple initially pulled its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from store shelves ahead of Christmas after the International Trade Commission called for a ban on imports of the watches. But a federal appeals court ruled Apple could continue selling the watches while the dispute works its way through the court system.\n\nDespite those potential troubles, Apple has a major bright spot on the horizon: its Vision Pro headset. Apple is expected to host a launch event for the AR/VR headset sometime in February. And if the Vision Pro, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is a success, it could set up Apple as the go-to company for a new generation of computing devices.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures saw little movement during Tuesday's overnight trading, following the NASDAQ Composite's most severe declines since October.\n\nBy 6:30 pm ET (11:30 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures and S&P 500 Futures remained little changed while Nasdaq 100 Futures ticked 0.1% higher.\n\nBloomin Brands Inc (NASDAQ:BLMN), the company behind Outback Steakhouse, experienced a more than 3% rise after announcing the addition of two new members to its board. This move was in line with an agreement the company made with activist investor, Starboard Value.\n\nThe commencement of the new year experienced a downturn in stocks, with the S&P 500 falling 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average merely edging up by less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite recorded a drop of more than 1.6%, marking its worst day since October. This decline was largely due to a slump in major technology stocks and a near 4% decline in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), following a downgrade by Barclays (LON:BARC).\n\nCompanies that are poised to benefit from artificial intelligence, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), experienced drops of 2.7% and 6% respectively. Meanwhile, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), both leaders in chatbot technology, lost over 1%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fell by 3.4%, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) saw a 4.9% decrease.\n\nChris Verrone from Strategas noted on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday that the burden of proof is on the bears as we start the year. He pointed out that short-term corrections are not unusual in a market that's coming off of fresh highs and entering primary season. He also noted that the longer-term setup looks positive on a six- to twelve-month horizon.\n\nThe market is recovering from a remarkable year that witnessed all the major averages rebounding from a devastating 2022. The S&P 500 surged by over 24%, marking its longest weekly winning streak since 2004, while the Nasdaq jumped 43% for its best year since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shift back into risk assets was driven by easing inflation and a drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, which finished the year below 3.9% after reaching 5% in October. The end of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive hiking campaign and anticipation of rate cuts in 2024, along with increased hopes for a soft landing, has also boosted market sentiment in recent weeks.\n\nThe minutes from the Fed's December policy meeting, due out Wednesday, and comments from Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, could provide additional insight into the rate path ahead before the central bank meets later this month. The job openings report for November and December's ISM manufacturing data are also set for release later in the session.\n\nOn the bond markets, United States 10-Year rates were at 3.947%.\n\nUpgrade your decision-making with InvestingPro+!

The S&P 500 ended last week within 1% of a record closing high reached in early 2022.\n\nHowever, equities came under pressure on Tuesday as U.S. Treasury yields climbed. The yield on 10-year notes ticked above 4.000% to a two-week high before easing to 3.929%.\n\nApple fell 2.7% after Barclays downgraded the tech giant to \"underweight\", citing weakening iPhone demand. Other megacap stocks including Nvidia and Microsoft shed 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively.\n\n\"The losses right now are in tech, which was the biggest winner last year. It's not shocking that they came down a little,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading.\n\n\"What we saw in December was kind of a sloppy rally where people seem to be wanting to put things on their books maybe or cover shorts. That rally lasted a little bit too long.\"\n\nThe S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq booked nine consecutive weekly gains on Friday - the longest weekly winning streak for the S&P 500 since January 2004, and the longest for the Dow and the Nasdaq since early 2019.\n\nThe Fed's December policy meeting minutes and a slew of labor market data are on the roster for this week as market participants look to ascertain the timing of potential rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the Fed is widely seen holding rates at its January meeting, traders expect a near 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nAt 11:38 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 13.25 points, or 0.04%, at 37,676.29, the S&P 500 was down 26.72 points, or 0.56%, at 4,743.11, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 203.91 points, or 1.36%, at 14,807.44.\n\nHealth stocks outperformed the 10 other S&P 500 sectors, rising 1.4%, while information technology led declines with a 2.3% drop.\n\nTesla inched up 0.8% as it delivered a record number of electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating market estimates and meeting its 2023 target of 1.8 million vehicles.\n\nBoeing shed 2.6% after Goldman Sachs removed the aerospace company from its \"conviction list\".\n\nCrypto-related stocks such as Marathon Digital Holdings and MicroStrategy gained as bitcoin stormed above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022 on optimism around the possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and 1.07-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 17 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 59 new highs and 35 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "content": "Since its debut in 2010, the iPad has regularly received annual updates and enhancements. That streak came to an end in 2023, however.\n\nFor the first time since it introduced its tablet, Apple did not roll out a new model last year. The last time the company updated the line was in October 2022.\n\nThat drought is expected to end later this year, with the rumor mill suggesting a refresh on the entire product line, from entry-level iPads to a new flagship iPad Pro, which is expected to receive several new features, ranging from a better screen to a new keyboard attachment.\n\nThe new iPads could be introduced as early as March.\n\nPart of the reason for the interruption in new iPads, per Bloomberg, was Apple’s desire to make it easier for consumers to differentiate between models. The wide variety of models has resulted in a sales slowdown for the iPad. In fiscal 2023, sales of the tablet were down 3% compared to fiscal 2022. The year before, they saw an 8% decline.\n\nThe pause in new iPads also comes as Apple is working to add touch screens to its Mac computers, a decision that cofounder Steve Jobs once rejected and one the company previously worried could cannibalize iPad sales.\n\nThe company is also facing issues with its successful Apple Watch line, which is in the midst of a legal battle over a patent infringement battle with Masimo. An import ban went into effect late last year but was quickly paused by an appeals court.\n\nApple could use some good news. On the first day of trading in 2024, the company’s stock was down more than 3% in late morning trading. That followed a downgrade from Barclays, which cited a slowdown in iPhone sales, particularly in China. The drop wiped out over $100 billion of Apple’s market value.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The S&P 500 ended last week within 1% of a record closing high reached on Jan. 3, 2022.\n\nHowever, equities came under pressure on Tuesday as the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, ticked above 4.0000% to a two-week high, before easing to 3.9388%.\n\nMegacap stocks including Nvidia and Microsoft shed 3.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Apple fell 3.3% after Barclays downgraded the tech giant to \"underweight\", citing weaker iPhone demand.\n\n\"It's day one after a tremendous run. When you think about what happened from the October lows to now, I would expect the first three months of this year to be tough and this week to be somewhat exemplary of that, with people taking profits, realigning portfolios,\" said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.\n\n\"It's going to be about interest rates in these first few days of the year.\"\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, touched a near two-week high at 14.23 points.\n\nAt 9:45 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 70.22 points, or 0.19%, at 37,619.32, the S&P 500 was down 34.90 points, or 0.73%, at 4,734.93, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 224.07 points, or 1.49%, at 14,787.29.\n\nStory continues\n\nHealth stocks outperformed the 10 other S&P 500 sectors, rising 1%, while information technology led declines with a 2.5% drop.\n\nAfter optimism around artificial intelligence and stabilizing interest rates powered U.S. stocks in 2023, more inflation data and looming presidential elections will put further market gains to the test.\n\nWeekly jobless claims, monthly private and non-farm payrolls data as well as services sector data are on the roster for the week. On Tuesday, the S&P Global's final reading of U.S. manufacturing activity for December came in at 47.9, compared with earlier estimates of 48.2.\n\nMarket participants are also awaiting the Fed's December policy meeting minutes, due on Wednesday, to ascertain the timing of potential rate cuts.\n\nWhile the Fed is widely seen holding rates at its January meeting, traders expect a near 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nCompanies linked to cryptocurrencies gained as bitcoin stormed above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022, on optimism around the possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings and MicroStrategy jumped 8.9% and 13%.\n\nBoeing shed 1.4% after Goldman Sachs removed the aerospace company from its \"conviction list\".\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.81-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 15 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Biggest Bets in 2024: 57.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's $367.5 Billion Stock Portfolio Is Held in Just 2 Stocks",
        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett's financial track record is legendary. The Omaha, Nebraska, native has led his company to market-crushing success through multiple decades and informed and inspired millions of investors around the world.\n\nStrikingly, the famous moneyman has delivered incredible returns while largely avoiding the time-honored practice of portfolio diversification. Buffett does advocate diverse holdings for less-experienced investors, calling it \"protection against ignorance.\" But for investors who know what they are doing, he says it makes little sense. For this experienced investor, roughly 57.4% of Berkshire's $367.5 billion portfolio is concentrated in just two stocks.\n\nRead on as two Motley Fool contributors explain why Buffett has placed huge bets on a duo of industry-leading companies.\n\nApple is an excellent innovator\n\nParkev Tatevosian: Surprisingly, the Oracle of Omaha has directed that 47.9% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio be invested in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. I say surprisingly not because Apple is not worth investment, but because it's unusual to see even professional investors with such a concentrated portfolio. Nevertheless, I can understand why Warren Buffett likes Apple. It is one of the most innovative businesses worldwide, has a proven track record, and sells at a reasonable valuation.\n\nApple's reputation as a trusted brand among consumers helps it retain those customers longer and encourages them to pay a premium for its products and services. That brand loyalty helped Apple grow revenue from $183 billion in 2014 to $383 billion in 2023. When it comes time to upgrade an Apple device, people often stick with the brand, especially because of the ecosystem Apple has built around it. For example, the Apple Watch integrates well with Apple's iPhone and is improved with services from Apple's App Store. If you have any of Apple's products, that ecosystem increases the inconvenience of switching to a rival brand.\n\nStory continues AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe ability to charge a premium has proven to be profitable for Apple. The company's operating income rose from $53 billion to $114 billion in the abovementioned years.\n\nAnd yet, throughout Berkshire's ownership of Apple stock where the stock price is up roughly 600%, the stock has never gotten too expensive to buy (when measured by the price-to-earnings ratio), giving Berkshire little reason to exit or dilute its investment in Apple stock. Perhaps those reading this article may consider following suit.\n\nOne of Buffett's greatest success stories\n\nKeith Noonan: Today, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) stands as Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest stock holding and accounts for roughly 9.5% of the company's portfolio. That represents an incredible vote of confidence from the Oracle of Omaha. But the stock actually started as a massive loser for Buffett.\n\nAfter first purchasing BofA shares in 2007, Berkshire completely exited its position in the stock in the fourth quarter of 2010. The bank's earnings saw weak recovery on the heels of the Great Recession, and it faced ongoing pressures due to the housing crash, subprime mortgage crisis, and other macroeconomic risks.\n\nBuffett contacted Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan directly in 2011 with a surprising proposal to provide the struggling financial giant with investment capital. Ultimately, Berkshire wound up buying $5 billion worth of the bank's preferred stock.\n\nBuffett's company also received warrants that would allow it to purchase 700 million shares of the bank's common stock at a price of $7.14 per share. It would up being an all-time great deal for Buffett.\n\nIn June 2017, BofA stock had seen a dramatic recovery and was trading above $24 per share. Berkshire announced that it would be exercising its warrants -- a move that immediately scored a $12 billion paper profit for the investment conglomerate. The announcement spurred even more short-term gains for the stock, and shares continued to climb in subsequent years -- but the deal has been even sweeter than a quick look at Bank of America's stock performance would suggest. BAC Dividend Chart\n\nWith the benefit of improving financial performance, BofA delivered impressive dividend growth since Buffett moved to exercise those stock warrants. The company currently pays an annual dividend of $0.96 per share -- working out to a 13.4% yield on those 700 million shares that Berkshire purchased at a share price of just $7.14.\n\nBerkshire also purchased more of the bank's stock since its big warrant move and now owns roughly 1.03 billion shares of BofA stock. With its massive investment position, Buffett's company is generating almost $1 billion in annual dividend income just for sitting on its Bank of America stock. With the bank likely to deliver another payout increase next summer, Berkshire's annual dividend income from the stock will almost certainly cross the $1 billion threshold.\n\nDespite a rocky start, Bank of America stock wound up being a massive winner for Buffett. There's a very good chance the financial services giant will remain Berkshire's second-largest holding in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Apple downgraded, Booking upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop Upgrades:\n\nWells Fargo upgraded Booking Holdings (BKNG) and Expedia (EXPE) to Equal Weight from Underweight with price targets of $3,459 and $159, up from $2,402 and $91, respectively. The firm believes gross booking estimates for the company are achievable and says its competitive intensity thesis did not play out in 2023. Stephens upgraded American Express (AXP) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $193, up from $148. With management having already implicitly guided to a 2024 guidance miss on a December webcast, investors are now focused on 2025 estimates, when American Express can return to its historical revenue and earnings growth targets year-over-year, the firm tells investors in a research note. Oppenheimer upgraded Moderna (MRNA) to Outperform from Perform with a $142 price target. The firm sees \"increasing visibility\" on the company's COVID-19 vaccine sales and says catalysts in 2024 and 2025 give it reason to believe Moderna could be a five-product commercial company by 2026. Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded Sprout Social(SPT) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $74, up from $48. The firm expects Sprout's story to become much cleaner in 2024, which makes its current valuation attractive. BofA upgraded Doximity (DOCS) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $29, up from $21. The firm thinks earnings expectations have been appropriately reset and that pharma manufacturer budgets could begin to improve over the next year as pressure from higher interest rates begins to ease.\n\nTop Downgrades:\n\nBarclays downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $160, down from $161. The firm expects \"reversion\" in 2024 after a year when most quarters were missed and the stock outperformed  Deutsche Bank downgraded Estee Lauder(EL) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $146. The firm continues to see long-term upside should Hainan and Korea inventories clear as anticipated by April 1, but also sees near-term downside risk should Estee's China inventory recovery progress encounter delays and/or U.S. market conditions continue to slow. Evercore ISI downgraded Southwest (LUV) to In Line from Outperform with a $35 price target. While fuel prices ended on a more manageable note despite geopolitical risks, Evercore is taking the over on ex-fuel unit costs and the under on capacity growth into 2024. Piper Sandler downgraded Unity (U) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $35, up from $20. The stock rose 35% in one month and 43% in 2023, which leaves \"little margin for error,\" the firm says. Piper Sandler also downgraded BlackLine (BL) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $60, up from $53. DA Davidson downgraded Hasbro (HAS) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $53, down from $60. While citing valuation for the downgrade with the shares up 20% in two months, the firm also cut its below-consensus estimates.\n\nTop Initiations:\n\nWilliam Blair initiated coverage of UiPath (PATH) with an Outperform rating. The firm believes UiPath's leadership position in a large market for automation technology should help the company deliver durable growth and expanding margins over the next few years. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Rollins (ROL) with a Buy rating and $49 price target. The firm believes Rollins is a \"differentiated and leading provider of pest control services leveraged to strong route density, a unique multi-brand strategy that facilitates market share gains, and attractive business model characteristics including recurring revenues, defensiveness and operating leverage.\" Fox Advisors initiated coverage of Instacart (CART) with an Outperform rating and $30 price target.",

        "content": "By Aditya Soni and Medha Singh\n\n(Reuters) -Apple on Tuesday fell nearly 3% to a seven-week low after Barclays downgraded the shares of the world's most valuable firm on concerns demand for its devices from the iPhone to Mac will remain weak in 2024.\n\nBarclays is the second brokerage to have the equivalent of a \"sell\" rating on the stock, which now has its most number of bearish recommendations in at least two years, per LSEG data.\n\nThe stock accounts for a hefty 7% of the S&P 500's market weight - the broader index was dragged 0.4% lower on Tuesday. Apple rose nearly 50% in 2023, hitting a record high in mid-December in a year when Big Tech led the markets.\n\nApple has been grappling with a demand slowdown since early last year and has forecast holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates. Its performance in China has also been a worry after the revival of local rival Huawei.\n\n\"The iPhone 15 has been lackluster and we believe iPhone 16 should be the same,\" Barclays analyst Tim Long said in a client note, pointing to the China weakness as well as subdued demand in developed markets.\n\nThe brokerage also warned risks were mounting for Apple's services business, which has come under the scanner in countries including the United States over app store practices.\n\nLong is rated four out of five stars for his recommendation accuracy on Apple, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe business has often outpaced growth in Apple's hardware segment in recent years and now accounts for nearly a quarter of the company's total revenue.\n\nThe shares drop on Tuesday was set to erase about $90 billion from Apple's market capitalization.\n\nBarclays downgraded the stock to \"underweight\" from \"neutral\" and trimmed its 12-month price target by $1 to $160. Before Tuesday, Itau BBA's \"sell\" was the only bearish rating on Apple since July 2022.\n\nAnalysts, on average, rate the iPhone maker \"buy\" with a median price target of $200. The company trades at about 28.7 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, much higher than the S&P 500's 19.8.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Krishna Chandra Eluri)",

The S&P 500 ended last week within 1% of its record closing high reached on Jan. 3, 2022.\n\nHowever, U.S. stock futures came under pressure on Tuesday as the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, ticked above 4.0000% to a two-week high, before easing to 3.9707%.\n\nMegacap stocks including Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet shed more than 1% each in premarket trading. Apple fell 2.4% after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker's stock to \"underweight\".\n\n\"It's day one after a tremendous run. When you think about what happened from the October lows to now, I would expect the first three months of this year to be tough and this week to be somewhat exemplary of that, with people taking profits, realigning portfolios,\" said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.\n\n\"It's going to be about interest rates in these first few days of the year.\"\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, touched a near two-week high at 14.11 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 8:26 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 227 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 39.25 points, or 0.81%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 196.75 points, or 1.16%.\n\nFollowing a blockbuster 2023, boosted by optimism around artificial intelligence and stabilizing interest rates, more inflation data and looming presidential elections will put further market gains to the test.\n\nS&P Global's final reading of U.S. manufacturing activity for December is due at 9:45 a.m. ET. Weekly jobless claims, monthly private and non-farm payrolls data as well as services sector data are on the roster for the week.\n\nMarket participants are also awaiting the Fed's December policy meeting minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday, to ascertain the timing of the rate cuts.\n\nWhile the Fed is widely seen holding interest rates at its January meeting, traders expect a 70% chance of a 25-basis point rate in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nCompanies linked to cryptocurrencies gained premarket as bitcoin stormed above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022, on optimism around the possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.\n\nCoinbase Global and MicroStrategy jumped 2.8% and 7%.\n\nEnergy majors such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron edged higher, tracking a 2% jump in crude prices after a naval clash in the Red Sea raised the chances of Middle East supply disruptions.\n\nBoeing shed 1.4% after Goldman Sachs removed the aerospace company from its \"conviction list\".\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",

        "content": "Wall Street closed out 2023 on fire, moving higher for the final nine trading weeks of the year. But there are still stocks sinking in the rising tide. I thought my  three stocks to avoid for last week -- Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), Steelcase (NYSE: SCS), and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) -- were going to lose to the market. They rose 3%, slipped 3%, and ascended 5%, respectively, for an average gain of 1.7% for the week.\n\nThe  S&P 500 moved 0.3% higher, so I fell short. I have still been right in 70 of the past 114 weeks, or 61% of the time.\n\nNow is as good a time as any to end this weekly column. I don't mind letting my inner pessimist out -- and I will continue to call overpriced stocks out -- but making short-term weekly market calls has never been a part of my long-term investment strategy. I'm going to close by stretching my timeline. Forget about the week ahead. Let's look at stocks that can come undone over the course of the new year. I see Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Cal-Maine Foods(NASDAQ: CALM), and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) losing to the market in 2024. Let's go over my concerns with three very different investments.\n\n1. Apple\n\nHistory says you shouldn't bet against Apple in 2024. Going all the way back to 2012, Apple has one good fiscal year of double-digit revenue growth, followed up by back-to-back years of duds with negative or single-digit top-line gains.\n\nFiscal 2012 revenue growth: 45% 2013: 9% 2014: 7% 2015: 28% 2016: (8%) 2017: 6% 2018: 16% 2029: (2%) 2020: 6% 2021: 33% 2022: 8% 2023: (3%)\n\nApple refreshes its flagship iPhone every year, but it seems as if a major update happens every three years. Is the triennial boost a thing of the past? Maybe not. Analysts see Apple's revenue rising less than 4% this fiscal year, accelerating to a mere 6% in fiscal 2025. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nI'm all in with the Apple ecosystem of consumer tech products. I even have a small position in the stock. I just don't know if the consumer tech giant can continue to be the country's most valuable company by market cap -- at $3 trillion -- when we're at the midpoint of four unimpressive years of growth at Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's a reasonable argument to be made that Apple is an all-weather stock. It beats the market when equities are weak as a flight to quality. It's also a winner when the economy's going well and folks don't mind paying a premium for Apple products. However, with the stock soaring 49% in 2023 even as revenue and net income took a small step back, it's hard to justify paying more than 30 times trailing earnings for a slow-growing Apple.\n\n2. Cal-Maine Foods\n\nI do have one short-term call in me, but I expect it to linger for all of 2024. There aren't a lot of earnings reports to go through in the first week of 2024, but Cal-Maine is one of them, and things could go poorly for its shareholders. The egg producer was rolling a year ago, when a supply shortage sent prices, margin, and profitability higher. But you're not paying $10 for a dozen eggs now, and that's bad news for Cal-Maine investors.\n\nCal-Maine will report financial results of its fiscal second quarter on Wednesday afternoon. Analysts see a 34% year-over-year revenue decline on a brutal 83% plunge in earnings per share. Don't let the chunky trailing yield trick you, either. Cal-Maine pays a variable dividend, and the payouts should drop along with its sliding profitability. In short, this egg producer may not be what it's cracked up to be.\n\n3. Tesla\n\nCan you believe Apple won't be the most controversial bearish pick on this list? As a Tesla owner for three years, I have nothing but love for the car. However, it's hard to feel confident about the stock in 2024 after seeing it more than double in 2023 despite a few problematic developments.\n\nRevenue growth decelerated sharply in 2023. Profitability has declined, as the need to slash prices to move units has crushed margin. Elon Musk's distractions are problematic, and I'm sure even he would concede that he can be a bit polarizing. Tesla owners remain largely satisfied, but will that continue to be the case in 2024, when non-Tesla cars begin pulling into Supercharger bays and making waits longer? Just wait until they see what happened to resale values over the past year.\n\nThe stock market is always on the move. If you're looking for safe stocks, you aren't likely to find them in Apple, Cal-Maine Foods, and Tesla Motors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Better Growth Stock in 2024: Amazon vs. Apple",
        "content": "The new year is here, and there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the next 12 months. 2023 had a tricky start, coming out of a year where the Nasdaq Composite had plunged 33% amid macroeconomic headwinds. However, the situation is much more positive as we begin 2024.\n\nIn 2023, the Nasdaq Composite rose 43%, fueled by easing inflation and excitement over burgeoning sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI). The market will probably continue trending up in the coming months, with now an excellent time to consider investing in companies set up to flourish this year and beyond.\n\nAs titans of their respective industries, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive growth stocks with exciting developments in 2024. Amazon has posted multiple quarters of surging growth in its retail business, while Apple will launch its highly anticipated virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset.\n\nSo let's look at whether Amazon or Apple is the better growth stock in 2024.\n\nAmazon: Delivering a comeback\n\nAmazon has delivered an impressive comeback over the past 12 months after suffering steep declines in its e-commerce business in 2022.\n\nIn its latest quarter, the third quarter of 2023, the company posted 13% year-over-year revenue growth, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, its North American segment exceeded $4 billion in operating income, significantly improving on the $412 million in losses it reported in the year-ago period.\n\nThe tech giant owes much of its growth over the past year to various cost-cutting moves, such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, shuttering unprofitable programs such as Amazon Care, and laying off thousands of people. The restructuring saw Amazon's free cash flow rise 427% over the past year to $17 billion.\n\nAs a result, the company is starting 2024 in excellent form. With lower expenses, it has the funds to fuel its R&D as it continues to expand in AI and overcome potential headwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is leading two crucial markets with its e-commerce and cloud computing services, with its business likely to deliver significant gains for years.\n\nApple: Temporary challenges\n\nApple didn't have it as easy as Amazon in 2023, as an economic downturn led to consumer pullback and repeated declines in its product sales.\n\nFor the fiscal year, the company's revenue fell 3% year over year after its highest earnings segment, the iPhone, saw revenue tumble 2% alongside dips in Mac, iPad, and wearable sales.\n\nHowever, there's reason to believe the current challenges are only temporary, meaning it's still worth investing in Apple. The company has built immense brand loyalty with its users, which resulted in the third largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S. despite offering a significantly fewer products compared to industry leaders Amazon and Walmart.\n\nThe popularity of Apple's products bodes well for its soon-to-be-launched Vision Pro, its first VR/AR headset, which will hit the shelves in 2024. Data from Fortune Business Insights shows the VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has a reputation for entering new markets and quickly rising to dominance, attracting consumers with its focus on quality, connectivity between its devices, and easy-to-use design language.\n\nApple hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Alongside a highly lucrative digital services business, the company remains an attractive growth stock for the new year.\n\nIs Amazon or Apple the better growth stock in 2024?\n\nAmazon and Apple dominate their respective industries and are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon. They have long histories of delivering consistent and significant gains, making them some of the best growth stocks out there. However, just because a company is leading an industry, that doesn't necessarily mean it's trading at the right price. AAPL PS Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart compares both companies' price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, with Amazon's lower figure suggesting its shares are currently the better value. P/S is calculated by dividing a company's total market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. As a result, Amazon's solid performance and financial growth have made it the better growth stock and set it up to be an excellent investment for 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "7 Megatrend Stocks to Buy for a Mighty Start to 2024",
        "content": "2024 promises to be a lucrative year in the stock market for many reasons. First of all, the Federal Reserve is on track to begin easing off in its efforts to cool an overheated economy. Interest rates are set to decrease with multiple projected cuts on the horizon.\n\nBeyond that though, the world continues to evolve at a rapid pace with multiple megatrends promising to galvanize strong growth. Perhaps none is more salient and influential than artificial intelligence. However there are many other trends to consider including sustainability, mobility, demographics, geopolitics and more. The biggest trends, the so-called megatrends, are particularly worth paying attention to.\n\nJoby Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA recent article in Forbes demonstrates why investors should be inherently interested in Joby Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) and its stock. The article paints a picture of an airline passenger who has just disembarked from a Hypersonic flight taking 2 hours from New York to London. That passenger then jumps into an urban air mobility drone, avoiding rush hour traffic, and arrives home in 20 minutes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUrban air mobility has emerged as one of the megatrends to pay attention to in 2023. Firms including Joby Aviation are developing electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) at a rapid pace. These firms have established strong relationships with airline companies, Joby with Delta (NYSE:DAL), that promise to revolutionize commercial flight.\n\nThe company undertook exhibition flights in New York City in November. The company expects to drastically decrease the time required to and from major airports in the area. For example, it anticipates that a flight to JFK from the surrounding boroughs will decline from 1 hour to 7 minutes. Joby Aviation continues to demonstrate the volume potential of its operations at airports. Joby recently demonstrated that it would be possible to operate 120 flights per hour in and out of busy airports.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Is another stock to consider that leverages the drastic changes occurring across the field of mobility. Electric vehicles continue to displace internal combustion engine vehicles although their growth has not been linear. I am, of course, referring to the recent collapse in lithium prices and EV sales.\n\nIn short, the electrification of vehicles is not going to stop. EV adoption is still relatively early overall but investors should rest assured the industry is not dying. Lithium did however face a steep price correction in 2023 that saw prices decline by 80%. However with every decline there is always a chance of rebound. Current expectations are that the rebound in lithium prices will begin either in 2024 or perhaps 2025.\n\nThat coincides quite well with Lithium Americas and its future production plans. The company owns the rights to Thacker Pass which is the largest lithium deposit in the Western hemisphere. Lithium Americas commenced construction in June of this year and anticipates lithium mining operations to start sometime in 2026. It isn’t hyperbolic to suggest that investing in Lithium Americas could produce 10x returns.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could pop up on any megatrend stock list for a number of reasons. The company is intimately connected with all things technological being that it is the leading producer of the most in-demand chips. Primarily though, Nvidia promises to provide a strong start to 2024 because of artificial intelligence.\n\nOf course, artificial intelligence is a megatrend that has taken off in 2023. Its rapid emergence has turned Nvidia into an even more important company. As strong as Nvidia’s performance has been in 2023, 2024 appears to be just as strong. The analysts covering Nvidia’s shares anticipate that prices could rise by 50% again, if not more.\n\nNvidia has cornered the market for AI chips and demand for its h100 chips has been staggering. That said, the company is expected to launch its updated h200 chips in 2024 that promise to further consolidate its lead over the AI field.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has to be the other stock to consider in relation to the artificial intelligence megatrend. While the company continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia, it has emerged as a legitimate competitor.\n\nBack in mid-November the company announced an event to introduce its MI300 GPU accelerator. Then, weeks later, in early December the company released the new chips which will be available in 2024. The news has sent AMD shares from just below $100 to nearly $150 as I write this.\n\nIt has become clear that major companies are very interested in AMD’s chips for their application to artificial intelligence. Major purchasers including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have noted that they are willing to switch from Nvidia’s h100 chips to AMD’s mi300 chips once they are available. The news is a clear indication that major tech firms believe in AMD and are also frustrated with Nvidia for its pricing. Overall though, it’s a strong indication that AMD is going to remain as a potent challenger in the AI conversation.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another important tech company that touches on many of the megatrends of the near future. The stock is a wise choice for many reasons including its stability and dividend as well as its relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nFor the purposes of this conversation though, I’ll be talking about Qualcomm in relation to its 5G business. 5G is one of the mega trends that has emerged over the past few years. It promises to rapidly increase the speed of communication and the degree of connectivity. The push toward greater and greater connectivity is not going to slow and it is estimated that $20,000 satellites will be launched this decade in order to facilitate that increased connectivity.\n\nQualcomm notes that 5G is imperative for the Continue development of the digital economy. In fact, the company believes that the overall value associated with 5G will exceed $13 trillion by 2035.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) Has emerged as the company that is most closely associated with the development of quantum computing. Quantum computing is a nascent technology that promises to fundamentally change computing overall. The field leverages quantum mechanics to solve problems that are too complex for current classical computers to solve.\n\nQuantum computing is an incredibly complex field and those who would like to learn more about it should do so through this link.\n\nThe important thing to understand for the layman investor like myself is that IBM is the leader in quantum computing. Thus, if any company is best positioned to take advantage of this megatrend, IBM is it.\n\nIBM’s industry-best qubit count is expected to more than quadruple by 2025. The company is developing quantum computing hardware as well as software including the cloud-based quantum computing services. If quantum computing lives up to its billing then IBM can grow rapidly. For now, current investors can get a dividend that yields more than 4% making IBM shares attractive for income investors and those looking for future growth.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) often enters discussions that relate to e-commerce and fintech stocks. It’s probably the clearest example of a company that is showing strong results in both regards. The company has emerged as the dominant force in Latin American e-commerce and created a strong, rapidly growing payments platform in the process.\n\nMercadoLibre’s results in that regard are incredibly impressive. During the third quarter, revenues increased by more than 69%, reaching $3.8 billion. Meanwhile, gross payment volume grew by 121% to $47.3 billion. And while Mercado Libre deserves recognition for those results, there are other megatrends that I want to focus on.\n\nInstead, it is the megatrend of emerging markets. Economists continue to note that emerging markets have vast untapped potential. World superpowers including the United States and China face significant problems which has led investors to look at emerging markets with a greater focus. Thus, firms like MercadoLibre are well positioned due to their exposure to the emerging market trend as well as those in fintech and commerce.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Expect big things for 2024 as global semiconductor trends accelerate. Analysts forecast that, broadly, 2024 will mark a record year for revenue while the industry prepares to double within the next decade, generating a trillion dollars in revenue between now and then.\n\nThat means, of course, that you don’t have to be the Warren Buffett of semiconductor stocks to ride the wave upward. If you find reliable, well-known, stable semiconductor stocks and hold them for the long haul, you’ll likely do just fine. But there are hundreds of hidden semiconductor stocks out there. If you can effectively forecast some of the less-recognized trends and then pin down the best stocks in the sector to capitalize on the trend, you could easily outperform the broader sector.\n\nRecovery and Rebound in 2024\n\nThough semiconductors remained top-of-mind for many investors, the sector itself struggled this year. Widespread demand for the most advanced semiconductors isn’t there yet, while middle-market products aren’t sufficiently profitable to drive solid margins. Expect 2023 to mark a sector-wide 12% sales decline once the dust settles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut winds could be shifting. On the heels of slackened demand, many companies cut production and exhausted existing inventory. That series of strategies seems as though it’ll cause a bullwhip effect as increased demand outpaces inventory and production capability.\n\nAnalysts expect that continued AI developments and renewed consumer confidence leading to more tech purchasing will spark a 20% annual growth rate in 2024. Ultimately, that will benefit semiconductor stocks globally, so investing in a solid manufacturer with this in mind could prove profitable, even if you don’t have the expertise to truly pick the best-in-class semiconductor stock.\n\nStock to watch:Onto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO), which offers testing and quality control solutions for semiconductor stocks – meaning it benefits no matter which company comes out on top.\n\nStory continues\n\nDriver Assistance and Infotainment\n\nThough not the largest semiconductor market segment (edged out by data processing, of course), the automotive sector’s semiconductor demand is growing the fastest. That segment is set to hit 10.3% CAGR by 2025. And, within the rapidly growing segment, driver assistance, safety and infotainment systems are the most chip-hungry subcomponents.\n\nSemiconductors power most vehicular functions today, but increased vehicle “smartness” across legacy and electric segments demands greater semiconductor sourcing. Anti-lock brake systems, airbag management, air conditioning and more all rely on semiconductors like never before. That’s part of what drove the record used car sales throughout the pandemic. New manufacturers, reliant on semiconductors, got hamstrung by global supply chain slowdowns and drove astronomic used car pricing. And that’s without addressing self-driving vehicles. Those systems have a suite of safety features and detection systems that — you guessed it — need a slew of semiconductors.\n\nBut semiconductors benefit even the most basic makes and models, as advances in dashboard infotainment (think CarPlay) are prevalent in even economy models. Infotainment expansion could hit 38% growth through 2023, making it a top semiconductor trend to watch.\n\nStock to watch: Infineon (OTCMKTS:IFNNY), which specializes in EV and infotainment semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nAI in Your Pocket\n\nAI runs on massive amounts of data processing demands, which rely on massive data centers driven by semiconductors. But just as the earliest computers took up entire university halls before shrinking to pocket size, advanced AI applications will shrink to accommodate smaller and more efficient hardware.\n\nMost of that push towards personal AI will be driven by advances in semiconductors and similar tech more than coding or software. The best AI assistant is useless if the hardware won’t support its mobility and lifestyle integration, so stocks pushing to make better chips smaller will be at the forefront of personal AI. Just like today’s mega-stocks were at the fore of personal computing trends, companies able to adapt hardware to suit personal AI applications will be tomorrow’s Magnificent 7 — or bigger.\n\nAt the same time, there is an increased preference for even “dumb(ish)” wearables and fitness tracking tech. These, too, need shrunken semiconductors to effectively integrate wearables with peripheral tech like phones and monitoring systems.\n\nStock to watch: Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), whose partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) puts it at the leading edge of pocket-sized semiconductor applications.\n\nSustainability\n\nThere’s no doubt that, like many emergent tech trends, semiconductor development isn’t environmentally friendly. Semiconductor production demands energy and water in spades while offloading significant greenhouse gasses. A growing environmental impact, alongside indications that tech is hurting the environment through energy usage more than it’s helping through innovation, is kickstarting calls for transparency and climate action within semiconductor companies.\n\nLooking ahead, 2024 and beyond will likely mark a turning point where more semiconductor companies embrace comprehensive sustainability strategies to keep regulatory bodies and consumers happy. But shifting towards sustainability makes business sense, too. Implementing water recycling and renewable energy use helps address direct and supply chain emissions and leads to reduced operating costs. This dual benefit of environmental responsibility and improved financial positioning makes sustainability another top semiconductor trend.\n\nStock to watch: ASM International (OTCMKTS:ASMIY), a Dutch firm recognized as the first semiconductor stock to validate a net-zero path.\n\nMegaplant and Foundry Industry Expansion\n\nAs countries realize the advantage of geographically centralized manufacturing when supply chains slow, expect greater demand for in-house semiconductor plants and foundry development. Though little has come to fruition yet, we’re already seeing the US CHIPS and Science Act push toward semiconductor independence at home.\n\nAt the same time, Japan acts as a model of what prudent positioning looks like. The country is allocating $10 billion toward semiconductor projects, including a second massive Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSMC) plant. At the same time, Japan ensures that TSMC’s expert teams educate internal scientists and researchers to diversify its knowledge base. That’s evident from the collaboration between TSMC and Japan’s own private semiconductor company, Rapidus Corp.\n\nUltimately, Japan stands as a model for national semiconductor industrial expansion by ensuring facility growth remains matched with growing the knowledge base and national brainpower. Hopefully, the US CHIPS Act’s lofty promises will come to fruition, and we, too, can stake a future on independent semiconductor development.\n\nStock to watch: Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSMC).\n\nChina Fights for Dominance\n\nOf course, a major geopolitical sticking point within the semiconductor industry is China. Not only does tension put pressure on the Taiwanese top semiconductor stock, TSMC, but the nation is offering cut-rate price competition in a bid to squeeze other national competitors from the market. Most of that price push comes amid US sanctions that prevent sales to major Western powers, forcing China to make ends meet where it can.\n\nBut, internally, China’s 5G proliferation and Huawei expansion mean the country is increasingly competitive as market forces push for greater innovation. Sanctions mean China’s AI capabilities lag ours as they’re cut off from business with the most advanced manufacturer, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Still, internal advancements continue unabated, and it might be a matter of time until China is as competitive as Nvidia on the national front — especially if they squeeze out competition through cost leadership plays.\n\nTech Talent\n\nTalent management remains top-of-mind within the industry, making companies able to snag the best performers more competitive than their peers. Expect semiconductor companies to dip into global markets more often as at-home talent becomes exhausted. This, of course, presents a double-edged sword. While snagging top talent improves operational outcomes, it comes at a cost — both in compensation and continued training — so fierce competition for a shrinking talent pool could just as likely cause share price troubles.\n\nExpect to see top semiconductor stocks start fostering community development to nurture future talent pools. That could include sponsoring STEM competitions or offering scholarships to talented students. In any case, competition is fierce within the semiconductor sector, and talent acquisition isn’t an exception.\n\nStock to watch: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because name recognition and the top-performing semiconductor spot both go a long way toward attracting top talent.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Legendary investor Warren Buffett has long preached the importance of passive investing in large-cap stocks.\n\n\"Beware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns,\" said Buffett, who also is a big fan of dividend-yielding stocks, which he calls the secret sauce to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s success.\n\nNearly 75% of Buffett's portfolio is invested in just five stocks. Take a closer look.\n\nApple\n\nBuffett has been a long-time supporter of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which he calls a \"better business than any we own.\" Approximately 50.04% of his portfolio is invested in Apple, which was valued at over $155 billion as of Sept. 30.\n\nDespite uncertainty in the market, demand for Apple's products remains strong, with iPhone sales hitting a record high in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Sept. 30. Apple shares have risen 49% year-to-date, making it one of the best-performing tech stocks this year.\n\n“We now have our strongest lineup of products ever heading into the holiday season, including the iPhone 15 lineup and our first carbon-neutral Apple Watch models, a major milestone in our efforts to make all Apple products carbon neutral by 2030,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.\n\nWedbush has an Overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of $250, indicating a potential upside of nearly 30%. Morgan Stanley also has an Overweight rating on the tech behemoth with a price target of $220, indicating a potential upside of over 13%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nBuffett generated nearly $704 million in dividends from his investment in the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO). His initial investment of $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola stock has multiplied to $25 billion, according to Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 annual shareholder letter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola through Berkshire Hathaway, which accounts for 7.15% of his total portfolio.\n\nCoca-Cola currently pays $1.84 in dividends annually, yielding nearly 3.2% on the current stock price. The Dividend Aristocrat stock has a dividend payout history, as it has hiked its annual dividend payouts for 61 consecutive years.\n\nDespite the volatile market backdrop, Coca-Cola is expected to maintain stable growth momentum, as the company's revenue is expected to rise by 4.1% in the quarter ending December. The consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $0.48 for the quarter ending in December indicates a 6.7% year-over-year increase.\n\nBank of America\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns approximately 1.03 billion shares of Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), accounting for over 9% of Buffett's investment portfolio. Shares of Bank of America rose by over 20% in the past three months.\n\nBank of America has benefitted from the decades-high interest rates, as the bank's total net income rose by 10% year over year to $7.8 billion in the fiscal third quarter that ended Sept. 30. Its EPS for the quarter amounted to $0.90, indicating an 11% rise from the same period last year.\n\nBank of America also raised its dividend payouts by 9% back in July, bringing its total annual dividends to $0.96 and yielding 2.89% on the current price.\n\nOdeon Capital Group upgraded its outlook on Bank of America stock from Hold to Buy on Dec. 13 with a price target of $37.94, indicating an over 13% potential upside.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nAmerican Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) is Buffett's third-largest holding, accounting for 7.22% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings. With U.S. credit card debt topping $1 trillion in the second quarter, American Express reported an improvement in its financials. Spending by millennial and Gen Z American Express customers rose by 18% year over year in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Sept. 30.\n\nAmerican Express reported record third-quarter revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 13% from the same period last year. American Express's EPS increased by 34% year over year to $3.30 for the third quarter.\n\nThe consensus revenue estimate of $16.01 billion for the quarter ending in December indicates a 13% year-over-year increase. Wall Street expects the American Express EPS to amount to $2.65 for the quarter, indicating a 13% year-over-year increase.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "title": "Investing Preview 2024: Buy These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Avoid the Others.",
        "content": "Any investing exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks has made your 2023 investing year a big success. This group of mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), has outperformed the broader market despite the Nasdaq Composite surging over 45% last year.\n\nIf it's not broken, don't fix it... right? Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023.\n\n1. Nvidia: Buy\n\nNvidia's chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That's pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAI demand doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia's valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That's a PEG ratio of just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023.\n\n2. Apple: Avoid\n\nNot every \"Magnificent Seven\" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple's revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple's business can be cyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That's fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAnalysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta Platforms: Buy\n\nWall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business, harmful privacy changes to iPhones, and expensive metaverse projects that weren't showing any return on investment. Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs, working through the iPhone challenges, and getting revenue growth and profits back on track. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAstonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta is still a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond.\n\n4. Microsoft: Avoid\n\nChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world's largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it's becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillion market cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock's resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn't as appealing as some other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nIt's not abhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop, there are better deals out there. It's OK for investors to be picky.\n\n5. Amazon: Buy\n\nInterestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the past decade, that's over 20% below Amazon's average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing in developing its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That's not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail).\n\n6. Tesla: Avoid\n\nElectric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It's a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla's operating results. Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year. TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it's striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla's future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla's stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy.\n\n7. Alphabet: Buy\n\nAlphabet's dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world's most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock's 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks dominated the market in 2023. The worst performer in the group, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), rose 49%, and the best, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), jumped nearly 240%. But with such strong runs behind them, do any of them have room left to grow in 2024?\n\nThe answer: Yes, and some are still worth buying at their current prices.\n\nApple and Nvidia are both richly valued for their performance\n\nI'm breaking the seven up into buy, sell, and hold groups. Starting with the sell set, I think Apple and Nvidia's stock prices far outpaced their businesses.\n\nNvidia's 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, and its business has responded in kind. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), revenue rose 206% year over year. Furthermore, management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue, up 231%. The stock's movement was warranted given the company's sales growth, but I'm concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\n\nNvidia goes through boom and bust cycles, and right now is certainly a boom. However, it's unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term. If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly, the stock may come crashing back down to earth. Plus, it's trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, Apple is the opposite of Nvidia. Its sales declined throughout 2023. Even so, its stock skyrocketed. This makes little sense, and more headwinds are coming up: a U.S. International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume). With all this in mind, 2024 could be a tough year for the company. And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than \"Magnificent Seven\" members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), it doesn't make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft and Tesla need to show me some results\n\nI view Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently. Microsoft had a strong year, as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose. However, Microsoft trades at a steep premium, even on a forward earnings basis. MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nMicrosoft is executing well, but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying. Still, it's far from a sell.\n\nTesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street, as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products. It's also set to face some added headwinds. Starting in 2024, some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them.\n\nWhen judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock, I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends. For Tesla, these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022. TSLA PE Ratio Chart\n\nI'm taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesn't look like a bargain at these prices.\n\nAdvertising should bounce back in 2024\n\nThat leaves Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category. These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year.\n\nEven though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments, they are mostly advertising businesses. In 2022 and 2023, the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming. However, now that we have lapped that pullback, Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses. Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24%, respectively, in Q3.\n\nNext year should be another strong recovery year for advertising, which will boost both companies.\n\nAmazon has also had a strong 2023, with its margins rising. AMZN Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nHowever, this chart doesn't tell the full story, as this takes into account Amazon's profits over the past 12 months. If you focus on its latest quarterly results, Amazon's margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4, which is usually its strongest one. No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, but 2024 could give us a glimpse, making it a strong buy now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "10 Stock Market Predictions for 2024",
        "content": "As investors ready to ring in the new year, they have to be thrilled with Wall Street's performance in 2023. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) recently climbed to a record high, with the benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gaining 25% and 44%, year to date, through the closing bell on Dec. 28.\n\nBut it's not about where Wall Street has been, so much as where the stock market is headed next. If there were such a thing as a perfect forecasting tool, everyone would be using it. Unfortunately, there isn't, which means the best we can do as investors is use a combination of history, macro and company-specific data, and our experience, to make predictions about the future.\n\nWhat follows are 10 stock market predictions -- including macro predictions that can have bearing on the performance of equities -- for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. The U.S. economy will dip into a recession\n\nTo start with, the most-anticipated recession in U.S. history will finally take shape in the new year.\n\nThe Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI), which is comprised of 10 inputs and attempts to anticipate turning points in the business cycle, has declined for 19 consecutive months. With the exception of a 22-month decline from 1973-1975 and a 24-month tumble during the Great Depression, we've never seen a clearer sign that an economic slowdown is expected.\n\nFollowing the money also offers a potentially chilling tale for Wall Street, at least in the very short term. Commercial bank credit has declined since mid-February, which signals that banks are purposefully tightening their lending standards.\n\nMeanwhile, M2 money supply is notably falling for the first time since the Great Depression. Less available money for transactions has historically been a telltale sign that an economic downturn is on the horizon.\n\n2. The bear market returns in 2024\n\nAlthough the U.S. economy and stock market aren't tied at the hip, a downturn in the economy tends to have a negative impact on corporate earnings. History tells us that roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500's drawdowns since the start of the Great Depression in September 1929 have occurred after, not prior to, a recession being declared. In other words, if (key word!) a recession was to materialize, a bear market for stocks would probably follow.\n\nStory continues S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nSomething else to consider is that stocks aren't cheap. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings ratio (also known as the \"cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio) ended Dec. 28 at 32.36. That's about 90% higher than its average reading of 17.07, when back-tested 154 years.\n\nFurther, there have only been six instances since 1870 where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E surpassed 30. Following the previous five occasions, the broader market went on to lose between 20% and 89% of its value. While the Shiller P/E isn't a timing tool, it does suggest that extended periods of premium valuations aren't well-tolerated by Wall Street.\n\n3. The second-longest yield-curve inversion on record will end\n\nThe yield curve, which is a chart depicting the yields of various Treasury debt securities relative to their maturity dates, has often been a tell of what's to come for the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nThe US Yield Curve (10-year minus 3-month) has now been inverted for 427 consecutive days, the 2nd longest streak in history. Will likely become the longest inversion ever in February 2024. pic.twitter.com/l1q7cVMwSx\n\n-- Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) December 27, 2023\n\nFor the past 428 calendar days, as of Dec. 28, the yield curve that compares the 10-year Treasury bond to three-month Treasury bills has been inverted. This is to say that shorter-dated debt securities (i.e., the three-month bill) have higher yields than the longer-dated bond. While a yield-curve inversion doesn't guarantee that a U.S. recession is imminent, every recession since World War II has been preceded by an inversion.\n\nThough the current inversion is likely to become the longest on record (currently 469 calendar days, set between Nov. 1965 and March 1967), it's unlikely to persist throughout the new year. With the nation's central bank expected to begin a rate-easing cycle, it wouldn't be surprising for the yield curve to normalize by year's end.\n\n4. One of Wall Street's most-hated industries will thrive\n\nIf the Treasury yield curve inversion ends in 2024, highly interest-sensitive companies could benefit. This includes one of Wall Street's most universally disliked industries: mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nPopular mortgage REITs like Annaly Capital Management(NYSE: NLY) and AGNC Investment(NASDAQ: AGNC) make their living by borrowing money at low short-term lending rates and use this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). The greater the gap between the average yield on owned assets less average borrowing rate (this difference is known as \"net interest margin\"), the more profitable a mortgage REIT can be.\n\nThe yield-curve inversion has narrowed the net interest margin for mortgage REITs and made short-term borrowing costlier. But an end to this inversion, coupled with dovish Fed monetary policy, could make Annaly Capital Management and AGNC Investment absolutely sparkle in the eyes of income seekers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Core inflation will remain stubbornly high, if not reaccelerate\n\nMost investors are likely thrilled with the Federal Reserve forecasting three rate cuts in 2024. When interest rates decline, it encourages companies to borrow, which can accelerate corporate hiring, fuel acquisition activity, and bolster innovation.\n\nBut there's another side to this coin. In recent memory, the Fed has cut rates in response to a growth slowdown. During the third quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis notes that U.S. gross domestic product increased by a red-hot 5.2%. With the nation's central bank planning to reduce rates in 2024, it risks reaccelerating the rate of inflation.\n\nThe core inflation rate, which removes volatile food and energy costs from the equation, could be particularly stubborn in 2024. A rapid uptick in mortgage rates has effectively frozen the housing market. Nothing short of a hard landing for the U.S. economy is likely to bring the core inflation down to the Fed's long-term target of 2%.\n\n6. The artificial intelligence (AI) bubble will begin to burst\n\nOne of the primary catalysts that sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite screaming higher in 2023 is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI, which involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks typically assigned to humans, can add nearly $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to researchers at PwC.\n\nHowever, history isn't on the side of AI's continued success -- at least in the short run. Every single next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has gone through an initial bubble period. While many of these trends produced big-time winners over the long-term, the internet, business-to-business commerce, genomics, 3D printing, marijuana, blockchain technology, and the metaverse are just some of the examples of highly touted \"new trends\" that weren't initially given enough time to mature.\n\nThe potential bubble-popping event for AI could come from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has established itself as the infrastructure backbone of AI-accelerated data centers. Graphics processing unit (GPU) scarcity has sent Nvidia's pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs through the roof in 2023. But as production expands in the new year and competition picks up, Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin appear likely to take a hit.\n\n7. Microsoft will surpass Apple to become the most-valuable public company\n\nWith few exceptions over the past decade, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been the world's largest publicly traded company by market cap. Apple's innovation has been the driving force behind its success. It remains the leading smartphone company by market share in the U.S., and its subscription services segment is rapidly evolving.\n\nBut when examined as a whole, Apple's growth engine has stalled. All of the company's physical products endured sales declines in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023). While a greater than $600 billion share repurchase program since the start of 2013 has helped lift the company's earnings per share, it's no longer the growth story it once was.\n\nWith Apple failing to deliver in the growth department, it's Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) that stands ready to ascend to the top of the pedestal. Microsoft Azure accounted for 25% of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the third quarter, according to Canalys. The company is also benefiting from the abundant cash flow of its legacy operations (e.g., Windows and Office), and its steady stream of acquisitions. Microsoft has the necessary catalysts to become the world's most-valuable public company in 2024.\n\n8. Tesla will fall below $100 per share\n\nKeeping with the theme of Wall Street's most-important and widely owned companies, I fully expect the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker by market cap, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), to fall below $100 per share in the new year. For context, Tesla shares closed at roughly $253 with one trading day left in 2023.\n\nTesla's pricing strategy is a potentially major red flag. During the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, CEO Elon Musk noted that Tesla's pricing strategy is based on demand. With the company slashing prices on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions in 2023, it pretty clearly signals that demand is faltering, inventory levels are rising, and competition is picking up. Tesla's once superior operating margin is now on-par with the auto industry average.\n\nFurthermore, Elon Musk continues to be a tangible risk for Tesla's shareholders. Despite being a visionary, he frequently overpromises and underdelivers when it comes to new innovations. Though Tesla is valued as a do-it-all company in the energy and auto space, it generates the bulk of its profit from selling and leasing EVs (the auto industry usually sports single-digit earnings multiples), and is reliant on unsustainable sources of income for a sizable percentage of its profit. ^SPXUS Chart\n\n9. Utilities will be a top-3 sector in 2024\n\nNext up is the prognostication that the worst-performing sector for the S&P 500 in 2023 will be one of the three best-performing sectors in the new year. I'm talking about utilities.\n\nMost investors flock to utility stocks because of their low volatility, market-topping dividends, and predictable operating performance. But with Treasury yields soaring in response to the Fed's aggressive rate-hiking cycle, investors bid adieu to utilities and opted to purchase Treasury bonds instead. This led to a very poor year for a traditionally safe sector.\n\nBut with the central bank looking to ease interest rates in 2024, utilities are back on the radar as a potential outperformer. The dividend yields of utilities should become more attractive as Treasury bond yields decline. Further, access to cheaper borrowing rates may fuel acquisitions and major projects that ultimately lift growth rates for the sector's major players -- I'm looking at you, NextEra Energy.\n\n10. A short-lived \"crisis\" will take shape\n\nLast but not least is the prediction that an unforeseen event will, at least temporarily, weigh down Wall Street.\n\nAlmost every year features an unexpected event that wreaks havoc on the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. For instance, 2023 saw the short-lived regional banking crisis threaten the fabric of the financial system. The failure of three sizable banks created ripples throughout the financial sector that had investors questioning the solvency of rock-solid banking institutions.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine served as the year's tumultuous event. The geopolitical implications of Russia's invasion led to a short-term malaise for equities.\n\nThough it's impossible to predict what short-term crisis might unfold in 2024, the best guess I can offer is a housing price collapse, or perhaps a wave of auto loan defaults.\n\nOnly time will tell if this or any of these predictions comes to fruition in the new year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 FAANG Stocks to Buy in 2024 and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "The stock market has soared over the last decade. A $10,000 investment made in a market-tracking fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) at the start of 2014 would be worth $29,673 today after having grown at a compound annual rate of 11.6%, assuming that dividends were reinvested along the way.\n\nBut the handful of elite stocks known as the FAANG group has delivered even stronger returns. In the last decade, an equal-weighted and dividend-reinvested portfolio of these five stocks would have grown from $10,000 to $89,051. That's a mind-blowing 24.7% compound annual growth rate. It was a bumpy ride, as the FAANG portfolio outperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracker in five years and underperformed in the other five, but stellar results of 2015, 2020, and 2023 outweighed the weak 2022 period.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with FAANG, I'm talking about these familiar companies:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google.\n\nThe mildest 10-year gain among these top-shelf stocks was 400% for Alphabet. At the other end of the scale, Apple led the way with an 867% share price increase. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker is also the only dividend payer of the bunch; reinvesting those payouts would have lifted an investor's total return on Apple stock to a cool 1,000% in 10 years.\n\nBut even the members of this exclusive club aren't always indisputable buys. Right now, I see two excellent investment opportunities for 2024 in this bunch, but one that investors should avoid until further notice.\n\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 1: Alphabet\n\nThe Google parent took a hard fall in 2022. Both of its dual-class stock types fell by as much as 42% as the company was hamstrung by a rickety global economy and a weak digital advertising market. Overall, Alphabet's stock has gone essentially nowhere over the past two years, posting a loss of 3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, its formerly stalled growth is back in action now. Alphabet's trailing-12-month sales stand at $297 billion today, up from $258 billion in fiscal year 2021. That's 15% higher, in case you prefer to think in percentages. Free cash flow rose from $67 billion to $78 billion over the same period, a 16% increase.\n\nAbove all, Alphabet's future looks bright. The advertising market is coming back from its inflation-induced slump. Google Cloud is a leading provider of cloud-based access to powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and the company even designs its own AI accelerator microchips.\n\nSo Alphabet's stock chart has stalled while the business rekindled its fading growth. These days, Alphabet shares can be had at the modest valuations of 27 times trailing earnings and 23 times free cash flows. These readings stand below their long-term averages, and you know Alphabet will stay relevant in the long run. Ergo, this looks like a great time to scoop up some Alphabet shares on the cheap.\n\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 2: Netflix\n\nIf Alphabet took a bruising in 2022, the market took Netflix behind the woodshed for a proper pummeling. The streaming video pioneer's stock dropped by as much as 72% last year, and despite a strong rebound, Netflix still trades 19% below where it ended 2021. After a brief period when its investment theme was horror story, the company looks more like a wholesome family-friendly feature again, and well worth binge-investing in.\n\nThe thing is, the big drop it took in 2022 never made sense to me. Investors essentially punished Netflix for doing exactly what they had been hoping it would do -- putting a fresh focus on margins and profitable revenue growth. Management's enhanced desire for profitability came at the cost of slower customer growth, which used to be the most essential figure to watch in each of Netflix's quarterly reports. Old habits die hard, and the market's reaction to Netflix's updated strategy was brutal.\n\nNow, Netflix's stock price has approximately tripled from the multiyear low it touched in mid-2021. The most glaringly obvious opportunity to take advantage of the buying window is behind us. Still, Netflix strikes me as a solid buy with reignited growth engines and modest valuation ratios. In particular, Netflix stock is cheaper than ever on a price-to-free-cash-flow basis, which is the exact financial metric the company's critics used to complain about the most.\n\nCash flows may dip somewhat in 2024 as Netflix's content production projects get back on track after the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023, but the long-term trend is clear. Netflix is no longer seeking customers at any cost. Instead, the company is optimizing its cash flows and profits, even at the cost of slower subscriber growth. I'm perfectly fine with that switch, and Wall Street as a whole should eventually embrace it as well.\n\nUntil then, Netflix remains a no-brainer buy in my book.\n\nThe FAANG stock to avoid in 2024: Meta Platforms\n\nI'm not here to throw Meta Platform under the bus, but the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp just doesn't look like a buy right now.\n\nThe company's all-in bet on the metaverse is years away from paying metaphorical dividends. The Reality Labs division's revenues amount to a rounding error in Meta's overall financial structure, clocking in at 0.6% of total sales in the recent third-quarter report. But management is leaning into that potential growth driver with all its might. Those $210 million in third-quarter revenues came at the cost of an operating loss of $3.7 billion for the Reality Labs division.\n\nBut the company exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of this year's four earnings reports and investors see Mark Zuckerberg's business as a promising AI innovator. So the stock has gained 198% in 2023, largely erasing 2022's price drop.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Anders,\" I hear you say. \"Isn't this the same story as Alphabet, which experienced similar share price trends and advertising quirks over the last two years? If you like Alphabet, you should love Meta Platforms too.\"\n\nWell, I see the similarities, but Meta's situation is dramatically different from Alphabet's. The company formerly known as Facebook may have some AI ideas in its holster, but it can't match Google's decades of AI expertise or the AI-infused heft of the Google Cloud service. And if AI is supposed to save Meta from its low-growth morass, the heavy spending on metaverse projects must be viewed as an expensive distraction.\n\nIn sum, Meta Platforms seems like a momentum-powered stock right now, and I'm not convinced that AI will be a game-changer for the company. If and when the broader market reaches the same conclusion, Meta's stock could experience a painful price correction. Until then, I'd rather keep my hands off this overheated social media stock, even if it is part of the market-beating FAANG group.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

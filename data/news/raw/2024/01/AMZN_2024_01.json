        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at Light Street Capital returned 46% in 2023: top 15 picks. If you wish to skip our detailed overview of Kacher’s history, investment philosophy and hedge fund performance, go directly to Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.\n\nGlen Kacher is the founder and chief investment officer at the hedge fund Light Street Capital. He attended University of Virginia where he graduated with B.S. Commerce at the McIntire School of Commerce. He obtained his MBA from Stanford University.\n\nKacher is among the famous figures in the hedge fund industry. The hedge fund boss, who chose to base his operations in Silicon Valley rather than Wall Street, learned investing from some of the industry’s greatest.\n\nPrior to starting Light Street Capital in 2010, Kacher worked as managing director at the hedge fund Integral Capital Partners under industry titan Roger McNamee. During his time at Integral, which started in 1998, Kacher oversaw investments in the technology sector. His investment areas of focus included software, internet services and media.\n\nBefore he joined Integral, Kacher worked for the hedge fund Tiger Management under Julian Robertson – a pioneering figure in the hedge fund industry. Kacher went to work for the billionaire legendary hedge fund manager Robertson’s fund after he graduated college with a bachelor’s degree in commerce in 1993 and remained there until 1997.\n\nAt Tiger, Kacher initially worked as a full-time research analyst. At some point, Kacher transitioned to the role of a part-time investment consultant for the hedge fund. During his tenure at Tiger, he focused on investments in hardware, software and networking industries\n\nKacher came to launch Light Street Capital armed with a graduate business degree, years of experience in investing in the technology space and lessons from some of the industry’s best. Kacher’s Light Street Capital is one of the Tiger cubs – hedge funds whose founders had worked at Tiger Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nLight Street Capital is a tech-focused hedge fund headquartered in Silicon Valley – the global epicenter of technology innovation. The firm has $680 million in assets under management. Light Street invests by applying long and short investment strategies.\n\nBeing based in Silicon Valley, Kacher has had a vantage view of the technology space, allowing him to better understand industry trends and spot opportunities ahead of others. In Silicon Valley, the Light Street Capital founder rubs shoulders with technology innovators, startup founders, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.\n\n\"What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry… It seemed crazy to go back to New York.\" Kacher once told Forbes.\n\nThe Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher’s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.\n\nAlso, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.\n\nAs with all other hedge funds, Kacher’s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2017, Light Street’s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.\n\nBut 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia’s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital. Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 15 Picks\n\nGlen Kacher of Light Street Capital\n\nBut the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.\n\nThe AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.\n\nWhile there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.\n\nKacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.\n\nAs to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.\n\nSoftware companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.\n\nAI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology’s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.\n\nApart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.\n\nAmid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.\n\nIn its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.\n\nWith these details in mind, let’s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nLight Street Capital bounced back in 2023 after the rout of technology companies in 2022 wiped out some 70% of the firm’s assets. The hedge fund benefited from its long positions in some extensive tech stocks that exploded amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Consequently, we have analyzed the hedge fund 13F filings and settled on its top stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on Glen Kacher’s hedge fund’s holdings. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nLight Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top Picks\n\n15. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.27 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 122\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of the stocks behind Light Street Capital returning 46% in 2023. The enterprise software giant is best known for its customer relationship management technology that brings customers and companies together. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)'s service includes sales to store data, monitor leads and progress, forecast opportunities,\n\nSalesforce, Inc.

Paul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, and Will Wurm’s Beech Hill Partners was one of the significant shareholder of the company in the fourth quarter of 2023, with shares worth $3.31 million.\n\nHere is what Polen Capital said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\n14. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.49 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 57\n\nSynopsys, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) stock in the third quarter of 2023. Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the prominent shareholder of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) with 36,714 shares worth $18.90 million.\n\nHere is what TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, said about Synopsys, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SNPS), a supplier of electronic design automation software for use in designing and testing integrated circuits, edged forward 5%. The company reported a solid fiscal fourth quarter and raised forward guidance. Despite macroeconomic concerns, their customers remain focused on developing next generation semiconductors with their electric design automation tools. We trimmed the position as it approached our price target.”\n\n13. Nerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.93 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 22\n\nNerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY) is a technology company that operates a platform that allows people to learn online. Nerdy, Inc.

(NYSE:NRDY) decreased from 25 in the second quarter of 2023 to 22 in the third quarter of 2023, which means that three hedge funds sold their stakes in the company during that period.\n\n12. indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.95 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 25\n\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) is a technology company that provides automotive semiconductors and software solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and electrification applications.\n\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) is benefiting as the digitization of cars rapidly increases thanks to strong demand for electric vehicles and in-cabin infotainment. Indie Semiconductor outperformed the S&P 500 on rallying 34% in 2023 helping propel Light Street Capital to a gain of 46%. Light Street Capital reduced its holdings in indie Semiconductor, Inc.

Here is what it said:\n\n“Indie Semiconductor, Inc. is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for advanced driver assistance systems and connected-car user experience and electrification applications. Shares fell during the quarter due to investor concerns that near-term automotive semiconductor demand will face headwinds because of excess inventory in the automotive semiconductor supply chain, combined with third quarter revenue guidance that slightly missed consensus expectations due to a customer slightly delaying the launch of a new vehicle model where indie had secured a design win (so delayed, not lost sales). As indie steadily ramps new product and design wins into production, we are confident the company will achieve its targeted model of profitability by year end, while effectively doubling revenues as it delivers on its $4.3 billion and growing strategic backlog. We believe indie has the potential to grow from its $200 million revenue run rate today to its targeted $500 million by 2025 and $1 billion by 2028. In the years ahead, indie should benefit as it develops differentiated, highly integrated, energy-efficient products, while the automotive semiconductor vertical remains highly attractive over the long term.”\n\n11. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.17 Million Number of Hedge fund Holders: 286\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a multinational technology company with diverse business interests. Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 278 in the previous quarter. Notably, Paul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, and Will Wurm’s Beech Hill Partners emerged as one of the significant stakeholder in the company, with 52,700 shares valued at $8 million.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”\n\n10. Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.74 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 23\n\nCellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) is a software infrastructure company that develops solutions for legally sanctioned investigations. Its DI suite of solutions allows users to collect, review, analyze, and manage digital data across the investigative lifecycle concerning legally sanctioned investigations.\n\nCellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) was one of the best-performing stocks in the Light Street Capital portfolio as it rallied by 95% in 2023, outperforming the 24% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nThe hedge fund benefited from the rally, having first bought a stake in Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in Q3 2021 and ended up with stakes worth $15.74 million as of Q3 2023.\n\nFor their Q3 2023 shareholdings, 23 of the 910 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey held a stake in Cellebrite DI Ltd (NASDAQ: CLBT). Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was a remarkable shareholder of Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) with stakes worth $2.26 million.\n\nHere is what Greenhaven Road Capital said about Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)– Cellebrite provides tools to law enforcement to extract data (evidence) from cell phones, analyze the data, and manage the data. Solving many crimes without their tools is inconceivable. They are mission critical. One of the best indicators of business quality is pricing power. The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company’s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their “Premium” offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, “premium” but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading “arms dealer” to collect and review data from mobile phones.\n\nOver the course of the quarter, Cellebrite hired an Executive Chairman from the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners. It will be interesting to see if he can apply any of the “Vista playbook” to Cellebrite operations, and if he can help put some of the $230M+ in cash that Cellebrite has on its books to work via acquisitions. At just over 3x 2024 revenue and profitable, Cellebrite is priced at a significant discount to peers, as if growth will evaporate. I suspect that, over time, growth occurs and multiple expands, or a firm like Vista Equity Partners acquires them.”\n\n9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.79 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 81\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a pioneer electric vehicle company that designs, develops, manufactures and sells zero emission motor vehicles, energy generation and storage systems. . Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s automotive segment is known for electric cars, while the energy generation and storage segment designs, manufactures, and sells solar energy generation and energy storage products.\n\nWhile Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was under pressure late last year, it still finished the year up 123%, helping Light Street Capital return 43%. Nevertheless, the hedge fund trimmed its stakes in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) by 42% in Q3 2023 to $15.79 million.\n\nFor their September quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 81 out of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors. Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the significant shareholder of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) with stakes worth $944.85 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nTsai Capital Corporation, an investment management firm, mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”\n\n8. JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.85 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 30\n\nBased in Sunnyvale, California, JFrog Ltd.

(NASDAQ:FROG), up from 27 in the previous quarter.\n\nHere is what Madison Investments said about JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the third quarter, we added two investments to the portfolio (FROG and HAYW). Software provider JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG) sells software tools to the Dev/Sec/Ops space (Development, Security and Operations). Their software forms a critical component of the software development chain. Essentially, large enterprises use FROG’s tools to develop, secure and operate their software infrastructure. We believe J Frog is a very strategic asset that dominates its niche. The company is profitable, with recurring revenues that drive material cash flow, buttressed with a strong balance sheet.”\n\n7. Broadcom Inc.

However, the company’s Cloud division, which is expected to generate growth from selling access to artificial intelligence services, saw its growth rate slow modestly. Juxtaposed with Microsoft’s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google’s stock on the report. While the stock recovered to new highs by the end of the year, the earnings report set back caused the stock to trail behind the S&P 500 with a gain of 6.8% for the quarter.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Best Countries for English Speakers to Work 35 Richest Countries by Median Income 20 Safest Countries for US Travelers in the World\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks Set for a Post-Earnings Take Off",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been hot property over the past few months. With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence and the massive demand for data centers, several companies are making the most of this phase and reporting impressive revenue numbers. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already an industry leader, and it can become difficult to match its rally, other tech stocks are slowly but steadily expanding their market share and could report impressive numbers in the coming weeks. The earnings season is an ideal time to invest in stocks that show high growth potential. Here are the three tech stocks post-earnings ready for take-off. Grab them before they are gone!\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest competitor of Nvidia this year could be the year of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company has faced several challenges in the past but its recent fourth-quarter results are impressive. It beat analyst expectations, and the revenue saw a 10% year-over-year increase to $6.2 billion. The net income hit $667 million, which is a significant rise from $21 million in the same quarter the prior year.\n\nThis is an impressive feat, and there is no stopping AMD. Higher revenue and improved profits are driven by the improvement in the data center segment and the company’s ability to focus on the core business areas. The data center saw a 38% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter, and I believe the company is only getting started. This is a sign that the company’s new products have got a positive response and it could enjoy a robust performance in the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock has the potential to double in the coming months. It might not be able to enjoy a rally like Nvidia, but it can generate significant gains. AMD has already positioned itself as one of the best alternatives for Nvidia chips with the new chip launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral tech giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), have shown interest in using AMD chips. It also enjoys a price advantage over Nvidia’s chips. AMD has a diverse range of products that meet the needs of every consumer. Improved revenue stream and higher adoption of the chips will help AMD soar to new highs this year. Buy the stock before it skyrockets.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a tech giant, and the company has been a winner in the AI space. It already has an established market and is known for its database software which is growing due to generative AI offerings. The company has seen strong demand for its cloud services and saw a significant 52% revenue jump in the cloud infrastructure for the third quarter which came in at $1.6 billion. One big reason to invest in Oracle stock is its partnership with Microsoft Azure, where it is ramping up the data centers and building new ones.\n\nThe future of Oracle is cloud, and this is where it will achieve success. I am expecting record quarterly revenue from the company, and the stock could take off after the earnings. ORCL stock is up by 8% year to date. Once the company reports results, we could see the stock soar. It also boasts a modest dividend yield of 1.40%.\n\nI consider Oracle to be a safe haven stock and have recommended it in the past as well. Since most of its success comes from cloud infrastructure services, it is here to stay and has become highly reliable in terms of revenue growth. The company is aggressively building data centers, and as it scales up the cloud segment, we could see an improvement in the operating margin.\n\nAfter the quarterly results, the management mentioned that the demand for its data centers was “astronomical” and this is something to be excited about. Oracle is now stronger than ever, and this is the time for cloud computing businesses. You will regret not buying this stock.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best tech stocks to add to your portfolio, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is known as a global e-commerce giant, but it is so much more than that. It has become more of a tech company today and is using AI to leverage sales.\n\nWhile Amazon needs no introduction, its subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services company in the world with a massive market. The company might have announced results while you read this, and I am certain that the positive numbers will take the stock on an upward momentum. I believe Amazon will report an exceptional quarter driven by Prime Day, holiday shopping, and a rise in advertising revenue.\n\n2024 could be a stellar year for the company as it shows positive signs of growth with rising demand for AWS. In the third quarter results, AWS revenue increased 12% year over year to hit $23.1 billion, and with the generative AI offerings, we should expect the same level of growth to continue in 2024. The total operating income in the quarter was $11.2 billion out of which $7 billion was from AWS. I am highly optimistic about the future of Amazon and believe it will soar this year.\n\nThe stock is up by 52% in the year and is close to the 52-week high of $161. The stock hasn’t moved much over the past month but could take off post-earnings. This is one blue-chip stock to buy and hold forever.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "25 Most Innovative Economies in 2024: Why WIPO Rankings Are Inaccurate",
        "content": "In this article, we will look into the 25 most innovative economies in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Most Innovative Economies in 2024: Why WIPO Rankings Are Inaccurate.\n\nVarious researchers have defined innovation as an indicator of national competitiveness. While others linked it to the economic growth of a country. However, many factors contribute to a country's innovation, including its research and development and ability to adopt technologies and produce market-competitive products and services.\n\nWhy WIPO Rankings Are Inaccurate\n\nThe Global Innovation Index is considered a significant tool for identifying the most innovative country, by utilizing a variety of indicators. While GII might be an established index to provide a holistic view of innovation in a country, some of its indicators, such as institutions and other governance and infrastructure indicators, do not have a direct impact on innovation, compared to prominent indicators such as R&D or innovative technology product exports. This is what makes the WIPO ranking inaccurate as it equally weights all the factors to compute a final innovation index, instead of prioritizing factors that directly impact the scientific and technological innovations in a country.\n\nThe GII ranks Switzerland as the most innovative country in the world. While Switzerland has made significant progress in science and technology in the past years, the United States is undoubtedly the most innovative economy in the world. As of 2023, the US boasts a GDP of $26.95 trillion and is a leader in science and technology. More than 75% of the most innovative companies in the world are based in the US. The country is home to some of the top universities and research institutes including MIT, Harvard, and Stanford University, among others. The United States also stands as a global leader in sectors including health, finance, and energy, among others. The US is tentatively the biggest research and development spender in the world. It spent a total of $789 billion in R&D in 2021, up $72 billion from 2020. On the other hand, Switzerland reported a total spending of only $35 billion in 2022. These factors combined, position the United States as the most innovative country in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies Contributing to the Innovation in the US\n\nCompanies including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are ruling the US market with their continued innovation and scientific breakthroughs.\n\nWall Street is bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). On January 22, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos raised his price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $175 from $170 and reiterated a buy rating. Over the past 3 months, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has received 37 buy ratings from analysts. The stock has an average price target of $187.40 and a high price target of $220. As of January 31, the stock has surged more than 50% over the past 12 months.\n\nHere are some of the comments from Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"During the quarter, we hosted Amazon Accelerate, our annual seller conference, where we launched a number of new innovations and product developments for our sellers, including Supply Chain by Amazon. We also continue to see durable growth in advertising which grew 25% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by sponsored products as we lean into machine learning to improve the relevancy of the ads we show our customers and enhance our measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers. We have seen strong improvement in our profitability. North America operating income was $4.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9%, up 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen 6 consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of over 700 basis points over these past 6 quarters.\"\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a powerhouse of innovation with its top-notch AI-integrated tools. The company promotes the integration of AI in business processes and daily life to accelerate innovation. On September 27, 2023, the company announced several AI-assisted features across its devices and applications, including AI stickers and editing tools and a conversational AI assistant called Meta AI. Moreover, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is set to launch AI characters and AI studios and creation tools in 2024.\n\nOn January 23, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched Chrome M121 along with experimental generative AI features. The new features will allow efficient browsing and personalized experience for users. The new generative AI features will be available in Chrome on Macs and Windows PCs soon, starting first in the US. The users can navigate to the experimental AI page by going to the settings option in their Chrome account.\n\nWith this context, let's look at the 25 most innovative economies in 2024. 20 Most Competitive Economies In The World\n\n20 Most Competitive Economies In The World\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our article, we defined an innovative country as one that invests highly in research and development and integrates digital technology into its economy. To rank the 25 most innovative economies in 2024, we employed three metrics including R&D Expenditure, High Technology Exports in US$, and Digital Adoption Index (DAI). High technology exports showcase a country's ability to transform its R&D into commercial products and services competing globally. This provided us with a solid framework to identify and rank the most innovative economies in 2024.\n\nFirstly, we sorted the countries based on R&D expenditure and collated a list of 40 countries. Then, we sourced DAI and high-technology exports data of the countries. Then, we assigned ranks to our countries based on each metric, with 1 representing the most innovative country. Finally, we assigned weights to each of our metrics as 40% to R&D Expenditure, 40% to High Technology Exports, and 20% to DAI and computed a weighted average of each country's rank across these metrics to calculate their final score as 'Insider Monkey Score'. Our list ranks the countries in descending order of the calculated score.\n\nOur list does not include Israel due to the current geopolitical situation in the country. Israel's war on Gaza has caused major economic losses in the country disrupting businesses, which makes it challenging to assess its innovation. Hence, we have only included countries that demonstrate resilience and adaptability to foster innovation amidst global political challenges.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 15 best low cost stocks to buy under $75. You can skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market investment trends, and go directly to read 5 Best Low Cost Stocks To Buy Under $75.\n\nThe latest economic indicators suggest that the US economy remains resilient and is in better shape than anticipated, defying concerns of a recession. According to the Commerce Department's report on economic growth, the US economy expanded by 3.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by robust consumer spending on healthcare, dining out, and automobiles. Additionally, holiday season sales surpassed expectations, reaching $964.4 billion during November and December, according to data from the National Retail Federation.\n\nThe strength of the US economy, coupled with the possibility of future rate cuts, has emboldened market bulls to make more optimistic predictions and set higher targets for the S&P 500. For instance, Katie Stockon, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, suggested on CNBC that the S&P 500 could potentially reach 6,100 in the long term if new highs are achieved. Despite some stocks being overbought, Stockon noted signs of strength in the market, indicating the beginning of a bull market. Furthermore, Lori Calvasina from RBC Capital Markets remarked in December that while the market is expected to grow gradually in the second half of 2024, investors may need to pause to digest the significant gains witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn such an environment, potential investors looking to dip their feet in the stock market often seek out low-cost yet potentially lucrative stocks to navigate the world of finance. While these stocks may not provide the same level of security as mega-cap firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), they offer the potential for decent short-term returns due to their volatility. In this context, some of the best cheap stocks to buy include CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), along with others listed below.\n\nStory continues 15 Best low cost Stocks To Buy Under $75\n\nA trader on the floor of a bustling stock exchange, surrounded by a sea of monitors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used stock screeners to shortlist stocks that were trading at a share price of less than $75. The compilation of cheap stocks is derived from their popularity among the 910 hedge funds monitored by Insider Monkey. The roster of 15 best cheap stocks to buy under $75 is organized in ascending order based on the count of hedge funds that held each stock. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)\n\nShare Price as of January 27: $46.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\n\nThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), commonly known as Kroger, is a prominent American retail corporation operating an extensive network of supermarkets and multi-department stores across 35 states in the United States. With a presence in over 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) holds a significant position in the global food retail industry.\n\nKroger Co (NYSE:KR) disclosed its third-quarter financial results earlier in November of 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.95 for the period, surpassing expectations by $0.03. Additionally, the reported revenue stood at $33.96 billion, exceeding estimates by $60 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had investments in The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), representing a slight decline from 43 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes amounted to over $3.13 billion.\n\nOakmark Funds funds mentioned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return approximately 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”\n\nMuch like CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the best cheap stocks to buy.\n\n14.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”\n\n8.

        "content": "On the first episode of the fifth season of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, co-host Alan Murray sits down with some of the world’s most powerful CEOs for dinner at Davos.\n\nThe opening interview for the evening was with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. During their conversation, Murray and Jassy talked about 2024’s biggest opportunities and risks. There was one topic that stood out above all others, just as it did for all the other CEOs at the dinner: generative AI. The one question Jassy wouldn’t answer: How his leadership style differs from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nLeadership Next co-host Michal Lev-Ram joins Murray for the pre-interview chat.\n\nListen to the episode or read the transcript below.\n\nTranscript\n\nAlan Murray: I can't believe this crowd has this much energy this late in the week after a full Davos. [Applause from the crowd.]  So, congrats. Yeah. I want to thank all of you for coming to the best dinner in Davos. [More applause.] This has been proven by AI [laughter from crowd]: Best dinner, best people, best conversation. So, I'm really glad that you've given us some of your time.\n\n[Music.]\n\nLeadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change.\n\nWelcome to Leadership Next.\n\nMichal Lev-Ram: The podcast about the changing rules of business leadership.\n\nMurray: I'm Alan Murray and…\n\nLev-Ram: I'm Michal Lev-Ram.\n\nMurray: Welcome to the fifth season of Leadership Next, Michal. I can't believe we've been doing this for four years and have a fifth to go.\n\nLev-Ram: We're so old. [Laughter.] That's pretty awesome.\n\nMurray: We've had a lot of CEOs from a lot of the best-known companies in the world on over the course of those four years. But one thing we have never had, until this episode, is the CEO of Amazon, the number two company on the Fortune 500 list, vying for one of the most valuable companies in the world. Jeff Bezos alluded us, but recently Andy Jassy joined Fortune at our annual CEO dinner in Davos.\n\nStory continues\n\nLev-Ram: Speaking of Bezos, by the way, I think he only talks space these days. So, unless we do an episode devoted to that, we're not getting him.\n\nMurray: I’m in.\n\nLev-Ram: It would be cool. It would be cool. In your view, what was different about Bezos as a leader and Jassy? And obviously it's a different era now for Amazon.\n\nMurray: What I've been told and what I've observed is Bezos is famous for his customer obsession. Everything was about the customer. You read the letter that he wrote every year, it’s customer, customer, customer. And I think he reached the point where employees started to feel like they were chopped liver saying, “Hey, wait a minute.” Yeah, the customer is important, but what about us? And I do think Jassy has changed the approach a little bit, is perceived as a little more employee friendly, a little more focused on a variety of stakeholders and not relentlessly focused on technology and customers at the cost of everything else. But what was interesting in the interview, I made several attempts to get him to compare himself to his predecessor. He absolutely refused to take the bait. He was not going to play that game no matter how hard I tried.\n\nLev-Ram: Tell us about Davos. How was it this year? What was different? What stood out?\n\nMurray: You know, it's such a strange experience because you get this incredible concentration of CEOs and other prominent people. The president of Poland was there, President Zelensky from Ukraine was there, the secretary of state from the U.S., the premier from China, all in this tiny little ski town in Switzerland. And you know, you run into them walking across the street, etc. We, for nine years, have gathered together the CEOs who were in town for a dinner on the Thursday night of the event. Andy Jassy has attended a couple of times in the past. He agreed to come and be the opening interview and then we had table discussions with all of the CEOs where they talked about the same thing that Andy did, which was what are the big opportunities and the big risks that lie ahead in 2024? And what you're going to hear is that number one on that list and probably number two, number three and number four on that list is AI.\n\nLev-Ram: Well, I know he also brought up beef tournedos. Can you explain what that is?\n\nMurray: There was a menu on the seats in front of us and he saw beef tournedos and was trying to figure out what that meant. Thought it must be beef twisted like a tornado here. I'm Googling it right now. It's just pan-seared beef.\n\nLev-Ram: Okay. I thought it…\n\nMurray: …dressed in a red wine mushroom sauce.\n\nLev-Ram: So your challenge now is…\n\nMurray: I don't know.\n\nLev-Ram: So your challenge now is to work this into some kind of metaphor for the economy. The economy is in a beef tournedo. You know, it's interesting, Amazon, obviously, I mean, we think of it as the everything store. It's the everything company, right? It is just mind boggling how much we interact with Amazon and its various brands.\n\nMurray: He talked about that. He talked about different tentacles. He talked about what they're doing in medicine. You know, they bought a company called One Medical. I think any company that wants to try and transform medicine in the United States deserves our support.\n\nLev-Ram: Good luck to them.\n\nMurray: It's a massive company that touches our lives in so many ways, which is why this interview was so much fun. I'm really, really sorry you weren't there, Michal. But let's dive in and remind everyone that this is in a tight room in a tiny little ski village in the Swiss Alps with about 80 CEOs of big global companies. So it's a different context than our normal Leadership Next.\n\n[Music.]\n\nAndy Jassy, why don't you come up here and join me? [Applause.] I think he needs no introduction. You guys have heard of Amazon. One-and-a-half million people, one-and-a-half trillion dollars in market cap. But I learned something really interesting tonight for the first time—that you almost came to work for Fortune. You want to you want to share that story?\n\nAndy Jassy: Well, I had. First of all, it's great to be here with all of you. I was telling Alan that I thought you were going to talk about the beef tournedos. I was hoping…\n\nMurray: We will get to that.\n\nJassy: In between my first job and going to graduate school, when I was applying, I had this recruiter call me about Fortune magazine, and I had a lot of friends I'd worked with before who were there. I had a lot of respect for Time Inc. I got the offer, and I almost did the job instead of going to business school, and then I decided to go to graduate school.\n\nMurray: It's like Fortune, Amazon, Fortune, Amazon.\n\nJassy: It was business school.\n\nMurray: You made a good decision.\n\nJassy: It was just luck. Total luck.\n\nMurray: You got it right. I want to start by asking you the question that everybody in this room is going to be asked to address tonight, because this is where we really get value out of this dinner. Look at the year ahead. What do you see as the single biggest opportunity facing business and the single biggest risk facing business?\n\nJassy: Well, of course, everything we think we know today may be different three months from now. So take this with a grain of salt. I would say that to me, I think the opportunity and risk is pretty similar in that there is this wildly transformative, disruptive technology in generative AI, that you can't get through any conversation without talking about. And I think people, as they, you know, people were on this march pre-pandemic to modernize their technology. You know, it's just part of, you know, I used to manage this business, this AWS business, our cloud computing business. And people were on this march to modernize their technology, to be able to have a lower cost structure, and have better developer productivity, and innovate at a faster clip. And then the pandemic happened. And then we had this economy where everyone, you know, most enterprises tried to figure out how they could save money in any way they could, ours included. And a lot of the low-hanging fruit and cost optimization has attenuated over the last several months, and we're back to starting to invest. I just see companies really battling with the prioritization between are they better off continuing with that modernization of their technology platform or should they spend all their new engineering resources on generative AI?\n\nIn my opinion, you have to think, again, it's prioritization. Everyone will decide differently. I think you have to think about it in a balanced way because, to me, if you don't set, basically, if you don't have your technology infrastructure foundation right, you are going to have a hard time being successful with generative AI. And actually it's such a sure win to be able to modernize your technology and move to the cloud that, to me, it has a very predictable payback. And yet at the same time, I think you would be foolish not to figure out how to use generative AI successfully. I think everyone is trying to figure out how to be successful in a cost effective and higher ROI way. And so I think that, to me, a lot of companies will end up deciding to take the sure successful win of modernizing their technology platform and setting their foundation right, and then picking at least one or two generative AI initiatives where they can learn how to run it. They can learn how to be successful, they can figure out what you got to do to get the right ROI and right customer experience for your business. But it's got to be a balance, in my opinion.\n\nMurray: Do you think Davos has overdone the AI thing a bit?\n\nJassy: I mean, I don't think Davos is unique to that. Yeah, I think it is so exciting. It's really, it has the chance to transform virtually every customer experience. I mean, we're building 60-ish applications right now.\n\nMurray: Yeah, yeah. Let me ask you about that because, yes, every conversation for the last four days has been about AI and particularly generative AI. But when you talk to people about it, they generally talk about Open AI and Microsoft. Maybe they talk about Google, maybe they bring in Meta, but they don't talk about Amazon. I mean, do you feel like you have missed, been behind the braid a little bit on this or what? Why are we not hearing Amazon in the same sense?\n\nJassy: I don't. Know who you're talking to Alan. [Laughter from crowd.] Not our customers.\n\nBut, you know, I think that most of the conversation, in my opinion, on generative AI so far has really been at the application layer. So, things like ChatGPT, which is by the way, a really remarkable application. But the way that we think about AI is it has three layers of the stack, and all three are massive, and we're investing very heavily in all three. But you know, at the bottom layer, if you're going to build your own large language models, you're going to have to train the models. And the key to training is compute, and the key to compute is the chip in the compute, and today there's really been one GPU chip provider, and many of you probably know it's hard to get capacity right now. And people are wondering, you know, what the cost structure is really going to be like.\n\nAnd so, you know, about five years ago we invested in building our own custom AI chips, and we have a chip that we've built for training called Training, and one that we built for inference called Inferential. And we're on the second version of those chips, and they're going to be meaningfully more price performant than what you see elsewhere. And so, you know, when you get into, I think customers who build models are starting to figure out the cost equation is maybe a little bit different than they thought. And then the dirty little secret—if you have generative AI apps in production at scale like we do in a bunch of areas like Alexa—is that almost all the cost ends up being in the inference. You know, you train, take Alexa, you train periodically, but we have billions of predictions or inferences coming, you know, every day. And so people are going to really care about that price performance. So that bottom layer is an area I think people are going to care about.\n\nAnd then at that middle layer, it's really for companies that don't want to build their own large language models. They want to use somebody else's and customize it with their own data. And, you know, we built a service called Bedrock there that does just that. It basically takes our own large language models, and then Anthropic’s and Meta’s with Llama 2 and Cohere and Stability AI. And you know, it takes whatever hard language models you think you want to use, you can customize it with your own data, not leak it back into the general model, and they have the same security and access control and features that you run in the platform. And that also, like, what you're learning, when you actually talk to companies or if you have your own experience building generative AI apps, you realize that it's not going to be one model to rule the world. It’s going to be lots of different models that are better at different things. And then, you know, to try to get the quality that you need for your customers and your reputation at the cost structure and the latency you need for the customer experience, it's actually not simple. And so one of the attractive parts of something like Bedrock is you can move between models and between sizes and models to experiment and find the right experience.\n\nAnd, you know, and then there's that top layer which are the applications. And you know, there's, there's ChatGPT. But I think another really compelling application in the early days is the Coding Companion. And, you know, we launched a single months ago called Queue that writes code for you, it debugs the code and tests the code, it does transformations in both versions of Java to the new versions, and it looks at your data repositories and lets you answer questions. So all three layers of those stacks. Now that stack is important, and we're making big investments in all those areas, and I think it's still quite early days, but…\n\nMurray: But you feel comfortable with where you are now?\n\nJassy: It is so early. This is like three steps into a marathon, but our customers really like what we're building.\n\nMurray: Well let me ask you, in my house and many of our houses, the first time we started talking to the furniture was Alexa, as you mentioned. So how does Alexa fit in to this process?\n\nJassy: Yeah, well, you know, Alexa, like a number of different areas inside our company, is one of the many businesses that is building a significant large language model. And, you know, Alexa as you know, you've used Alexa for lots of different things, but we're building a much more expansive, large language model that is aimed to fulfill our broader vision, which has always been the vision for Alexa, which is to be, you know, the world's best personal assistant.\n\n[Music starts.]\n\nMurray:  I’m here with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte U.S., the sponsor of this podcast. Thanks for sponsoring and thanks for joining me, Jason.\n\nJason Girzadas: It's a pleasure to be with you, Alan, and our privilege to sponsor this important podcast.\n\nMurray: It's great to have you. This whole notion of generative AI is really exploded onto the scene and into our consciousness in the last year. It's the fastest introduction of a new technology in history. How do business leaders deal with that and how do they separate the hype from the opportunity?\n\nGirzadas: It's a great question, Alan. The hype is real, but we also think the opportunity is more real and in fact an imperative for all businesses. The opportunity right now for businesses is around taking advantage of generative AI and other digital technologies for efficiency and productivity gains, with the belief they will continue to evolve and mature, such that there's other opportunities for value creation and that new disruptions and innovations that we haven't even seen the possibilities of. The challenge just to balance this opportunity. As a result, businesses have to diversify their approaches. It's a CEO level priority, but an understanding of where and how these models are being put to use in your business operations. What are the controls put around data and data quality, as well as ensuring that the models are tested and actually validated like you would do any other customer facing or highly sensitive system in an enterprise environment.\n\nMurray: Jason, thanks for your perspective and thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next.\n\nGirzadas: Thank you.\n\n[Music ends.]\n\nMurray: So, I want to talk to…you've been in this job for two years now, right?\n\nJassy: Two and a half.\n\nMurray: Two and a half. Okay. So you've learned a lot. You've experienced a lot. How would you say your leadership style is different than your predecessor?\n\nYou can do this, Andy. Come on.\n\nJassy: Well, I mean, you know, it's a trick question, but then, you know, look, I grew up at Amazon. You know, I've been in Amazon for 26-and-a-half years, and I've done so many different jobs there, and I've been lucky enough to work closely with Jeff. I worked directly for Jeff for 20 years. So, you know, I feel like I learned from somebody who's arguably the most unusual business leader of our era. So, you know, I'm lucky that way. But I do think that every era of business leadership, I think everybody knows this in this room is different. When I started the job, nobody really predicted that the pandemic would last that long, and Omicron would come, and the war in Ukraine would come, and the inflation. I mean, you know, there's lots of things that happened throughout, and you have to just keep adjusting. And that's what we tried to do as a team.\n\nMurray: But when you now, you have two and a half years to look back, how is it different? Granted, anybody in the job would have changed. But how do you think the leadership at Amazon is different than it…?\n\nJassy: Well, I don't, you know, we have a very, yeah, we have a set of leadership principles, there are 16 leadership principles that we, you know, carefully crafted and recrafted over the years. I think the leadership principles are quite consistent. I think the leaders are very consistent culturally. It's just we have different, we have some different folks leading the businesses at this point.\n\nMurray: Yeah, I could keep trying, but you probably don't want me to.\n\n[Laughter from audience.]\n\nJassy: You have to decide how long you want to go on.\n\n[More laughter.]\n\nMurray: Okay, let's see. Where can we go from there? One of the things that has come up in a number of conversations over the course of the last week is with everyone imagining these incredible options for using AI, there is a question about where does the compute power and where does the electricity come from to run all these massive applications? Amazon has been early and strong on sustainability, but how does this explosion in interest in complicated, massive compute power make you think about sustainability?\n\nJassy: Well, you know, I think we all I've been in the Fortune dinner business, maybe my third or fourth year, and we always talk about how important the environment is and how critical it is. And like a lot of you know, we have this thing called the Climate Pledge where we've, you know, pledged to be carbon zero by 2040. And for a company like ours, it's different than most technology companies. We're already well over 90% renewable energy now. We’ll be 100% in 2025. But to get all the way there, when you have to ship as many products as we do with as many trucks and you know, the packaging and all the buildings, it's quite difficult.\n\nAnd I think it's interesting what's happened with power. I think that a lot of the municipalities around the world underestimated how much power was required. In fact, several of them told us they just took our estimates and cut them by a third. They just didn't believe them. And that was during the pandemic and that was before, you know, generative AI came about. You know, generative AI and these large language models are so power hungry that it's been an explosion in demand, and there's not enough energy right now. And so, we're going to have the dual challenge as a group to find a lot more energy to satisfy what people want to do and what we can get done for society with generative AI. But we've got to do it in a renewable way, in a carbon neutral or zero way. It can't be going back to coal. So that that will require a lot of development, and we’ll have to be part of that.\n\nMurray: So what's the next big thing to come from Amazon? I mean, is it health? You made this investment in One Medical. What's the thing that excites you that could be a fourth pillar for Amazon?\n\nJassy: Well, there are so many things that I'm excited about. This is a hard, this is not a soup question. You know, I think that I'm very bullish on what we're doing with Prime Video. You know, I think the combination of the customer experience, the content we build ourselves, you know, the sports that we have and then all of our third-party media partners who are part of our channels program, we're trying to build the place as the best selection of streaming video. And I think that customers, you know, the growth that we've had there, the growth in engagement, the growth in customers, the marketplace, I’m very bullish about that business and how it's progressing. I also think, you know, there's still 400 to 500 million households around the world that don't have broadband connectivity. And so they can't do the things we take for granted. They can't do education online. They can't do their jobs online. They can't watch entertainment, they can't buy. And so we're pursuing this Earth orbit satellite that we call Kuiper that we think will have a real meaningful impact on a lot of people around the world, particularly in rural areas that I also think will be… it's a big capital investment, but I think it will help a lot of people and it will be a good business as well.\n\nMurray: When will you start to roll that out?\n\nJassy: We'll start to roll it out this year. You know, we did our first two big end-to-end test satellites in October that really performed very well. So there's a lot of demand for that. There's demand on the government and the enterprise side, and consumers are excited about it too.\n\nMurray: Health care? There are a lot of people curious about where you're going in health care.\n\nJassy: You know, I feel like when my parents tell me that they didn't have color TV, you know, I just kind of roll my eyes. Like my kids, you know, roll their eyes when I said we didn't have the internet when I was growing up or mobile phones. But I think that my kids’ kids will not believe what the health care experience was for us. Like the fact that if you want to go see a doctor, you got to make an appointment three or four weeks out, you got to drive 20 minutes and park. You have to wait in the waiting room for 15 minutes. Then they put you in an exam room. You go, wait 10 minutes for the doctor. Doctor sees you for 10 minutes and you drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy, I mean, that experience is just kind of nutty. And that that will completely go away with the way the future of health care is. And so One Medical is a different way of doing primary care. It has an amazing digital interface. You can chat with doctors, you can do video conferences, you can make appointments same day or next day. You can get into specialists same day or next day. All the reservations are integrated. And then if you whatever pharmaceutical needs you have, they're connected to Amazon Pharmacy and to a bunch of others that you just get sent to your house within a day. So it's a very different experience and, you know, pharmacy for us was not a big extension. We've been asked by customers for so long to do that, and that business has grown really quickly, and I think will be big as well. But we're really trying to get at changing the core health care experience, starting in the U.S., which I think has not been a happy place for a lot of people.\n\nMurray: We're just about out of time here. But you've got this massive antitrust case against you from the FTC. I mean, anything to that.\n\n[Jassy laughs.]\n\nI'm trying to make it easy for you.\n\nJassy: Well, what I would say to that is I am aware of it and…\n\n[Laughter from crowd.]\n\nMurray: I’ll ask you another question. Have you watched the video of Bill Gates being deposed in the 1990s in his antitrust case?\n\nJassy: No, I haven't.\n\nMurray: You haven't? You should.\n\nJassy: Okay.\n\nMurray: Yeah, I would strongly recommend you do.\n\nJassy: You know, I think all I can say about that is I think that I think they're wrong on the facts and the law. I think that will be borne out over time. How they go in general, we need to be careful in in Western countries not to kill innovation and not, you know, there's a lot of consolidate in various industries, and if we only, you know, have strong regulations in Western countries, you'll leave the playing field open in other spots you don't mean to.\n\nMurray: Is there anything that I haven't asked you that I should have?\n\nJassy: Not that I'm aware of.\n\nMurray: Good.\n\nJassy: If I knew what beef tournedos….\n\nMurray: You're going to find out in just a minute. Go ahead. Take your seat. Thank you for doing this. It was great talking to you.\n\nLeadership Next is edited by Nicole Vergara.\n\nLev-Ram: Our executive producer is Chris Joslin.\n\nMurray: Our theme is by Jason Snell.\n\nLev-Ram: Leadership Next is a production of Fortune Media.\n\nMurray: Leadership Next episodes are produced by Fortune's editorial team.

        "title": "Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Amazon (AMZN) Now",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Amazon (AMZN) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 7.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 35.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 27.5%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Amazon has an S/TA ratio of 1.17, which means that the company gets $1.17 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.8, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Amazon is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 11.5% this year versus the industry average of 9.7%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Amazon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.7% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmazon has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Earnings season steps it up a notch this week as over 400 companies are expected to report earnings. Many of them are large cap growth stocks, including several Magnificent 7 stocks like Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms.\n\nBut the Mag 7 aren’t the only stocks hitting new highs. There are plenty of other companies doing so as well, including some of the top growth stocks on the Street. We’re going to get earnings reports from these companies as well.\n\nCan They Beat Again?\n\nIt’s difficult to have a perfect earnings surprise track record. But even one or two misses, over the last 5 years, is a tremendous earnings surprise record because that time period included the pandemic.\n\nCompanies had to navigate government lockdowns and a spooked consumer. But these 5 have come out of it and are looking beyond the pandemic now.\n\nCan they beat and move higher?\n\n5 Must-See Earnings Charts\n\n1.    Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO)\n\nTractor Supply has only missed 4 times on earnings over the last 5 years but two of those misses were in 2023. However, it’s coming off of a beat last quarter.\n\nShares of Tractor Supply have rallied 19.1% over the last 3 months but are up just 1.6% over the last year. It trades with a forward P/E of 22 as the shares have stalled.\n\nShould Tractor Supply be on your short list?\n\n2. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple has a great earnings surprise track record. It has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2023.\n\nShares of Apple are up 31.5% in the last year and are hitting new all-time highs. It’s not cheap. Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.8.\n\nWill Apple’s report be a catalyst for even more new highs?\n\n3.    Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com has beat big over the last 4 quarters but had 3 misses prior to that time, in 2022.\n\nShares of Amazon.com are up 60.4% over the last year and are hitting new multi-year highs, but are not yet back to all-time highs. It’s not cheap, with a P/E of 43 but Amazon.com trades with a P/S ratio of just 3.0.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould Amazon.com be on your short list?\n\n4. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\n\nMeta Platforms has beat 4 quarters in a row. But the real story is the turnaround in the shares, which have skyrocketed 114% over the last year to new all-time highs.\n\nMeta Platforms has attractive valuations at a forward P/E of just 22.3.\n\nIs Meta Platforms too hot to handle in 2024?\n\n5. Deckers Outdoor Corp. (DECK)\n\nDeckers has two of the hottest shoe brands in UGG and Hoka. It also has a hot earnings surprise chart as it has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2021.\n\nShares of Deckers have soared 84% in the last year and are trading at new all-time highs. It’s not as cheap as it used to be, with a forward P/E of 32.\n\nIs Deckers too hot to handle in 2024?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN in her own personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Following Donald Trump’s commanding victories in both the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, coupled with the withdrawal and subsequent endorsement from contenders Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis, the path to the Republican nomination is increasingly pointing towards him. This development places two specific real estate investment trusts (REITs) in a favorable position to capitalize on Trump’s potential comeback to the presidency.\n\nCrown Castle\n\nCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI), offering a significant dividend yield of 5.8%, specializes in cell towers and extensive fiber networks essential for high-speed data transmission and mobile connectivity. With a potential emphasis on infrastructure development under a Trump-led government, Crown Castle’s strategic assets are likely to become even more valuable, as efforts to enhance national communication networks gain priority, potentially driving up CCI’s profitability and appeal to investors.\n\nCrown Castle’s major clients typically include large national wireless carriers, internet service providers, and potentially government entities involved in national security and infrastructure.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.\n\nCharles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:\n\n''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,\" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.\n\nIn 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nCharles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy\n\nSkylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to \"extrapolate\" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who \"can anticipate change before it is obvious.\"\n\nValue or Growth?\n\nCharles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.\n\n\"It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,\" the fund's website says. Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Skylands Capital's Q3'2023 portfolio and picked its top ten technology stock picks. Why do we pay attention to what hedge funds are doing? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,318,380\n\nSkylands Capital bought a new stake in entertainment and games company Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund's stake in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was valued at $1.3 million as of the end of September 2023.\n\nIn December, Jefferies said it believes the gaming industry will see a slowdown in 2024 as gamers become more selective and prudent with their purchases. Jefferies said at the time that even though Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was expected to post 2025 guidance below expectations, its upcoming games like Battlefield, Sims, Skate and new Star Wars titles will \"re-accelerate topline and drive margin expansion.\"\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA).\n\n9. Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,406,860\n\nIndustrial technology company Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) ranks ninth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital owns a $1.41 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). Over the past one year the stock has gained about 50% in value.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 23 hedge funds had stakes in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) during this period was Chuck Royce's Royce & Associates which owns a $49 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT).\n\nLike Vontier, hedge funds are also investing in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\n8. Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,433,715\n\nSatellite technology company Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) ranks eighth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, owns a $2.4 million stake in Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM). Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a new stock pick of the hedge fund.\n\nIn November, Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) CEO Matthew J Desch bought 28,000 shares of Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) at $37.01 per share.\n\nBaron Growth Fund made the following comment about Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium’s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company’s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium’s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company’s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.”\n\n7. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,612,316\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top tech stock picks of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet since his hedge fund Skylands Capital has a $2.6 million stake in the ecommerce retailer which is also a part of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that have gained a lot amid the AI boom.\n\nUBS recently published a list of quality stocks it believes could outperform in 2024. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was part of the list. UBS said in its note that these Buy-rated stocks are in \"30% top for quality, have positive earnings momentum, are not crowded -- have a crowding data score better than 0.1 -- and have reasonable value without overly high beta.\"\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the most popular technology stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 286 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”\n\n6. SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $4,148,033\n\nSaaS company SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) ranks sixth in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Charles Paquelet. Skylands Capital had a $4.1 million stake in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nEarlier this month, Citi published its Thematic Equity Strategy report in which it named its top picks in major themes. SS&C was its top stock pick in the fintech theme.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC). The biggest stakeholder of SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) during this period was Richard S. Pzena's Pzena Investment Management which owns a $748 million stake in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC).\n\nIn addition to SSNC, Skylands Capital is also invested in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our bottom contributors in Q3 were all from our long book, including HCA Healthcare and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC). SS&C Technologies, a provider of software and services to investment firms, brokerages and other financial institutions, has faced slower organic growth in recent quarters as its business units have produced inconsistent results. Further, rising costs have crimped margins — issues we believe will eventually stabilize but which we are monitoring closely. However, we believe the market is overly pessimistic about the company’s ability to improve its organic growth rate and its margins and are maintaining our position.”\n\nClick to continue reading and seeHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years 10 Best Long-Term Tech Stocks To Buy 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer is Bullish on These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nThese days, Jim Cramer is continuously talking about the broader market rotation out of AI and mega-cap tech towards stocks with lower valuation multiples. In his latest program, Cramer said that stocks from bank, steel and auto sectors are getting a lot of attention from the Wall Street. Cramer said in this environment he would buy stocks like General Motors that is trading four times earnings. Cramer said \"to raise the money\" to invest in undervalued stocks like GM, \"I will sell shares that trade 40 times earnings.\"\n\n\"Charnel House\" of Tech Stocks?\n\nCramer said that the money going into undervalued stocks cannot be \"enticed\" into \"what looks like a charnel house\" of tech stocks. Cramer also mentioned Wells Fargo and said investors in this environment would prefer to buy Wells Fargo which trades at lower multiples and also offers dividends instead of buying software stocks with higher earnings multiples or no earnings at all.\n\nJim Cramer also said that looking at some technical charts shows him that tech stocks are headed for major \"reversals.\"\n\nJim Cramer advised investors to practice patience in this environment and said it would be wise to process all the information as it comes before making any decisions.\n\nDespite constantly talking about this market rotation, Cramer also talks about how he's not worried about the lack of market breadth and concentration of market returns in tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). He recently said that his Charitable Trust owns the \"super six\" stocks (all Mag. 7 stocks minus Tesla) and there's a reason why all market gains were coming from tech stocks. Cramer said major tech companies make products and services for the Enterprise which has \"a lot of money\" to spend.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer is Bullish on These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 stocks Cramer is bullish on and recommended investors to buy. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nIn a latest program Jim Cramer was asked about Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) as the questioner said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is everywhere because of its digital images. Cramer initially appeared reluctant as he said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) went public via SPAC and if it hadn’t been a SPAC he'd be more excited about the stock. But Cramer at the end said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is a Buy.\n\n\"At five bucks I would actually own that stock. It is all over the place.\"\n\nGetty Images talked about how it's using generative AI in its business during its Q3 earnings call:\n\n\"In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images’ best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people.\n\nIt also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively. We are rewarding our contributors with an ongoing share of each and every dollar we earn from the service.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n9.

Earlier this month, Jim Cramer said that Timken Co (NYSE:TKR) shares are \"so cheap down here.\" Cramer also said he thinks the stock is \"real good.\"\n\nEarlier this month D.A. Davidson gave a Buy rating to Timken Co (NYSE:TKR). DA Davidson's analyst Michael Shlisky said in his note that Timken Co (NYSE:TKR) is one of the “best of breed” stocks. The analyst set a $92 price target on the stock.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 25 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Timken Co (NYSE:TKR).

PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) stock recently touched new highs after posting strong fourth-quarter results.\n\nJim Cramer after the results said PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) is a ‘true innovator’.\n\nThe company in its latest earnings call talked about its guidance:\n\n\"In 2024, the European economy is forecast to grow modestly. We expect the above 16-tonne truck registrations to be in the range of 260,000 to 300,000. Last year, the South American above 16-tonne truck market was 110,000 vehicles and is expected to be similar this year. In Brazil, DAF achieved a record 10.2% share, up from 6.9% last year. DAF Brazil makes a growing contribution to PACCAR’s global success. PACCAR full year truck parts and other gross margins were 19.3% and were 19.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong truck deliveries and excellent parts business. We estimate PACCAR’s worldwide first quarter truck and parts gross margins to remain strong and be in the range of 18.5% to 19%. 2023 was another great year for PACCAR with many highlights, including revenue and net income records.\n\nPACCAR announced a joint venture to manufacture commercial vehicle batteries. DAF opened a new electric truck assembly plant and earned the Green Truck award as the most fuel-efficient truck in Europe.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG). An energetic Cramer said \"we like those guys so much.\" Cramer added that Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) offers \"all the kind of energy I like\" under one roof.\n\nConstellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) shares have gained about 46% over the past one year.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG).\n\nIn addition to Constellation Energy, Jim Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nSound Shore Management made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On the plus side of the ledger, we had strong contributions from independent power producers Vistra and Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG). Both stocks surged with higher US electricity prices as strong summer demand exposed reliability issues in many regions of the nation’s electric grid. Meanwhile, Midwest focused Constellation is the biggest producer of carbon-free electricity in the US with nuclear power plants representing the majority of its capacity. We added the name in January 2023 when the stock was trading at a below normal 15 times earnings. Our research identified an upside to earnings power from maturing hedges and regulatory changes, including the Inflation Reduction Act’s nuclear credit. A recent spinout from Exelon Corp, we viewed the strength of Constellation’s clean, reliable baseload power model as an appealing and high potential offering for residential and commercial customers. The company’s recent contract to supply Microsoft at premium power prices is evidence of the opportunity. Constellation is yet another example of an industry undergoing tremendous change that can offer attractive investment opportunities for investors with patience and a research process to uncover specific companies that are well positioned.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 12 Recent Additions Jim Cramer Says Recession Is Not Coming and Recommends These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Rivian Revelation: Why It’s Time to Shift Gears and Buy RIVN Stock Now",
        "content": "It seems like analysts just can’t agree about electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). Some of them reduced their price targets on the stock while also publishing “buy” or “hold”-equivalent ratings on Rivian shares. So, we’ll just have to conduct our own RIVN stock analysis. In the end, I think you’ll find that it’s a great time to invest in Rivian.\n\nThis year should be an exciting one for Rivian Automotive and its stakeholders. Currently, Rivian is getting ready to build its second EV manufacturing plant in Georgia. Yet, apparently some investors and analysts see little upside potential for Rivian stock. Maybe they’re wrong, and maybe there’s an opportunity here.\n\nRIVN Stock: Weighing the Concerns and Opportunities\n\nLet’s start off with the elephant in the room: Ford (NYSE:F) reduced the production pace of its F-150 Lightning EV model and will transition around 1,400 workers because of weak EV demand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKnowing this, RIVN stock investors might worry about weak demand for Rivian’s R1T truck model. However, there aren’t any company-specific press releases indicating soft demand for the R1T.\n\nAt this point, investors should wait for more data from Rivian Automotive instead of jumping to conclusions. Maybe the “EV winter” will end soon and won’t be as bad as the panic-sellers think it is.\n\nI seriously doubt that giant companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and AT&T (NYSE:T) would forge fleet-electrification deals with Rivian Automotive if they didn’t have conviction in Rivian. With RIVN stock recently falling to the $15 area, it feels like the market is simply ignoring Rivian Automotive’s growth opportunities.\n\nAnalysts Drop Their Rivian Stock Price Targets\n\nIt’s an interesting phenomenon when analysts lower their price targets on a stock but still issue “buy” or “hold”-equivalent ratings on that same stock. Here are some examples for Rivian stock:\n\nStory continues\n\nBarclays analyst Dan Levy: “Overweight” rating but price target lowered from $27 to $25. “We believe the company’s leading EV portfolio and path of improvement make it a structural winner,” Levy remarked. Needham analyst Chris Pierce: “Buy” rating but price target reduced from $25 to $22. According to TheFly, the Needham analysts feel that “used vehicle pricing data and vehicle inventories” support their “confidence in Rivian end demand.” Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner: “Hold” rating and price target cut from $29 to $19. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney: “Neutral” rating and price target lowered from $20 to $17.\n\nIt’s unlikely that these analysts would recommend buy or holding a stock if they hated it. Without a doubt, the analysts have to weigh Rivian Automotive’s challenges, such as the low-demand “EV winter,” against the company’s opportunities, such as Rivian’s upcoming R2 vehicle model production.\n\nHere’s the kicker, though. If you see RIVN stock at $15 or $16, this it’s below all of the aforementioned price targets. To me, this suggests that the market has already priced in all of Rivian Automotive’s challenges and worst-case scenarios. Again, there’s a sense that investors are completely overlooking Rivian’s opportunities to grow and recover in 2024.\n\nRivian Stock Analysis: Buy Low, Don’t Sell High\n\nPeople say that they like to “buy low and sell high.” So, here we are and our RIVN stock analysis reveals a “buy low” scenario that you can take advantage of right now. The Rivian Automotive is already below Wall Street’s forecasts, and the market is evidently baking worst-case scenarios in the pie.\n\nSo, if you’re serious about “buy low, sell high,” then take a look at Rivian stock today. Better yet, grab a handful of Rivian shares while they’re still cheap. And don’t worry about the “sell high” part, as you may decide to put this stock in the “hold forever” category at some point.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Baltimore Orioles sale to Carlyle (CG) co-founder David Rubenstein for $1.725 billion is just about done and dusted.\n\nA source with direct knowledge of the proceedings told Yahoo Finance that Rubenstein — who is from Baltimore and a lifelong Orioles fan — will be the \"control\" owner of the team. An investment consortium consisting of Ares Management co-founder Mike Arougheti and Orioles Hall of Famer Cal Ripken will also be involved.\n\nThe consortium will include other sports stars and celebrities, the source said. Names could not be learned.\n\nThe deal to Rubenstein — who has a net worth of about $3.7 billion — could be formally announced by today's end, the source said. The MLB must still approve the sale from long-time owner the Angelos family.\n\nRubenstein's Orioles purchase is just another feather in the cap of the businessman turned philanthropist and TV interviewer.\n\nIn 1987, Rubenstein co-founded The Carlyle Group alongside William Conway, Stephen Norris, Daniel D’Aniello, and Greg Rosenbaum. Today, the private equity powerhouse boasts more than $382 billion in assets under management across three business segments and 543 investment vehicles.\n\nThe company recently appointed former top Goldman Sachs (GS) exec Harvey Schwartz as CEO.\n\nAlong the way, the former aide to President Jimmy Carter has become a noted philanthropist who signed The Giving Pledge, and a show host who has interviewed the world's top leaders.\n\nOne of those interviews included a 2018 chat with Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos.\n\n“When I interviewed Jeff Bezos, that was pretty good,” Rubenstein recalled in an April 2023 interview with Yahoo Finance. “I've known him for a while and we had a really good rapport.”\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Amazon.com is US$197 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$159 share price, Amazon.com appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for AMZN is US$184 which is 6.7% below our fair value estimate\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$57.7b US$75.7b US$84.7b US$90.2b US$107.7b US$117.0b US$124.8b US$131.5b US$137.3b US$142.4b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x10 Analyst x3 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 8.61% Est @ 6.69% Est @ 5.35% Est @ 4.41% Est @ 3.75% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5%  US$53.7k US$65.5k US$68.2k US$67.6k US$75.1k US$75.8k US$75.3k US$73.8k US$71.7k US$69.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$696b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$142b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$2.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8t÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$1.3t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.0t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$159, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.054. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Should Buy and Keep Forever",
        "content": "Should you hold a stock forever? Some say that investors shouldn't marry their stocks. I'd argue in favor of holding stocks for as long as their underlying businesses perform, which could include forever.\n\nAdmittedly, that sets the bar high. Most companies have occasional bumps and bruises. The good ones bounce back. But business is competitive, and staying atop the mountain for decades is hard.\n\nKeeping that in mind, I set out to build a list of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that could potentially earn a permanent spot in a diversified portfolio. After all, AI is forecast to create trillions of dollars in economic value over the coming decades. That means it should be an excellent spot for long-term thinking.\n\nWhat makes a company (and its stock) likely to last for such a long time? Image source: Getty Images\n\nThe recipe for forever AI stocks\n\nNobody knows what the future will hold. AI could look completely different in a decade than it does now. Looking for future-resistant businesses steered me to look for a few crucial traits. Specifically, investors should take a closer look at companies with:\n\nDominant existing business models Great balance sheets Tremendous cash flows\n\nIn other words, look for situations where AI strengthens an already great company.\n\nWith that said, consider buying and keeping these three AI stocks forever:\n\n1. Nvidia: Dominating the AI chip market\n\nYou've probably seen a ton of coverage on Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and most investors already know about its potential. But Nvidia is too important to leave off this list just because it isn't the new thing. The company rapidly acquired a stranglehold on the AI chip market, and it is arguably the most essential building block of AI because the models that are essential to AI require lots of computing power to crunch data. According to analysts, Nvidia's AI chip market share sits around 90%.\n\nAs a result, business is booming. Top and bottom-line growth rocketed off in 2023, and since the AI chip market is poised to expand tremendously moving forward, this could be the new normal for a while.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhy should investors feel optimistic that Nvidia will keep its market share? The company built an end-to-end hardware and software ecosystem that helps customers using its chips deploy and maximize their AI models. The entire platform is the secret sauce, not just the chips themselves. Are companies building within this ecosystem going to bail and use something else easily? That would be like changing all the electrical wiring in your house. It's a messy job that's probably not appealing to most.\n\n2. A cloud giant distributing AI tools\n\nE-commerce giant and cloud leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for several businesses, so its AI potential might slip under the radar a bit. But that could work in investors' favor. Amazon has already built a trillion-dollar company on e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and streaming. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has blossomed into the world's leader with an estimated 50% market share, according to research by HG Insights.\n\nThat same report estimates roughly 2.38 million businesses use Amazon's cloud computing services, so that is low-hanging fruit to begin cross-selling AI products and services. Cloud computing is already projected to continue growing for years, and weaving AI and machine learning into that business may only pour gas on Amazon's success. AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAdditionally, Amazon's strong presence in e-commerce (38% market share in the U.S.) and rapidly growing advertising business are excellent safety nets for investors. AI can add to a winning business instead of putting Amazon in a make-or-break scenario. That sets a high floor, making Amazon an outstanding stock to buy and tuck away.\n\n3. Ambitious and bold leadership drives this stock\n\nCEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk seemingly likes doing hard stuff. He built a space exploration company and led Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) to disrupt the automotive industry with electric vehicles. Naturally, he wouldn't let the AI technology era arrive without tossing his hat in the ring. Tesla is investing heavily in multiple AI-related products.\n\nTesla's full-self-driving (FSD) ambitions headline this list. The company has been developing FSD software for years that relies on camera imagery to process the vehicle's surroundings. Musk himself has said that Tesla's value depends heavily on succeeding with FSD. Additionally, the company is developing a humanoid robot that will hopefully utilize FSD's tech to perform manual labor someday. Tesla's Dojo supercomputer powers its AI, making the EV company a full-fledged technology powerhouse. TSLA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nFSD and robotics look promising, but ambition doesn't promise success. However, despite Musk's claim, Tesla likely has a bright future, supported by strong leadership in EVs and a growing energy business. Investors can buy into Tesla on that alone, with FSD and AI robotics being potential catalysts for Tesla to realize its full long-term investment potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

According to the company, AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, increasing from 3 percentage points last quarter.\n\n\"We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.”\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft’s market capitalization over $3 trillion.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.\n\nOn the productivity side of things, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes revenue hit $19.25 billion, just ahead of estimates of $19.03 billion. The company’s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, generated $16.89 billion.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images) (Ethan Miller via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft’s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot’s more advanced features.\n\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\n\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and, in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\n\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently, as users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, it’s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it’s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has $177 Billion Invested in These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Here's Which 1 Could Soar the Most in 2024.",
        "content": "You won't find many of the hottest growth stocks on the market in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. His approach focuses more on stocks with attractive valuations and underlying business models that are in his circle of competence.\n\nHowever, I didn't say you won't find any of these sizzling stocks among the legendary investor's holdings. Buffett has $177 billion invested in these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nBuffett's \"Magnificent Two\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven narrows down to the \"Magnificent Two\" as far as Buffett is concerned. It's also probably fair to say that he views one of those two stocks as much more magnificent than the other.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ranks as the biggest position in Berkshire's portfolio by far. The conglomerate's stake is currently worth close to $175.9 billion.\n\nOne of Berkshire's other investment managers first bought 10 million shares of Apple in May 2016. However, it didn't take long for Buffett to jump aboard the Apple train. Buying the stock turned out to be a very good move. Apple's shares have soared more than 8x since Berkshire first purchased the stock, including a gain of more than 30% over the last 12 months.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stands as the only other Magnificent Seven stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. As was the case with Apple, another Berkshire investment manager initiated the position in Amazon. Buffett acknowledged shortly after the purchase of Amazon stock in 2019 that he had \"been an idiot for not buying\" sooner. Berkshire's stake in the e-commerce and cloud services giant is currently worth around $1.6 billion.\n\nEven though Buffett was late to the party with Amazon, he's had plenty to celebrate. Over the last 12 months alone, the stock has skyrocketed nearly 60%.\n\nWhich stock could soar the most in 2024?\n\nA greater percentage of analysts have bullish takes on Amazon than do Apple. I don't always agree with the prevailing view on Wall Street, but in this case, I think that the analysts are probably right.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is a wonderful business. The stickiness of its iPhone ecosystem is truly impressive. However, investors should reasonably expect strong growth from a stock that trades at a forward earnings multiple of 29x. They're not getting it with Apple right now.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon continues to deliver tremendous earnings growth. The company's streamlining efforts are paying off. I predict that we'll see more evidence of this in the coming quarters as Amazon's profitability and free cash flow increase further.\n\nAmazon also has a clear catalyst both over the near term and the long term. The rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, generative AI, should spur more organizations to shift their IT spending to the cloud. As the leader in the cloud services market, Amazon Web Services stands to be a key beneficiary of this trend.\n\nThe U.S. economy appears to be demonstrating more resilience than many expected as well. That bodes well for Amazon's e-commerce business in 2024.\n\nBuffett's secret Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nApple and Amazon are the only Magnificent Seven stocks you'll see listed in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. However, Buffett and Berkshire do own two other members of the group.\n\nBerkshire's subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), has a separate portfolio. Like Berkshire, NEAM has a stake in Apple. It also owns shares of Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nCould either of these other Magnificent Seven stocks ever find their way into Berkshire's portfolio? I think it's possible. Buffett has expressed his admiration for Google and Microsoft in the past. The biggest obstacle, for now, is probably the valuations of the two stocks. It wouldn't be a shock, though, if Buffett (or one of his lieutenants) scooped up Alphabet and/or Microsoft in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Europe is rushing to tighten oversight of AI. The US is taking its time.",
        "content": "The European Union is applying new legal restraints around artificial intelligence this year. The US is still trying to figure out how far it wants to go.\n\nThe European Parliament in December reached a provisional agreement on the world’s first comprehensive legislation to regulate AI, focusing on uses instead of the technology.\n\nThe new rules range in severity depending on how risky the application is, with facial recognition and certain medical innovations requiring approval before being made available to customers.\n\nFederal laws specific to AI don’t exist yet in the US, and it’s unknown whether that will happen. The EU's actions, however, could still have a chilling effect on companies based in this country.\n\n\"Any software- and data-technology-rich issue crosses borders so quickly,\" intellectual property expert Gareth Kristensen, a partner with the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, said.\n\nThe EU is throwing its weight around in other parts of the tech world, too. Just this week, EU opposition to a union of two American tech companies — Amazon (AMZN) and robot vacuum maker iRobot (IRBT) — was enough for the firms to call off their $1.4 billion merger.\n\nNot everyone in the US agrees new laws are needed to oversee AI. To date, Washington's attempts to regulate the industry have proceeded slowly and on parallel tracks at the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\nAn executive order issued by President Biden last October directed AI developers and users to apply AI \"responsibly.\" Just this week, the administration announced new details there, including a new requirement for developers to disclose their safety test results to the government.\n\nOn Capitol Hill meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has overseen a series of roundtables — with figures like Elon Musk and others in attendance — to begin the process of drafting new laws around the topic. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). REUTERS/Anna Rose Layden (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHe will be tasked with merging together a group of bipartisan bills under consideration. That includes one from Democratic Senator Gary Peters, Republican Senators Mike Braun and James Lankford to make it mandatory for US government agencies to disclose when they use AI for human interactions and to set in place an appeals process to allow individuals to object to AI-generated decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn another bill introduced in June, Democratic Senators Michael Bennet and Mark Warner joined Republican Senator Todd Young in proposing an office of global competition analysis that would be tasked with helping the US maintain global leadership in AI.\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal and Republican Senator Josh Hawley also announced their own framework on AI legislation. They proposed that the US establish an independent licensing and oversight organization, along with AI transparency requirements and legal liability for harms caused by the technology.\n\nThere’s no guarantee that any of this new US legislation will come to pass.\n\n\"The US is very free market, and difficult to get bipartisan consensus on a federal level,\" Kristensen said.\n\n'Proactive rather than reactive'\n\nThe US, deliberately, hasn’t gone the way of the EU, said Ryan Abbott, a technology-focused intellectual property attorney and medical doctor. America's comparatively more market-driven, \"less regulation is more\" philosophy, he said, could lead lawmakers to police AI using existing IP, copyright, and trademark laws.\n\n\"There's a whole other view of this, which is that you really don't need something comprehensive because, really, existing rules cover AI regulation,\" Abbot added.\n\nIntellectual property law governs patents, copyrights and trademarks. And tort law protects individuals from harmful products placed into the market.\n\nAbbot, however, recommended in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last June that lawmakers should at least consider amending intellectual property laws so that AI-generated inventions are clearly patentable. Under current US law, only human inventors are eligible to obtain a patent.\n\nMusk — one of the original backers of OpenAI, creator of chatbot ChatGPT — has said that perhaps a new federal department is needed to stay on top of the risks. That’s what he told reporters after meetings on Capitol Hill in September. Elon Musk speaks to reporters as he leaves the 'AI Insight Forum' on Capitol Hill last September. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images) (Nathan Howard via Getty Images)\n\n\"The reason that I've been saying that before, about the whole AI safety in advance of sort of anything terrible happening, is that consequences of AI going wrong are severe. So we have to be proactive rather than reactive,\" Musk said last September.\n\nWhite House national economic advisor Lael Brainard and acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said in a op-ed piece published in Yahoo Finance Tuesday that the Labor Department is creating a set of principles for \"the responsible, worker-centric use of AI\" while the administration prepares \"detailed policy recommendations to protect and support workers against potential AI-related job displacement.\"\n\nA similar approach is unfolding in the United Kingdom. That nation’s government is now advocating for companies to voluntarily comply with key principles that its lawmakers set out in a white paper published last year. The UK is expected, for now, to empower its regulators to apply existing law to AI, and base potential legislation depending on future levels of compliance.\n\nChina has adopted more politically focused AI laws. Those requirements target AI-generated news distribution, deep fakes, chat bots, and datasets. To date, they are much less comprehensive than the EU’s AI Act.\n\nKristensen estimated that the EU's new AI Act is likely to take effect over the next six to 24 months, as members of the 27-nation bloc sign off on the final text.\n\nSome members, including the French government, have been rumored to be exploring whether to revise and push back on certain parts of the act.\n\nWhatever final regulations each government adopts, Abbott said, will play a big role in how AI is developed and used from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n\"There's sort of a perception that there's an AI arms race right now, internationally.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

There are tech stocks that can double from here and reward investors as they continue to expand.\n\nInvestors looking for must-buy tech stocks leading the digital revolution may want to consider these three stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a long history of outperforming the market, and many of its top business segments are still growing. The tech conglomerate jumped up by 13% year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nMicrosoft’s cloud products and services have been surging higher and heavily contributed to the company’s successful quarter. Microsoft is incorporating artificial intelligence into its cloud products to make them more valuable for businesses.\n\nThe company is also investing in quantum computing which can be the next innovative wave of tech. Microsoft has enough capital to get a head start on innovative technology and acquire companies that beat them to it.\n\nMicrosoft stock delivered a 63% gain over the past year. The stock is up by 293% over the past five years. Microsoft’s net profit margins are closing in at 40% and have a 39 P/E ratio. Analysts predict another 10% upside based on the average price target of $442.70.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Automated stock trading concept.

AI Stocks with Potential\n\nSource: Owlie Productions / Shutterstock.com\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) looks ready to mirror Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and deliver robust revenue and earnings growth for several quarters. High growth rates can help the stock march much higher despite its 538% gain over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro is at the center of the artificial intelligence boom with its advanced AI servers and storage solutions. Artificial intelligence is innovative but requires significant computing power to operate smoothly. Supermicro has seen rising demand for its solutions which should continue for a while.\n\nThe company thrived long before artificial intelligence became mainstream. Corporations use Supermicro’s servers for cloud computing, 5G, and other tech. It explains why shares are up by more than 3,000% over the past five years. As good as the company’s 1-year gain has been, it has a proven record of outperformance.\n\nThe profitable company currently trades at a 44 P/E ratio. Supermicro looks poised to ride the AI trend and generate meaningful value for long-term investors.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) Automated stock trading concept.

ServiceNow aims to be the defining enterprise software of the 21st century and has over 8,100 global customers. That customer base includes 85% of the Fortune 500.\n\nServiceNow has tapped into generative AI to create additional value for its customers. This new offering contributed to ServiceNow’s successful quarter and elevated guidance.\n\nRevenue growth remains strong for the company and came in at 25.5% year-over-year in Q4 2023. The firm has a 99% renewal rate among its customers and 1,987 customers with contracts exceeding $1 million in annual revenue. GAAP net income came in at $295 million which represents a 97% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nServiceNow has been an exceptional stock for several years. Shares are up by 74% over the past year and have gained 247% over the past five years. Shares trade at a high 59 forward P/E ratio. However, it’s easier for investors to overlook this valuation if they plan to hold onto this stock for at least five years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, SMCI, and NOW.

        "title": "Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon rank as top 3 most admired companies in the world",
        "content": "Good morning.\n\nReputation matters in business. Just think of what has happened to Boeing, which five years ago ranked in the top 20 of Fortune’s World’s Most Admired all-stars. These days it’s the butt of screw-loose jokes. Meanwhile Nvidia has soared up the list over the last four years, landing at No. 10 in our latest ranking, out this morning. Ask anyone at either company if these reputational changes matter, and they will tell you: They do. Big time.\n\nWhich is why Fortune’s annual World’s Most Admired Companies list deserves some attention. The more than 3,700 executives, directors, and analysts polled in this effort by our partners at Korn Ferry don’t, for the most part, have any special window into what’s going on at these companies. But they do have a good sense of how they are viewed by the people who matter.\n\nSo what can we learn from this year’s list? Well first of all, when it comes to reputation, tech rules. Apple is No. 1, Microsoft No. 2, and Amazon No. 3. But that’s why I think special credit should be given to legacy companies who continue to rank well. Take Walmart, a company that many once thought would be defeated by the ascent of Amazon. Instead, its reputation continues to rise, hitting the No. 9 spot this year, up from 13 last year. (If, like me, you are fascinated by the Walmart-Amazon rivalry, I recommend Fortune reporter Jason Del Rey’s excellent new book Winner Sells All, which you can buy on Walmart.com or Amazon.com—or buy a copy on both and compare the experience!)\n\nSo what else can you learn from this year’s list? Well, kudos to Eli Lilly, which jumped onto the all-star list at No. 34 this year, and ended Johnson & Johnson’s 10-year reign as the most admired pharmaceutical company. And regrets to Disney, which fell to No. 12 from No. 6, and ceded its spot as the most admired entertainment company to Netflix. (Note that the methodology for choosing the top-ranked companies within industries is different than that for choosing all-stars, which is why Netflix still ranks below Disney on the all-star list at No. 23.)\n\nStory continues\n\nCredit also goes to Moderna (No. 37), Mastercard (No. 40), L’Oreal (No. 43), and Adobe (No. 46), which made the top 50 after not being ranked last year. And bye-bye to last year’s winners McDonald’s, Nestle, Unilever, Lockheed Martin, and Charles Schwab, which dropped off the list.\n\nYou can explore the full list here.

        "content": "Photograph: Kevin Britland/Alamy\n\nI ordered a £450 TV from Amazon Marketplace that never arrived. When I complained, I was sent a photo of the package on my front doorstep. This was in spite of the fact that I had requested it be left out of sight at the back. Moreover, the app had given me a delivery date for the following week, so there was no one at home to sign for it. Amazon repeatedly told me that I was not eligible for a refund under the A-to-Z guarantee because I’d reported an “unusually high number” of missing orders. I’ve only ever made two other claims, both for low-value items, over the course of 13 years and hundreds of orders. Amazon’s customer services told me to submit an online appeal, which generated a message directing me to its help pages, which would tell me to contact customer service. I was told customer service had no way of contacting the appeals team. JH, Castlewellan, County Down\n\nThere are undoubtedly customers who abuse the system, but Amazon’s claim that you’ve made an “unusually high number” of claims seems to be a common response when refusing a refund for pricier orders.\n\nOther readers who declare an unblemished shopping record have been told the same thing and Amazon has apologised and refunded them when I have queried the claim.\n\nEssentially, Amazon has a legal responsibility to ensure that you get what you paid for. If it suspects foul play, it needs evidence. I have previously highlighted how customers whose high-end goods disappear have been sent on a wild goose chase via the police, who have no remit over missing deliveries. And how Amazon ignores customers whose items vanish after its delivery verification system is abused or fails.\n\nAmazon predictably told me that your refund claim should have been granted immediately. It said: “Customer satisfaction is our utmost priority, and we’re sorry that customer experience did not meet the high standards we expect. We have apologised and they’ve been refunded in full.”\n\nHelpfully, it added that customers who had a problem with an order from a third-party seller should contact it about a refund under the A-to-Z guarantee. Which is exactly what you did!\n\nPB of Leeds experienced a similar ordeal and emerged victorious and has this advice: “Amazon didn’t follow my instructions to leave my parcels with a neighbour – they were dumped on my doorstep and stolen. Amazon refused a refund, then changed its mind but failed to pay, then blocked my account. I took them to the small claims court, where they admitted liability and paid me back at last!”\n\nEmail your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

        "title": "Alibaba Stock (NYSE:BABA): New Bullish Catalysts Have Emerged",
        "content": "Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), the Chinese tech giant, disappointed investors in 2023 while many of its American counterparts delivered strong returns. Alibaba stock has declined almost 40% in the last 12 months, but new catalysts have emerged to drive the stock higher in 2024. Although regulatory risks need to be monitored carefully, I am bullish on Alibaba stock.\n\nSoftBank Finally Completes Divesting Alibaba\n\nSoftBank (OTC:SFTBF), the Japanese investment firm led by billionaire Masayoshi Son, was one of the first institutional investors to believe in Alibaba. The investment firm invested $20 million in Alibaba in 2000. In late 2021, SoftBank entered into a forward contract with its subsidiary Skybridge to divest its Alibaba stake. This contract allowed SoftBank to repurchase Alibaba shares from Skybridge if needed.\n\nOn January 25, SoftBank announced the settlement of these prepaid forward contracts with Skybridge, reportedly booking a profit of around $8.5 billion from its investment in Alibaba. The investment firm has decided not to purchase or sell any new Alibaba shares in the foreseeable future. The firm currently owns a minor stake in Alibaba of approximately 0.5%, in contrast to an ownership stake of 32% back in 2021.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the massive selling pressure created by SoftBank over the last couple of years acted as a barrier for Alibaba stock to trend higher despite the company spending massive amounts on share buybacks. For reference, the company spent $10.2 billion on stock repurchases in the last 12 months.\n\nGoing forward, it seems reasonable to assume that buybacks will finally create a positive impact, assuming the company continues to perform well financially.\n\nThe Founder and President Are Betting on Alibaba\n\nOn January 23, SEC filings revealed that Alibaba founder Jack Ma and current Chairman Joe Tsai both purchased company shares, indicating their improving sentiment toward the company’s prospects at a time when SoftBank is exiting its investment. Mr. Ma purchased Alibaba shares worth $50 million, while Mr. Tsai invested $151 million in the company through his family investment fund.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing these transactions, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai became the two largest shareholders of the company, ending SoftBank’s reign that spanned several years. The founding members’ return as largest shareholders is likely to boost investor sentiment in the coming months, which was evident from the initial market reaction on January 23, when Alibaba stock jumped more than 7% following the release of SEC filings highlighting these transactions.\n\nAlibaba Enjoys a Long Runway to Grow\n\nAlibaba’s investment appeal stems from two factors: the long growth runway enjoyed by the company and its cheap valuation.\n\nAlibaba has emerged as a leader in the cloud computing space in China, which is a market that is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years, with companies of all scales and sizes moving to the cloud. According to Canalys data, Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the cloud market in China at the end of Q1 2023, with Huawei Cloud in second place with a market share of 20%.\n\nAccording to Statista, revenue in the Chinese public cloud sector will grow at a CAGR of 18.7% through 2028, resulting in a market value of $137 billion at the end of the forecast period. The ongoing integration of AI capabilities in the cloud market will be one of the key growth drivers in the next five years.\n\nAlibaba enjoys quantifiable pricing power in this market segment, and the company has reported consistently higher renewal rates compared to many of its peers. These observations suggest that Alibaba is well-positioned to make the most of the expected growth in the cloud market.\n\nThe company is integrating AI into its digital retail technologies, including the development of unified core technology and solving language translation challenges. In the digital media entertainment segment, the company is using AI to create next-generation content and to achieve process-based digitalized film and TV show production capabilities.\n\nAlthough a full business separation may not be in the cards anymore, Alibaba continues to find ways to manage its business units independently, which should enable the company to unlock hidden value in the coming years. This will be another growth driver.\n\nAt a more granular level, the company has come up with ambitious visions for each of its key business segments. Examples include 1688 aiming to leverage products manufactured in China with business customers in mind, Xianyu seeking to become a lifestyle platform without limiting itself to secondhand goods, DingTalk aiming to become the best AI smart assistant system in China, Quark targeting students to sell its knowledge products, and Youku committing to prioritize self-produced content to compete in the video content niche.\n\nIs Alibaba Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nBased on the ratings of 20 Wall Street analysts, BABA stock comes in as a Strong Buy. The average Alibaba stock price target is $118.20, which implies upside potential of 63.4% from the current market price.\n\nAlibaba is trading at a meaningful discount to its historical valuation multiples and also compared to its American counterparts. The company is valued at a forward P/E of 8.2 compared to its five-year average forward P/E of 18.15. To add more context, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at a forward P/E of 59.4.\n\nAlibaba’s cheap valuation has attracted many Wall Street bulls in recent months, but its stock has not performed up to expectations due to investor worries about Chinese regulators and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nThe Takeaway: Alibaba Stock Is Closer to Turning a Corner\n\nAlibaba has remained cheaply valued for about two years. Today, new catalysts have emerged to drive the stock higher in the form of SoftBank completing its planned divestment of Alibaba shares and the improving regulatory improvement. The company seems attractively valued for long-term-oriented investors at a time when tables are turning in favor of the company both from a regulatory and financial performance perspective.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Fed decision ahead; Microsoft, Alphabet's AI costs - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures are mixed as investors await a major Federal Reserve interest rate decision and potential commentary on future borrowing costs from the central bank. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) warn that spending on developing their artificial intelligence capabilities will be higher this year, offsetting a strong set of quarterly earnings from the tech giants. Elsewhere, Elon Musk's massive Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pay package worth nearly $56 billion is voided by a Delaware judge.\n\n1. Fed decision ahead\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely tipped to keep interest rates steady following the central bank's latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, meaning any comments from officials around the path ahead for interest rates will be in sharp focus.\n\nBorrowing costs currently stand at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in more than two decades, after the Fed embarked on an aggressive campaign of rate hikes aimed at cooling elevated U.S. inflation.\n\nRecent data has suggested that this tightening cycle may be having the desired effect. While price growth remains above the Fed's stated 2% target, it has continued to show signs of easing back down to this mark. Economic activity has also been resilient, a trend most recently evidenced by a stronger-than-projected advance reading of fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product last week.\n\nThe figures have bolstered hopes that the Fed may be able to defeat inflation without sparking a broader economic meltdown -- a scenario known as a \"soft landing.\"\n\nPolicymakers signaled in December that there could be as many as six rate reductions in 2024, fueling anticipation late last year that a twenty five basis point cut could come as early as March. Yet several Fed officials, wary of reigniting upward pressure on inflation, have since poured cold water on these expectations. Commentary today from the Fed -- and Chair Jerome Powell in particular -- could thus impact how markets see rates evolving in the coming months.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading on both sides of the flatline, as investors looked ahead to the Fed decision and gauged a fresh slate of major corporate earnings.\n\nBy 05:26 ET (10:26 GMT), the Dow futures contract had added 34 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures had dipped by 27 points or 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures had shed 224 points or 1.3%.\n\nThe Fed could finally \"put a pin in the idea\" of an imminent rate cut on Wednesday, said Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analysts at CMC Markets (LON:CMCX), in a note. \"It would be surprising if the Fed were to signal a cut in rates in March although they might well open the door to one on [the second quarter],\" Hewson added.\n\nElsewhere, shares in Microsoft and Alphabet slipped in premarket trading, with Wall Street fretting over the large costs both of the tech behemoths are set to incur in their push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence (more below). More earnings are due out today, including numbers from embattled planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO).\n\nIn the prior session, the benchmark S&P 500 closed lower by 0.1%, but was still just under its all-time high reached on Monday, while a dip in megacap names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dragged down the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite by 0.8%. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%.\n\n3. Microsoft, Alphabet flag AI costs\n\nMicrosoft and Google-owner Alphabet have flagged that they expect capital spending will rise this year as they attempt to bolster their position in the intensifying race to harness surging demand for generative AI.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft told analysts in a post-earnings call that the need to scale its AI infrastructure would cause expenditures to \"increase materially\" on a sequential basis in areas like data centers and servers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood added that Microsoft, who surpassed Apple has the world's biggest company earlier this month, is shifting to an \"AI-first position.\"\n\nAlphabet also said that spending would be \"notably larger\" in 2024, with the YouTube-parent driving to build out its AI offerings at its key advertising and cloud services units. In particular, Alphabet is targeting the launch of an advanced upgrade to its generative AI chatbot, Bard, later this year.\n\nFinance chief Ruth Porat noted that the group sees \"extraordinary\" potential for the applications of AI for users, adding that the technology offers \"long-term growth opportunities.\"\n\nBoth firms posted better-than-anticipated profit and revenues in their most recent quarters, although Wall Street's tepid reaction indicated that doubts remain over whether they can maintain the soaring spending levels needed to deliver generative AI.\n\n\"In the larger picture, the trend for this earnings season is clear: the market wants to see who has enough spending power to dominate the innovation war expected to play out as soon as monetary conditions improve,\" said Thomas Monteiro, Senior Analyst at Investing.com. \"In this case, more than actual [earnings per share], investors want to see improving margins and free cash flows so they can understand that the company will have a shot in the AI arms race.\"\n\n4. Judge tosses out Musk's massive Tesla pay package\n\nA judge in the U.S. state of Delaware has voided tech tycoon's Elon Musk's huge $55.8 billion Tesla pay package, saying that it amounted to an \"unfathomable sum\" that was not fair to shareholders.\n\nThe decision, which tosses out the biggest remuneration offering in corporate America, argued that the directors of the electric vehicle giant appeared to be beholden to Musk's \"superstar appeal.\" The case related to a lawsuit brought by some Tesla stakeholders who believed that the compensation was excessive.\n\nShould the ruling be upheld, Musk would lose options to more than 303 million Tesla shares, or roughly about 10% of the company and well below his previously stated goal of 25% ownership.\n\nShares in Tesla slipped in premarket trading on Wednesday.\n\n5. Crude dips after weak Chinese manufacturing data\n\nOil prices edged lower, as disappointing manufacturing activity data from China, the world's biggest crude importer, dented sentiment.\n\nBy 05:27 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $76.89 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 1.1% to $81.59 a barrel.\n\nOfficial data showed that manufacturing activity in China contracted for a fourth straight month in January, raising further doubts around the strength of the economic recovery of this vital crude market.\n\nThat said, the crude benchmarks are still on course for their first monthly gain since September as broadening Middle East conflicts exacerbated supply concerns over this oil-rich region.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated that crude stockpiles dropped by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 26.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "content": "In this article, we look at the 30 most air polluted cities in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on companies that are taking measures to combat pollution and head over directly to the 10 Most Air Polluted Cities In The World.\n\nA report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in March 2023 highlighted that global carbon emissions reached an all-time high of 36.8 Gt in 2022 – having increased 0.9% compared to the previous year. Vehicle emissions, smoke from manufacturing in factories, chemical production, coal power plants, and the use of natural gas to provide heating at homes are the primary sources of pollution and trigger global warming, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n\nA study by Climate Central in September last year found that 98% of the world’s population was exposed to global warming and experienced hotter temperatures between June and September 2023 due to carbon dioxide pollution.\n\nSeveral notable corporations have committed themselves to tackling air pollutants over the last few years. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been scaling investments in carbon removal technologies (CDR). In May last year, the company announced that it had signed two separate agreements worth over $200 million with Climeworks and CO280 Solutions, Inc. to purchase CDRs, which JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) expects to remove and store 800,000 metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nThe investment is part of the company’s sustainable development targets announced in 2021, which includes spending up to $2.5 trillion by 2030 to address climate change, and $1 trillion for green initiatives. These measures have received acclaim from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s investors. ClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\nIn addition to business models that support biodiversity, it is also important to provide financing for efforts to improve biodiversity. Large financial firms such as ClearBridge holding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have a key role here through green bond underwritings that support natural capital protection. In 2021 JPM announced a target to finance and facilitate $1 trillion toward green initiatives by 2030 as part of its broader $2.5 trillion sustainable development target. The green initiatives include biodiversity-linked areas such as water management, circular economy and waste management, in addition to conservation and biodiversity, which focuses on improving terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity ecosystems or forests.\n\nAs part of this target, in 2022 JPM served as the lead underwriter for a $350 million green bond issued by The Nature Conservancy, the largest green bond issuance by a conservation nonprofit ever. The issuance is expected to help The Nature Conservancy avoid or sequester 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), and conserve 650 million hectares of healthy land, 30 million hectares of freshwater and 4 billion hectares of oceans.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has also announced investments in direct air capture (DAC) technology to clean the atmosphere from emissions. In September 2023, the company said it was going to purchase 250,000 tonnes of removal credits from 1PointFive over a period of 10 years, which is about the same amount of carbon that is stored across at least 290,000 acres of forest land across the United States. The move is part of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s goal of net zero emissions by 2040. According to a report in Reuters, carbon removal credits per metric tonne can cost in the range of mid-to-high-triple digits.\n\nIn addition to this, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making an investment in CarbonCapture, another prominent climate technology company that is known for its DAC systems. The financial aspects of the deal are not known. In return, CarbonCapture will be providing Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) 100,000 tonnes of removal credits, which the company plans on making available for its partner, customers, and suppliers as well along with its own business units.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also announced in 2020 to purchase sustainable aviation fuel credits from SkyNRG and supply them to Alaska Airlines to operate flights between Seattle – 15 miles from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s head office in Redmond – and San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Jose. The reasoning behind the company’s decision is the hope that this would help in reducing pollution caused by commercial flights taken by its employees. A year earlier, the company’s fact sheet showed that travel made up 3% of all carbon emissions made by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2019. 30 Most Air Polluted Cities In The World\n\nJorg Hackemann/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 30 most air polluted cities in the world are ranked in ascending order of their Air Quality Index (AQI) scores based on live-time data being updated on IQAir.

Over the last few years, the city has taken strides in improving air quality, but still much needs to be done. Guangzhou is home to over 25 million with large economic activity which triggers pollution.\n\n26. Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nAQI US: 129\n\nCities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are plagued with air pollution due to the country’s dependency on coal for internal heating and electricity generation. Its capital, Sarajevo, is one of the most air polluted cities in the world.\n\n25. Hanoi, Vietnam\n\nAQI US: 133\n\nHanoi’s air quality fluctuates between 101-200 on a regular basis, from being unhealthy for sensitive groups to unhealthy for everyone. According to IQAir, 500 tonnes of charcoal and 700 tonnes of waste are burnt every day in the Vietnamese capital which is a primary source of the pollution there.\n\n24. Kraków, Poland\n\nAQI US: 135\n\nKraków is among the most polluted cities in Europe. The Polish government has been actively working to improve air quality by delivering financial assistance to citizens to change their home heating systems, but a lot of more work still needs to be done.\n\n23. Karachi, Pakistan\n\nAQI US: 137\n\nTransport and industrial emissions are the major causes of pollution in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi. On December 4, it was ranked as the most polluted city in the world by IQAir with the AQI recorded at 244.\n\n22.

Kaohsiung, Taiwan\n\nAQI US: 153\n\nKaohsiung is one of the most polluted cities in the worldfor air quality. To combat the challenge, Taiwan’s government in 2019 announced to replace all coal power plants at the Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung with natural gas-powered units by 2025.\n\n19. Belgrade, Serbia\n\nAQI US: 155\n\nBelgrade in Serbia is home to five of the fifteen most polluted districts in Europe, according to a report in The Guardian.

Kathmandu, Nepal\n\nAQI US: 155\n\nThe air quality in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu is unhealthy for all residents living in the city, with an AQI score of 155 and a PM2.5 concentration of 71.2µg/m³ – 14 times higher than WHO’s standards.\n\n17. Chongqing, China\n\nAQI US: 156\n\nChongqing, located in southwestern China, is among the most air-polluted cities in the world, with a PM2.5 concentration of 65µg/m³ and PM10 concentration of 102µg/m³ according to IQAir.\n\n16. Beijing, China\n\nAQI US: 157\n\nNext on the list is China’s capital, Beijing, where air pollution is primarily caused by the use of coal to produce electricity, and emissions from manufacturing at factories and old vehicles.\n\n15. Baghdad, Iraq\n\nAQI US: 159\n\nMilitary conflicts in Iraq are one of the reasons for air pollution in Baghdad. With wars destroying much of the country’s energy infrastructure, 30% of its electricity now comes from private diesel generators.\n\n14. Chengdu, China\n\nAQI US: 161\n\nThe air pollution levels in Chengdu are unhealthy for people of all age groups, according to IQAir.

The city has a PM2.5 concentration of 75µg/m³ and PM10 concentration of 86µg/m³.\n\n12. Hangzhou, China\n\nAQI US: 163\n\nHangzhou is one of the most air polluted cities in the world due to a large population of over 10.6 million people who commute daily for work, resulting in increased carbon emissions.\n\n11. Kabul, Afghanistan\n\nAQI US: 166\n\nKabul’s air quality is unhealthy, according to IQAir.

        "title": "The 3 EV Stocks Most Likely to Outrun Tesla",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is well known as the reigning king among EV stocks. The company has blazed a path forward in an industry that really didn’t exist in the same way a decade ago. Accordingly, for most investors, Tesla is the EV sector, and it’s the only stock that matters.\n\nThe market appears to be disagreeing lately, with Tesla seeing a major slide on a year-to-date basis alone. At the time of writing, TSLA stock is down 25% in 2024 alone, much of this driven by the company’s recent earnings results (which underwhelmed, to put it nicely).\n\nMany in the EV space are now looking for alternatives. As a global game, and given Tesla’s current dominance in the North American market, I think we need to look around the world for some picks. Here are three companies I think have what it takes to eat into Tesla’s global market share over time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD Co. (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn December, China-based BYD Co’s (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) global deliveries numbers skyrocketed to 36,095 units, representing a 209% increase from the previous year. This impressive rise is expected to continue. In January, BYD started auto shipments through its very first PTCT vessel, with a new Thailand-based factory awaiting to begin operations. In late 2023, a price war escalated, prompting BYD and other Chinese EV makers to slash prices and offer discounts. As a result, by the first half of 2023, BYD became the largest automaker in China and the 10th in the world.\n\nTesla exceeded expectations by delivering 484,507 EVs in Q4 and consequently achieved 1.81 million in annual deliveries for 2023. BYD said, “not bad,” delivering more than 3 million vehicles and overtaking Tesla as the global BEV sales leader in Q4 with deliveries of 526,409 units. It is an outstanding feat made possible through the contributions and several brand segments.\n\nTirelessly innovating, BYD is looking to dominate the EV sector in Israel and just set its eyes on Europe and Latin America. Atto 3, Dolphin and Seal are parts of a strong export strategy, but I expect newer models to roll out in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian (RIVN) A new Rivian R1T truck is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, (RIVN) is an electric vehicle automaker. RIVN stock price predictions\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN), a stand-out among EV startups, has managed to swerve away from a head-on collission with Tesla. Instead of competing in the same product categories, Rivian has chosen to focus on pickup trucks and SUVs, areas of the EV market where Tesla is not currently dominant. (In the views of many the Cybertruck really isn’t a pickup in the same way the Model Y isn’t really the three-row-type SUV that was promised.)\n\nRivian’s initial surge upon going public was tied to the company’s links to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon has backed Rivian from the beginning, also providing the company with a hefty order for its delivery vans (yet another niche segment Rivian is after).\n\nWith e-commerce sales steadily rising, it’s no surprise to see delivery vans take center stage as a key growth area of focus for Rivian and others. Amazon already has around 10,000 Rivian delivery vans on the road, and is aggressively pursuing electrification. This is a narrative I don’t hear much about, but it’s pretty central to the Rivian thesis over the long term.\n\nI do think Rivian is likely among the higher-risk, higher-upside picks in the U.S. EV space. However, this is a company backed by a major company looking to reduce its cash burn and ramp up production. If investors can see a path to profitability, this is a stock that could soar.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car retail store with customers. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has risen above the chaos of the volatile EV market, and become a front-runner in the Chinese EV space.  Despite depressed stock as a result of market sentiment, optimistic analysts estimate a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20x for the company. Li’s delivery growth was impressive in 2023, with more than 376,000 vehicles delivered, showcasing growth of more than 180%. Continued growth is expected, with the lacuna of the Li MEGA model in March.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Li Auto revealed updates of its L-series (L7, L8, L9) in 2024. These models are planned to be released in March, and have been offered at a discount through a lunar New Year promotion. The L-series has a large user base, proven by over 420,000 combined sales and over 50,000 monthly sales. Thus, we’ll have to see how this sales push turns out for the company.\n\nOverall, Li is among the top high-growth EV stocks in a still-growing market in China. Those betting on the global rise of EVs, and who think the Chinese market will be the place to be for the coming decades, may want to consider LI stock at these relatively attractive levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) announced its second quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion, beating expectations of adjusted EPS of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion.\n\nShares of the company were off 1% following the announcement.\n\nMicrosoft's all-important cloud revenue topped out at $33.7 billion, beating estimates if $32.2 billion. The company's Intelligent Cloud business, which includes its Azure service, came in at $25.8 billion versus expectations of $25.3 billion. According to the company, AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, increasing from 3 percentage points last quarter.\n\n\"We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.”\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft’s market capitalization over $3 trillion.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.\n\nOn the productivity side of things, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes revenue should hit $19.25 billion, just ahead of estimates of $19.03 billion. The company’s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, generated $16.89 billion. Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella during a press event at CES 2024. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) (Ethan Miller via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft’s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot’s more advanced features.\n\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year, as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\n\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and, in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\n\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently, as users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, it’s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it’s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Amazon Prime is now charging you if you want to avoid commercials on its streaming service",
        "content": "Amazon spends billions of dollars every year on programming for its Prime Video platform, and now it wants customers to pay up or get used to seeing ads on their favorite shows.\n\nOn Monday, the tech giant made ad-supported streaming the default on Prime Video for its more than 200 million subscribers. The company originally announced the plan in September, saying that ​​it was needed, “to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment.”\n\nAmazon claimed in its original announcement that Prime Video will show fewer ads than regular TV or other streaming services, but those who want to avoid them altogether will have to pay an additional $2.99 per month on top of the $14.99 monthly fee that already exists.\n\nThe change comes as the company has increased the amount it spends on content to fill out its Prime offerings. In 2022, the company finalized founder Jeff Bezos's $8.5 billion purchase of MGM, in what was its second-most expensive acquisition at the time. Since then, Amazon has beefed up spending, including a $16 billion splurge on content in 2022, $7 billion of which went to original programming.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the company’s most recent earnings report, Amazon made just over $10 billion from its subscription services unit, which includes Prime and other non-Amazon Web Services subscription services in digital video, audiobooks, digital music, and e-books. Experts predict that the new changes to Prime Video could provide an added boost.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley predict that the company’s changes could bring in an extra $3.3 billion in advertising revenue in 2024. Meanwhile, New York–based media investment firm MoffettNathanson had lower predictions but still said Amazon will bring in $1.3 billion from advertisers in 2024 and another $2.3 billion next year.\n\nThe company is predicting that 159 million of its subscribers will immediately be exposed to ads on the platform, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an internal presentation Amazon made for potential advertisers. That number may be enticing to companies looking to reach more eyeballs, as it beats out the 23 million monthly active users that are exposed to ads on market leader Netflix’s platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Prime customers are mostly unhappy about the change and have taken to social media to complain about the new ads on the platform. Many have chalked up Prime’s ads rollout to corporate greed.\n\nPrime video now has ads???@amazon@PrimeVideo why are you so greedy? #cancelprimepic.twitter.com/FjtKDGwnTS\n\n— Ray Meyer (@rmeyer1126) January 30, 2024\n\nI'm disappointed to hear that Amazon Prime Video is introducing ads. It's a paid subscription service, and I expect an ad-free experience. This move may push users to explore other platforms.\n\n— mariana velaz (@maribella343) January 26, 2024\n\nAlthough customers are not happy with the new change, Wall Street’s push for profitability in streaming has caused companies to adapt their earlier business models. In December 2022, Disney+ introduced an ad-supported tier at the same time that it announced a $3 monthly price hike for its ad-free plan. It then hiked prices another $3 per month in August.\n\nNetflix, which at 260 million subscribers worldwide has more than double the customers of any other streaming service, cracked down on password sharing, along with debuting its own advertising tier, in a bid to improve profitability. These helped Netflix, which is emerging as the undisputed winner of the streaming wars, crush its last earnings with the biggest boost of new subscribers since the pandemic. Of course, Netflix kicked off streaming's pivot from growth to profitability by reporting a subscriber drop in 2022, contributing to the flood of advertising into streaming, now including Amazon Prime.\n\nWhile the percentage of U.S. households that subscribe to streaming services had stayed between 80% and 83% each quarter for the past two years, the end of 2023 saw that number jump to 85%, exceeding expectations and spurring hopes that there is still more room to grow in the streaming sector.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Logistics, delivery heft could help Amazon margins, profitability",
        "content": "By Arriana McLymore\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Whether Amazon.com can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its \"Buy With Prime\" service after a 2022 overhaul of its logistics network will be a big focus for investors when the e-commerce giant reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nAmazon's 200 million Prime members pay $14.99 per month or $139 annually for free shipping in a day or two, and with Buy With Prime, launched in April 2022, merchants can extend the shipping offer to those Prime customers.\n\nThe strategy is simple: use its existing infrastructure to handle packages and orders that aren't placed on Amazon itself in order to generate additional fee revenue for its seller services, which is a high-margin business.\n\nAmazon collects 3% service fees on each Buy With Prime order, with additional payments for fulfillment and payment processing.\n\nAmazon is expected to report a fourth-quarter profit of $29.3 billion, an increase of 34.41% from $21.79 billion in last year's quarter, according to estimates from LSEG.\n\nThe Seattle-based e-commerce giant's margins are expected to be 17.62% compared to last year's 14.60%, according to estimates from LSEG.\n\nAmazon hasn't disclosed how many merchants are using Buy With Prime, and the company declined to comment on the number of those vendors.\n\nSince its roll-out, Amazon has partnered with Shopify and Salesforce, both of which enable sellers to set up e-stores, to offer Buy With Prime to more than 2 million merchants while giving online sellers access to the 200 million Prime subscribers.\n\nBuy With Prime's business model is a \"win win\" for Amazon, outside merchants and Prime members, said Arun Sundaram, vice president of equity research at CFRA Research.\n\n\"Customers get fast delivery, Amazon gets these high-margin fees from the merchants and merchants get more traction onto their websites,\" Sundaram said.\n\nJim Tierney, chief investment officer of Concentrated U.S. Growth at AllianceBernstein, said that a \"huge discovery\" for his firm was the potential for Amazon to lower its costs and boost fee revenues after restructuring its fulfillment network to increase delivery speeds. AllianceBernstein currently holds 0.48% of Amazon's outstanding shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nTierney said he expects Buy With Prime to \"further improve network utilization, thereby providing a boost to margins.\"\n\n\"It also gets a broader group of merchants inside the Amazon ecosystem, which likely expands the moat around Amazon’s business,\" Tierney said.\n\n(This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of AllianceBernstein in paragraph 11)\n\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City; Editing by Mark Porter)",

Baillie Gifford Bolsters Stake in Nanobiotix SA\n\nNanobiotix SA: Pioneering Nanotechnology in Cancer Treatment\n\nNanobiotix SA, listed under the stock symbol NBTX and headquartered in France, made its public debut on December 11, 2020. The company is dedicated to revolutionizing cancer treatment by enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy. Its flagship product candidate, NBTXR3, is designed to amplify the impact of radiotherapy on tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues.

Despite the recent uptick, the stock is currently labeled as a \"Possible Value Trap\" by GuruFocus, urging investors to think twice before investing. The GF Value of the stock stands at $4,267.07, but with a current stock price of $8.18, the price to GF Value ratio is not applicable, indicating that the company may not be undervalued. The GF Score of Nanobiotix SA is 48/100, suggesting poor future performance potential.\n\nStrategic Alignment with Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s Investment Philosophy\n\nThe addition of Nanobiotix SA to Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio aligns with the firm's strategy of investing in companies with the potential for sustainable, long-term growth.

The firm's decision to increase its stake in Nanobiotix may signal confidence in the company's innovative approach to cancer treatment and its growth prospects.\n\nAssessing the Impact of Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s Trade\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent acquisition of additional shares in Nanobiotix SA could have several implications for its portfolio. Although the trade represents a small fraction of the firm's total investments, it may indicate a strategic move to capitalize on the potential upside of Nanobiotix's innovative cancer treatment solutions. The timing of the trade, amidst a recovering stock price, could also suggest that Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) sees a favorable risk-reward scenario unfolding for Nanobiotix.\n\nFinancial Health and Future Prospects of Nanobiotix SA\n\nNanobiotix SA's financial health, as indicated by its Financial Strength and Profitability Ranks, presents a mixed picture. The company's balance sheet receives a moderate score of 5/10, while its profitability and growth ranks are currently at 0/10, reflecting challenges in these areas. The GF Value Rank is also low at 2/10, suggesting that the stock may not be undervalued relative to its intrinsic value. However, with a Momentum Rank of 6/10, there could be short-term trading opportunities based on recent price movements.\n\nConclusion: Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s Calculated Bet on Nanobiotix SA\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s increased stake in Nanobiotix SA is a noteworthy development for investors tracking the firm's moves. While the trade's impact on the overall portfolio is minimal, it underscores Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s confidence in Nanobiotix's potential to disrupt the cancer treatment landscape.

Today, Worksport announced it will be expanding its B2B dealer network in the U.S. and Canada which means revolutionary products with which Worksport promises to disrupt the definition of pickup trucks will be available on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) marketplaces. The EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is also not showing any signs of slowing down despite acknowledging challenges on the way.\n\nWorksport Is Aiming To Establish Itself As A Key Player In The Pickup Market, So Being Present On Amazon And Walmart Is The Logical Step\n\nLast week, Worksport launched its first tonneau cover of its ‘made-in-the- USA’ AL3 PRO hard-folding tonneau cover that promises to redefine standards in pickup truck accessories. Its tonneau covers will be compatible with a wide range of popular truck models, including Ford and its star F series, as well as RAM and Jeep by Stellantis (NYSE: STLA), General Motors (NYSE: GM) brands GMC and Chevrolet, Nissan Motor Co Ltd (OTC: NSANY), and ToyotaMotor (NYSE: TM) light trucks. Worksport plans to strategically expand its market reach and extend its compatibility to also include the Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: HMC) Ridgeline. Durable, functional and stylish, this new product is proudly made in the USA with more than 90% domestically sourced components, the AL3 cover is now available on the Worksport e-commerce site and it is on its way to Amazon, eBay, and Walmart through the company’s rapidly exchanging network.\n\nWorksport plans to kick off sales efforts in early February with first client meetings as it runs to catch its estimated $3 billion tonneau cover market with approximately 60 million pickup trucks already on the roads.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, GM And Ford Are Scaling Back Their EV Plans\n\nBack in October, General Motors postponed the opening of its $4 billion electric truck plant in Michigan for a year. In December, Ford told suppliers that it planned to produce about 1,600 F-150 Lightning EV trucks per week as ofJanuary, roughly half of the 3,200 it previously had planned. Back in August, Ford had said the plant that builds F-150 Lightning reach an annual production rate of 150,000 vehicles by October after saying in 2022 it would double EV truck production. But on Friday, it shifted back to gas-powered vehicles by revealing it will cut the factory’s workforce from two shifts two one and reallocate about two thirds of workers mostly to factories that produce gas-powered Bronco SUVs and Ranger pickups. Moreover, Ford delivered the news of F-150 production cuts while Detroit automakers expressed their discontent with the Biden Administration’s proposals to use emissions rules that would result in 67% of all new vehicles in 2032 being EVs. Ford is still guiding for continued growth in global EV sales this year, but still sees it being less than anticipated.\n\nBut Stellantis Is Not Slowing Down\n\nAlso on Friday, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares informed reporters that the automaker has no plans to slow down its EV production. However, Tavares did acknowledge that this year’s US and European presidential elections could change the pace of EV adoption, and although the slowdown is one of the two scenarios, there’s no stopping due to global warming. Later this year, Stellantis will be putting its ram 1500 Rev and its plug-in hybrid peer Ram 1500 Ramcharger on sale.\n\nTesla Is Also Not Showing Any Signs Of Stopping Despite Challenges\n\nWhile admitting it is a challenging journey, Tesla is doing its best to ramp up production of its Cybertruck at its Austin, Texas factory. Moreover, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed on a post-earnings call on that the EV king expects to start production of its next-generation mass market EV at this factory during the second half of 2025, which will be followed by its facility in Mexico and another factory outside North America which will be decided upon later this year.\n\nWith Tesla continuing to cut vehicle prices in Europe and China, eliminating the obstacle of higher prices and with innovative players like Worksports, addressing driving range anxiety and concerns over charger availability, the EV evolution is undoubtedly advancing in the right direction. With Worksport’s news, even e-commerce titans Amazon and Walmart are making their footprint in the EV universe that is unquestionably the future in the making. As Stellantis CEO noted, when it comes to EVs, the only options are going faster or slower, but either way, there’s no stopping.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The trend is expected to have continued in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAWS’ revenues were $23.06 billion, accounting for 12.3% of net sales in third-quarter 2023, rising 16.1% year over year. We further note that its operating income was $6.98 billion, up 29.1% year over year.\r\n\r\nAn expanding customer base and a strong discount offering for long-term deals are likely to have driven AWS’ top line in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2023 AWS net sales is pegged at $24.32 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nClick here to know how the company’s overall fourth-quarter results are likely to be.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe strengthening cloud services portfolio on the back of generative AI technology and expanding data center networks are likely to have benefited the performance of AWS during the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of AWS regions and availability zones might have remained a positive. In the quarter under review, AWS launched its second infrastructure region in Canada, located in Calgary.\r\n\r\nAll these factors are expected to have aided Amazon in sustaining momentum among existing cloud customers and attracting new ones.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, Trip.com TCOM selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider. Trip.com is leveraging AWS’ robust infrastructure and cloud services to support its global expansion and deliver an enhanced travel experience by offering cost-effective travel booking services and hassle-free on-the-go customer service support.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Hyundai, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, SCAYLE and BYD selected AWS as the preferred cloud provider.\r\n\r\nAWS was also picked by Axiata Group Berhad as the primary cloud provider.\r\n\r\nAerodyne, a drone solution provider, went all-in on AWS to solve complex industrial issues with drone data.\r\n\r\nCathay selected AWS as its strategic cloud partner to establish the Cathay Machine Learning Innovation Hub.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited (Krungsri) also picked AWS to boost its digital transformation and accelerate the financial inclusion drive in Thailand.\r\n\r\nApart from these, Amgen AMGN partnered with AWS to expand the usage of the latter’s cloud solutions. Amgen is developing generative AI-based solutions to accelerate advanced therapies and boost the manufacturing throughput of medicines on the back of AWS’ robust generative AI and Machine Learning capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe note that the strengthening customer base is likely to have driven AWS's top-line growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Another Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nAnother top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Arista Networks ANET, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "title": "Buffett Bot’s Best Bets: 3 Top Stock Picks From a Warren-Trained AI Model",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is often hailed as one of the greatest investors, with a track record that has consistently outpaced the broader markets. Could artificial intelligence (AI) emulate his success? I recently discovered an intriguing AI model called the “Buffett Bot” that was trained to mimic Warren Buffett.\n\nAs AI continues making strides across industries, it’s no surprise some clever developers have aimed these analytical engines at the financial markets. And basing one on the Oracle of Omaha himself seems like an especially smart play. Of course, this AI isn’t the real Buffett, but it offers a fascinating glimpse into how modern data science attempts to replicate legendary investors.\n\nI’ll be taking a look at the stock picks recently put forward by this Buffett-inspired AI. The model imitates Buffett’s penchant for finding strong yet reasonably-valued businesses. It will be intriguing to see what kind of companies and sectors the Buffett Bot highlights as solid investments. While this AI is unlikely to fully capture the depth of real-world experience and nuanced judgment behind Buffett’s brilliance, it may still surface some appealing prospects. At the very least, its selections should provide thoughtful food for thought.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoody’s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoody’s (NYSE:MCO) holds an enormously influential position in global finance as one of the “Big Three” credit ratings agencies alongside S&P (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch. This oligopoly enjoys durable competitive advantages from high barriers to entry and a sticky customer base. Thus, I’m not surprised to see Buffett Bot tap Moody’s as a smart Buffett-style bet.\n\nAfter all, the real Buffett also knows a thing or two about this industry leader – MCO occupies a sizable 2.6% allocation in Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. For a man with a highly concentrated portfolio anchored by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), carving out such a large niche for Moody’s signals conviction in its prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd why shouldn’t Buffett have this conviction? Moody’s just delivered another quarter of impressive growth in Q3 2023. Revenue grew 15% year-over-year, powered by strong performance across ratings and research, data and analytics, and M&A. Meanwhile, the company’s EBITDA leapt 32%.\n\nNo doubt, Moody’s trades at a steep premium. Its shares currently command a valuation of roughly 12-times forward sales and 39-times forward earnings. However, the company’s growth prospects support these rich valuations. Analysts forecast annual earnings per share growth of around 15% over the next five years on the back of near double-digit revenue expansion. In an entrenched triopoly that’s strategically expanding its presence across high-margin adjacencies, I believe Moody’s warrants its above-average multiple.\n\nAs an added bonus: Moody’s pays out a small but growing dividend that yields 0.8%. Moody’s offers compelling total return potential as a Buffett-approved blue-chip with fortress positioning in an essential global industry. I agree with the Oracle and his digital doppelgänger that this is a long-term winner.\n\nBrookfield Asset Management (BAM) bam international stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile not currently a Berkshire holding, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) aligns nicely with the Buffett school of thought. This alternative asset manager focuses on real assets like infrastructure, real estate, renewables, and private equity – tangible categories that benefit society. Its value-based approach centers on acquiring high-quality assets during times of distress or dislocation to generate strong risk-adjusted returns.\n\nIn other words, Brookfield brings a long-term lens to its investing framework, and is backed by a strong balance sheet – key “Buffettesque” principles. So, I understand why a digital version of the Oracle tapped Brookfield as an intriguing pick. As attention pivots toward renewable energy and infrastructure spending while real estate rebounds from pandemic lows, this is a company with plenty of tailwinds to consider.\n\nThe company’s growth forecasts look promising, too. Brookfield anticipates 17% annualized sales growth over the next two years alongside 19% earnings growth in 2025. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times based on estimated 2024 earnings seems somewhat rich, I believe this premium makes sense for a company eyeing high-teens bottom-line boosts. Plus, shareholders get paid to wait via a 3.2% dividend yield that should keep growing.\n\nI agree with Buffett Bot that BAM stock warrants a spot in a long-term-focused portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s no secret that Buffett largely missed the boat on new tech like AI over the years. But the small Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) position (recently trimmed) in Berkshire’s portfolio proves that even old dogs can learn some new tricks. And while Buffett may not be ready to fully embrace fast-moving tech disruptors, his digital descendant shows more enthusiasm in tapping Amazon’s immense potential.\n\nNow, AMZN stock trades at a nosebleed valuation. Shares of the e-commerce giant currently trade for more than 82-times trailing earnings. But when you dominate the secular growth engines of e-commerce and cloud like Amazon does, lofty multiples feel warranted. Remember, AWS alone commands a 41.5% market share in the cloud, greater than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) combined!\n\nMeanwhile, early pandemic aftershocks to the e-commerce sector have settled, paving the way for growth re-acceleration. Over the last three years, Amazon’s net sales grew outpaced over 84% of marketwide peers. And though its price-earnings ratio seems extremely rich for a company of this scale, it falls below Amazon’s 5-year average near 120-times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If the Fed signals a possible rate cut in March, the U.S. dollar will likely weaken against all major currencies. As such, Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP and WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund USDU might experience some declines. These two ETFs are the prime beneficiaries of the rising dollar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Amazon (AMZN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AMZN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nAmazon's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Amazon's main business drivers.\n\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\r\n\r\nIts online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish footprint in physical grocery supermarket space.\n\nAmazon also enjoys dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin generating businesses.\n\nAmazon has also become a household name with its Alexa powered Echo devices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa is helping the company sell products and services.\n\nRevenues were $513.98 billion in 2022. The company reports revenue under three broad heads—North America, International and AWS, which generated 61.5%, 23% and 15.6% of total revenues, respectively.\n\nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, Amazon targets three categories of customers—consumers, sellers and website developers. Consumers are offered variety, convenience and free delivery of goods displayed on the company’s websites.\r\n\r\nThe agreements with sellers are varied, enabling them to use the company’s websites to either sell their merchandise directly, or redirect customers to the sellers’ own branded websites. In case of the latter arrangement, Amazon earns a fee for the sales thus generated.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition comes in the form of traditional retailers, other online retailers, media companies, web portals, search engines, e-commerce companies and cloud computing service providers.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Amazon ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2014 would be worth $8,394.59, or a gain of 739.46%, as of January 30, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.76% and the price of gold increased 57.24% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for AMZN.\n\nAmazon’s shares have outperformed the industry over a year. The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, we expect 2023 revenue to be up 10.8% from 2022. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.\n\nShares have gained 6.13% over the past four weeks and there have been 5 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Netflix Is 'Back to Business as Usual' Following Strong Growth",
        "content": "Perhaps the one sentence from Netflix Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NFLX) fourth-quarter earnings call that summarized its earnings report and its 2024 outlook was how Co-CEO Greg Peters characterized the company's performance as back to business as usual.\n\nThe streaming giant published the earnings report for the final quarter of 2023 last week. It not only beat estimates for the quarter, but management also projected higher growth than consensus estimates.\n\nWhile reviewing the company's performance, I observed that management has prioritized stronger free cash in addition to growth while also noting robust demand among paid members. This leads me to believe Netflix's stock is undervalued at current levels.\n\nBusiness model recap\n\nNetflix was founded in the dot-com era as a DVD-by-mail service, allowing users to rent its DVDs online and have them mailed to them. Over the years, the company has gone through a few business transformations as preferences in the target market evolved. Its most well-known and successful transformation to date is turning the company into the most popular video streaming platform in the world by leveraging AWS's cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe company always prioritized an ad-free experience for paying members, but as costs for everyday products and services soared in the post-pandemic era, consumer demand for Netflix's streaming subscription fell precipitously, forcing it to offer subscription plans at cheaper prices with ads. The company also leveraged another opportunity with paid-sharing by allowing family members or friends to share their Netflix account with other family members or friends for a small fee. So far, these strategies seem to have worked for Netflix.\n\nSince it is an app-based subscription-based business, metrics such as volume of paying members and average revenue per member are important metrics to review, in my opinion, to monitor the growth prospects of the business.\n\nStrong fourth-quarter and full-year performance\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023, Netflix beat revenue estimates by 1.3% at $8.8 billion. For the full year, the company's revenue trajectory reversed course back into growth mode, recording 11% year-over-year growth. But what was more interesting to me is that the company expects even stronger growth in 2024, projecting healthy double-digit revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nI believe a majority of the catalysts Netflix may be referring to as they project higher growth this year can be seen in the renewed durability of its subscriber numbers in the table below. Netflix Is 'Back to Business as Usual' Following Strong Growth\n\nFrom the chart above, it is apparent the Europe, Middle East and Africa region has emerged as the top region for Netflix in terms of paid subscriber ads, growing at almost 16% on a year-over-year basis, twice as fast as the number of paid members being added from the U.S. and Canada and almost as fast as the fastest-growing region, Asia Pacifica and China, which is growing at 19% year over year. I believe much of the growth in the EMEA can be attributed to the sustained performance of Netflix's content, such as \"The Crown,\" which drove higher net-paid member additions to its streaming platform.\n\nHowever, I suspect another factor that drove the surge in paid members is the password-sharing crackdown it initiated last year. While many studies have shown a mixed impact on Netflix's revenue, I believe on a net-net basis, this actually added about 15% incremental revenue to Netflix based on this study.\n\nIn terms of operational efficiency, I observe that Netflix's management has prioritized margin expansion this year, as seen from the chart below. Management has also been guided to sustain growth in profit margins over time. Netflix Is 'Back to Business as Usual' Following Strong Growth\n\nNetflix also has a history of holding debt. As of the most recent quarter, the company had around $15 billion in debt. With around $7 billion in cash, Netflix's debt position may look risky. But the company has demonstrated its ability to manage its debt, as is consistent with most large, well-managed enterprises. It has been leaning on a pre-pandemic strategy of issuing high-yield bonds to fund the acquisition and production of content that drives its entire streaming platform. But in 2022, the company announced a move away from its indebted strategy and used its free cash to fund its content plans. In the recent quarter, Netflix pleasantly surprised me by posting roughly $7 billion in free cash, which is approximately four times more than the free cash it recorded in 2022. Moreover, management projected approximately $6 billion in free cash by the end of 2024. Although that will mark a slight deceleration in the growth of the free cash, I still see this as a positive development for Netflix's debt position.\n\nIn terms of valuation, I will assume consensus estimates of margins at 24%. Netflix is guiding for 26% margins in the first quarter of 2024, but I expect that to average out over the remaining three quarters of the year. Based on management's commentary, the ad-tier subscription is a high-margin business, but will only start to meaningfully impact the top and bottom lines from next year onwards. I see the ad-tier subscription as accretive to Netflix's bottom line since it is a high-margin segment. Therefore, I expect margins to grow to 26% over the next five years. Netflix Is 'Back to Business as Usual' Following Strong Growth\n\nNow given that Netflix's operating income will grow at a CAGR of 13.3% over the next five years, which is higher than the 8% average growth in the S&P500, I find it reasonable to pay a premium of 29 times forward earnings. In this case, I expect room for upside from Netflix's current valuation levels.\n\nRisks and other factors to consider\n\nSince Netflix is in the business of selling subscriptions to its streaming platform, I will view this as a consumer discretionary business. Most consumer discretionary businesses tend to be cyclical, as consumers alter their spending patterns based on economic cycles. One of those economic cycles was seen in 2022 as costs soared across the board, consumers cut discretionary spending and Netflix was at the receiving end with revenues declining. Although economists project the global economy will grow about 2.40% in 2024, I will expect the company to be impacted in the case of a surprise recession.\n\nNetflix can also be impacted if it slows the roadmap of its content products. I noted earlier how global content launches had led to a sustained surge in paid members, specifically in the EMEA region. If Netflix is forced to slow down its content plans, it may impact the growth of net-paid members on its platform, which will eventually impact growth. Further, if the quality of content or content licensing worsens, paid members may cancel their subscriptions, causing revenue to decline.\n\nFinally, streaming has become an extremely fragmented, hard-fought industry with multiple players, including Amazon Prime (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and others. Streaming platform differentiation is key here, and Netflix aims to differentiate its platform based on its strengths, which include prices and subscription tiers, content and product features. While the entire streaming industry is maturing and industry players are experimenting with different business formats, I find Netflix's strategy the most interesting. For the first time, the company announced in the earnings call, the size of its total addressable market at $600 billion, which today equals 5% penetration. Netflix's TAM has expanded beyond streaming and now includes Gaming, Connected TV and ad-tiers. Also, for the first time, management announced its ad business has been growing 70% sequentially this quarter. While these are very early days for Netflix's ad tier, I strongly feel the company is well-positioned to benefit from a robust ad-based streaming industry. Management also noted the progress it is making in building out ad-based partnership products and ad-measurement tools that eventually generate meaningful high-margin revenue contributions to Netflix's top line.\n\nTakeaways\n\nNetflix's recent quarter demonstrates the focus and ability of its management to deliver on long-term goals of prioritizing high-margin growth while growing free cash at the same time. The company's pivot away from its debt strategy is working while subscribers are returning to the platform. Given all of the recent developments, I see upside for Netflix.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Amazon Takes Its Roomba Back to the Store",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- There are two ways to look at the collapse of Amazon.com Inc.’s deal to buy iRobot Corp., which makes Roomba vacuum cleaners. The one that led the companies’ joint statement Monday cited “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Traders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts UPS to Cut 12,000 Jobs, Bring Workers in Five Days a Week\n\nBut there’s another potential explanation: buyer’s remorse.\n\nIn the 17 months since Amazon agreed to the deal, iRobot’s business has faltered. Faced with the choice of going to war with regulators — potentially in a years-long quagmire on both sides of the Atlantic — or cutting its losses, Amazon chose to bail.\n\nFrom its home base in Bedford, Massachusetts, iRobot has long punched above its weight. The Roomba has been so successful that it defined its own product category.\n\nWhat competitors lacked in brand recognition, though, they made up for in low prices and shipping volume. The robot vacuum market now has “an unprecedented number of players,” according to Parks Associates, which tracks smart home devices. That includes a multitude of startups, South Korean and Chinese electronics giants and stalwart vacuum brands like Bissell and Dyson.\n\nIn a survey of US households with home internet that Parks Associates conducted in early 2019, 63% of respondents who owned a robot vacuum reported having a Roomba. By the end of last year, that share was down to 48%.\n\nIRobot has blamed “increased pricing competition” for dragging on sales. It held layoffs in 2022 and 2023, subleased part of its headquarters and scaled back advertising and research and development. The company has incurred about $500 million in losses since 2021.\n\nWhen Amazon called off its $1.4 billion purchase on Monday, iRobot announced yet another round of cuts, totaling 31% of its workforce, and the departure of its chief executive officer.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpokespeople for Amazon and IRobot declined to comment beyond their public statements. In one of them, David Zapolsky, Amazon’s general counsel, said the termination of the deal will “deny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which we’re confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable.”\n\nAmazon's top lawyer also suggested the regulatory scrutiny from Washington and Brussels would prove self-defeating: “Mergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren’t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics.”\n\nThe retreat is something of a new look for Amazon, which has defended itself against past charges of anticompetitive practices, betting its moves would stand up in court if it came to it. Amazon faced down skeptical regulators during its recent purchases of MGM and One Medical. With iRobot, Amazon didn’t even offer European regulators a compromise, or what’s known in regulatory negotiations as a merger remedy.\n\nThe financial impact to Amazon of walking away will be minimal: a $94 million breakup fee, which iRobot will use to pay down debt and compensate its financial advisers. For Amazon, which has $64 billion in cash, it’s like a restocking fee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best internet retail stocks to buy. To skip our analysis of the e-commerce and online retail industry, go directly to the 5 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy.\n\nIn recent years, e-commerce has evolved into a crucial component of the global retail landscape. The internet's advent has brought about significant transformations in the buying and selling of goods, mirroring broader shifts toward digitalization in contemporary society. With the widespread adoption of the internet, consumers worldwide are reaping the benefits of seamless online transactions. The surge in global internet access, surpassing five billion users, has led to a continual rise in the number of individuals engaging in online purchases.\n\nA notable trend in the realm of e-commerce is the remarkable prevalence of mobile device usage. In 2023, smartphones constituted more than 70% of all retail website visits globally, subsequently generating the majority of online orders when compared to desktops and tablets. The swift adoption of mobile devices, particularly in regions with limited digital infrastructure, indicates that mobile integration will persistently influence the future shopping experience. Notably, mobile commerce (m-commerce) has gained significant popularity in Asia, with countries like China and South Korea generating over two-thirds of their total online sales through mobile devices.\n\nDuring the pandemic, e-commerce sales experienced significant growth as consumers avoided physical stores, leading to a surge in sales for certain products. Home improvement projects and electronic gadgets, in particular, saw increased spending as travel and entertainment options were limited. Throughout the pandemic, retailers faced challenges such as shortages and supply chain disruptions as they tried to meet the heightened demand. However, the situation has now shifted, with concerns about inflation and potential recessions influencing consumer behavior and resulting in excess inventory for some retailers. Following the aforementioned surge, numerous retail and consumer packaged goods companies experienced a notable deceleration in the growth of online sales in 2022. However, despite a return of consumers to physical stores, e-commerce is anticipated to represent 41% of global retail sales by 2027, marking a substantial rise from its 2017 share of merely 18%, as indicated by research from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strong performance of internet retail stocks, including those of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd – ADR (NYSE:BABA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), can serve as a motivating factor for investors considering investments in the retail sector today. These companies are often regarded as some of the best retail stocks to buy at present. 12 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy\n\nA close-up of a customer's hands selecting beauty products from an online retailer.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn the process of compiling our selection of the best internet retail stocks, we initially identified companies involved in online retail and e-commerce.

As earnings start to recover, these stocks and semiconductors tend to be among the first to move. We may be a little early and could see some choppiness in stock prices as job growth and consumer spending cool due to the lagged effects of Fed tightening, but we believe we’re closer to the bottom in terms of economic activity and that both companies, as well as Union Pacific, are well-positioned to benefit as consumer sentiment improves and the economy begins to recover.”\n\n7.

Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\n\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) stands as a leading provider of internet infrastructure for commerce, delivering tools that empower businesses to initiate, expand, market, and oversee retail operations across any scale. Utilized by millions of businesses in 175 countries, Shopify's platform and services play a pivotal role in supporting a diverse range of enterprises.\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings report, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) witnessed a notable 25% surge in total revenue, reaching $1.7 billion compared to the previous year.

(NYSE:SHOP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Shopify Inc. is a cloud-based software provider for multi-channel commerce. Shares gave back some of their strong performance from the first half of 2023, declining 15.5% on the back of rising concerns related to the health of the consumer and the expansion of TikTok and Temu into the U.S. While we are cognizant of these near-term risks, we believe that Shopify will continue to benefit from its position as the commerce operating system for its merchants. Rather than replacing Shopify, various selling channels, including TikTok, are managed within the platform, which should enable Shopify to maintain its competitive advantage over the long term. During the quarter, Shopify announced an agreement with Amazon that will allow merchants to offer Buy with Prime within the Shopify ecosystem, enabling Shopify to act as the payments provider for these transactions and alleviating a key concern. Lastly, the company also reported strong financial results, including 17% year-over-year gross merchandise volume growth, 31% revenue growth, and consensus-beating non-GAAP operating income that outpaced estimates by over $90 million. We remain shareholders due to Shopify’s strong competitive positioning, innovative culture, and long runway for growth, as it still holds less than a 2% share of the global commerce market.”\n\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) joins the ranks of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd – ADR (NYSE:BABA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) as one of the best retail stocks to invest in.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy 15 Stocks That Will Outperform the S&P 500 in 2024 12 Best German Dividend Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Amazon has officially joined the ranks of companies with ads on their streaming services.\n\nUsers watching Prime Video content in the U.S. began automatically having \"limited\" ads on Monday, roughly four months after the e-commerce giant first signaled its plans to do so. Other countries are also slated to begin seeing ads.\n\nAmerican users must now fork over a $2.99 monthly fee to get an ad-free Prime Video streaming experience instead of the default with them. That is in addition to either the $14.99 they owe Amazon each month for an overall Prime membership or the $8.99 for Prime Video by itself.\n\nAMAZON NOTIFIES PRIME VIDEO USERS ADS WILL START JANUARY 29\n\nAmazon has kept the price at $14.99 a month for Prime since 2022, a price that is staying flat for those who do not upgrade to go ad free. Amazon Prime Video will start including advertisements next year, the company says, although it will be offering a new ad-free plan.\n\nNo matter which subscription users have, live events and Amazon Freevee programming will keep showing ads, the company said on its website.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said in late October that Prime Video \"continues to be an integral part of the Prime value proposition where it’s often one of the top 2 drivers of customers signing up for Prime.\"\n\nAmazon, like other companies with streaming platforms, cited its aim to keep investing in its content as the reason for it bringing ads. Companies have also used ads to drum up more revenue from streaming.\n\nAMAZON LAYING OFF HUNDREDS AT PRIME VIDEO, MGM STUDIO, TWITCH DIVISIONS\n\nMax, Netflix and Disney+ are among the platforms that have previously debuted memberships with ads. A bowl of popcorn and TV remote control on a coffee table, with Netflix streaming on a television in the background, taken on March 6, 2020.\n\nSome streaming services have also been upping the prices of ad-free options and taking other steps to try to get users to increasingly embrace ad-supported plans. In this photo illustration, the logos of media service providers, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney + and Hulu are displayed on the screen of a television on Nov. 20, 2019 in Paris.\n\nNetflix has seen particular success with its ad-supported tier. The company, which has restricted account-sharing outside of households, rolled the option out to certain countries in November 2022.\n\nThe number of monthly active Netflix users with the ad-supported plan has reached 23 million, the streaming giant said earlier in the month. It saw a jump of nearly 70% in subscriptions to the tier between the third and final quarters of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMAZON TERMINATES IROBOT ACQUISITION DUE TO REGULATORY HURDLES\n\n\"Our aim is to make ads a more substantial revenue stream that contributes to sustained, healthy revenue growth in 2025 and beyond,\" Netflix said.\n\nEric Revell contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Amazon begins showing ads on Prime Video, jumping on a streaming trend",

        "title": "History Says the S&amp;P 500 May Climb in the Triple Digits During This Bull Market. 3 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Before it Does.",
        "content": "After a 2022 in the doldrums and a 2023 of recovery, investors finally were able to cheer this month. That's because the S&P 500 reached a new high, signaling we are indeed in a bull market. These sorts of markets only can be declared after they've begun. That's because, to be in bull territory, an index must climb 20% from its bear market low and reach a record high.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you're missing out on bull market gains if you only start investing right now. If we take a look into the past, history shows us bull markets generally last much longer than bear markets -- nearly nine years compared with 1.4 years, according to data compiled by Raymond James & Associates.\n\nAnd the data also show that during the past bull markets from the mid-1970s to the present, each bull market has delivered triple-digit gains. In fact, the S&P 500 climbed more than 280% over a period of about eight years during that last such phase. So, history suggests the S&P 500 -- so far up about 35% since its bear market low -- may advance in the triple digits during this bull market. Here are three top growth stocks to buy before it does. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) soared last year as it showed investors it could rebound from tough times -- and go on to grow. Hurt by rising inflation back in 2022, the company reported its first annual loss in almost a decade. But Amazon quickly turned things around by cutting costs, improving efficiency across its fulfillment network, and investing in key growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe efforts are bearing fruit, with Amazon shifting back to growth in operating income and reporting inflows of cash instead of outflows. In the most recent quarter, net sales climbed in the double digits, operating income quadrupled, and the company reported an inflow of more than $21 billion in cash compared with billion-dollar outflows a year earlier.\n\nMost importantly, though, the moves Amazon made will help the company continue to grow earnings -- and the results may be especially spectacular in a market favoring growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, I love the fact that Amazon is a leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing -- two markets expanding in the double digits.\n\nAll of this makes this stock an excellent one to own in a growth market.\n\n2. Intellia Therapeutics\n\nIntellia Therapeutics(NASDAQ: NTLA) develops candidates in the potentially game-changing area of CRISPR gene editing. I say \"game changing\" because gene editing fixes the faulty genes responsible for disease, therefore producing curative therapies.\n\nJust recently, regulators gave the first nod ever to a CRISPR-based product -- CRISPR Therapeutics' blood disorder treatment, Casgevy. This represents a key milestone for the whole industry because it shows regulators are amenable to approving treatments using this cutting-edge technology. (Intellia and CRISPR Therapeutics don't compete directly because they focus on different illnesses.)\n\nToday, Intellia is moving closer and closer to the finish line. The company is enrolling patients for a phase 3 trial of its candidate for transthyretin amyloidosis, a condition that impacts the heart and other organs. And Intellia completed enrollment in a phase 2 trial of its candidate for hereditary angioedema, a condition that involves extreme swelling.\n\nIntellia also is in a solid financial position to move these programs forward, with more than $1 billion in cash that could fund operations through mid-2026.\n\nIf Intellia's candidates continue to deliver positive results in their late-stage trials, the stock could move significantly higher from today's levels.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) in the most recent quarter reached a big milestone: $72 million in net income, its highest ever. The data analytics company, once best known for its work for governments, has made significant progress expanding its commercial business in recent times.\n\nAnd Palantir's launch of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) last year offered it a significant boost. AIP brings the power of large language models to customers, helping them maximize the potential of their data. For example, Palantir, through AIP, has helped customers deploy AI-based process mining and automation workflows. By understanding and streamlining a company's processes, that company can save both time and money.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue increased 33%, and its U.S. commercial customer count climbed 37%. This is key because chief executive officer Alex Karp calls this business \"the new and emerging center of our company.\" At the same time, Palantir's government revenue continues to advance in the double digits, showing this company has what it takes to win in both business areas.\n\nPalantir shares trade for 55x forward earnings estimates right now, a very reasonable level for a leading AI growth stock -- and one that could stand out in the new bull market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett Own This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. And It Looks Dirt Cheap Right Now.",
        "content": "Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett don't have a ton in common.\n\nBuffett is an investor who traditionally seeks steady growth and often looks for dividend plays. This simple investment strategy has become a modern-day staple for investors of all ages. On the other side, Wood has taken bullish stances on emerging markets such as artificial intelligence (AI), genomics, and many others.\n\nBuffett, who long averted investments in the technology sector, shocked the world back in 2016 after taking a sizable position in Apple. The iPhone maker has rewarded Buffett handsomely, and now comprises nearly 50% of his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.\n\nWhile Buffett owns a finite number of stocks in the technology sector, there is one AI company in particular that he shares with Wood. E-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are both held in Berkshire Hathaway and Wood's exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nInvesting along the lines of Buffett and Wood puts investors in some pretty good company. Let's dig into Amazon stock and assess if now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.\n\nHow is Amazon disrupting AI?\n\nTo be clear, Wood and Buffett have each owned Amazon for several years -- well before all the hype surrounding AI came about. Nevertheless, interest in artificial intelligence (AI) fueled tech stocks in particular last year and largely contributed to meaningful gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, it seems like the majority of the chatter is garnered by Microsoft-backed ChatGPT. In addition, demand for semiconductors used to train generative AI models has resulted in a lot of attention around Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices in particular. While it's easy to become captivated by these exciting developments, investors should remember that there are many other players quietly making inroads in AI.\n\nFor Amazon, the company's multibillion-dollar investment in an AI start-up called Anthropic could carry some lucrative tailwinds. As part of the deal, Anthropic will be using Amazon as its primary cloud provider. Over the last year, a sluggish macroeconomy has significantly impacted Amazon's cloud growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the new partnership with Anthropic could be an opportunity to return to accelerated growth. Furthermore, Amazon's new managed service, called Bedrock, is already experiencing positive momentum as applications leveraging large language models (LLMs), among other tools, become more of a fixture for corporate IT budgets. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSome things to keep in mind\n\nWhen it comes to owning Amazon, there is something deeper that Wood and Buffett both share: The stock is an extremely nominal holding for them. For Wood, Amazon comprises just 0.06% of her total portfolio. Furthermore, the e-commerce giant represents a mere 0.40% of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nIt's important for investors to understand that following the moves of larger, more prominent funds is not a guarantee for success. Although institutional support can be viewed as a positive, investors should not take a position in a certain stock or asset just because a notable money manager did so.\n\nAmazon stock looks like a bargain AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe chart illustrates the price-to-sales (P/S) multiple for Amazon benchmarked against a cohort of other megacap tech enterprises. At a P/S of just 2.9, Amazon is the least expensive stock in the \"Magnificent Seven\" based on this metric. Interestingly, this P/S level is also very much in line with Amazon's 10-year average of 3.1.\n\nI find this intriguing because over the last decade, Amazon has achieved quite a bit. The company is an undisputed leader among cloud providers, fending off stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle. Moreover, Amazon has entered several other end markets, including streaming and advertising. Now, with artificial intelligence being at the center of the next evolution of Amazon Web Services, the company's return to accelerated revenue and free cash flow looks very much in sight.\n\nI think investors are broadly miscalculating -- perhaps underappreciating -- Amazon's potential within the AI landscape, and as such are discounting the stock relative to its peers. In turn, investors have been presented with a unique opportunity to buy shares at an attractive valuation. Now looks like a great time to employ a dollar-cost averaging strategy and begin building a long-term position in Amazon stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures hovered broadly around the flatline on Tuesday, with traders gearing up for a flurry of earnings, data, and central bank decisions this week. Artificial intelligence is set to be a major focus in the latest quarterly reports from tech behemoths Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) later today. Boeing (NYSE:BA) scraps an application to speed up the official certification of its upcoming 737 Max 7 jet following heavy scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers.\n\n1. Futures subdued\n\nU.S. stock futures were subdued on Tuesday, as investors awaited the release of fresh earnings from several big-name companies, a bevy of key economic data, and a major Federal Reserve policy decision.\n\nBy 05:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 44 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 2 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly flat.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session, with the benchmark S&P 500 in particular surging by 0.8% to a fresh record high close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped by 1.12% and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) slumped by 8.8% after the robot vacuum maker and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced they had mutually agreed to terminate a planned merger due to opposition from EU antitrust regulators. Elsewhere, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) soared by 20.2% after the online personal finance group posted better-than-anticipated quarterly profit.\n\n2. Microsoft, Alphabet earnings ahead\n\nTech giant Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet are set to unveil their latest quarterly earnings after the close of trading in New York on Tuesday, in the first wave of potentially market-moving corporate results this week.\n\nFor Microsoft, the figures come after the Redmond, Washington-based company's stock market value topped $3 trillion for the first time ever last week.\n\nUndergirding this sky-high valuation is Microsoft's investment in OpenAI, whose ChatGPT chatbot has become one of the focal points of recent growing enthusiasm over generative artificial intelligence. Analysts will likely be paying close attention to any comments from the firm's executives regarding how they hope to deploy the nascent technology, particularly at its crucial Azure cloud computing division.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, has recently launched its own advanced AI play, dubbed Gemini. The YouTube-owner has lauded this model as a sophisticated tool for crunching disparate pieces of information like video, text, and audio, with Chief Executive Sundar Pichai calling it \"one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we've undertaken.\"\n\nAI will also be front-and-center for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) when the chipmaker posts results after the bell later today. Analysts already hiked their price target for the semiconductor group earlier this month, citing the benefits of elevated demand for AI-powered chips.\n\n3. Boeing withdraws request for 737 Max 7 safety exemption\n\nBoeing has confirmed that it is withdrawing its request for a safety exemption for a new series of its popular 737 Max planes, as the jetmaker wrangles with the continuing fallout from a dangerous mid-air door plug breach earlier this month.\n\nThe exemption would have allowed U.S. regulators to expedite the process of approving Boeing's upcoming 737 Max 7. Investors had widely anticipated that it would receive the official green light in the first half of this year.\n\nMore doubt now surrounds the timeline for the much-anticipated certification of both the Max 7 and Boeing's larger Max 10. According to Reuters, the company may be forced to roll out design changes more quickly than it had originally planned.\n\nBoeing's decision also comes after it faced heavy pressure from U.S. lawmakers last week to withdraw its application for the exemption. U.S. Senator and aviation subcommittee chair Tammy Duckworth took a particularly strong stance against the request, arguing that it could have \"catastrophic consequences on passenger safety.\"\n\n4. BYD shares slip after disappointing profit forecast\n\nBYD (SZ:002594), the Warren Buffett-backed group that recently dethroned Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world's biggest electric vehicle (EV) maker by sales volume, has forecast full-year profit that missed analyst expectations, sending shares lower on Tuesday.\n\nThe Chinese EV company said it now expects to report annual profit of between 29 billion yuan and 31 billion yuan, implying a rise of as much as 86.49% versus the prior year. However, the pace would be far slower than its 2022 net earnings growth of 446%.\n\nAnalysts at Nomura noted that the outlook was 4% to 10% below their projections, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a research note.\n\nBYD flagged that it was facing \"fierce competition\" in China's EV industry, which has contributed to an intensifying price war among domestic automakers desperate to entice cost-wary consumers. Even still, the Shenzhen-based company said it has demonstrated \"strong resilience\" to these pressures, adding that it has been boosted by \"rapid\" expansion in overseas sales and expense reductions in its supply chain.\n\n5. Crude inches up amid Middle East tensions\n\nOil prices inched up on Tuesday after the previous session’s losses, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East fueled supply concerns.\n\nBy 05:01 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.5% higher at $77.13 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed by $82.15 per barrel.\n\nCrude markets are on edge after the U.S. vowed to take \"all necessary actions\" to defend its troops following a deadly drone attack in Jordan by Iran-backed militants, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nThe crude contracts fell over $1 on Monday as a deepening real estate crisis contributed to worries about demand from China, the world's biggest crude consumer.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "content": "Shaquille O’Neal’s production company Jersey Legends will be producing a docuseries with Axios. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nBusiness and tech news startup Axios is getting back into the streaming game again. Axios announced last Friday (Jan. 26) it’s launching a new division called Axios Entertainment, where it will develop and produce nonfiction programming, in both series and films. The move is a “natural next step” for the company according to its CEO Jim VandeHei. Its first video project is being done in partnership with Amazon (AMZN) and will stream on Prime Video.\n\nThe new entertainment division will be led by Axio’s head of development, Erica Winograd, who has developed video programming for other media organizations, including Refinery29 and Vox Media.\n\nAxios’ first foray into the entertainment sphere was through a television series deal with HBO in 2018 and  lasted for four seasons. Titled Axios, the show focused on interview-style reporting, featuring business executives like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and topical politicians like President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. HBO canceled the show in 2021, shortly before it won an Emmy that year. According to reporting from Puck News, HBO executives had “lost their appetite for news programing” and were focusing on developing HBO’s own streaming business.\n\nAxios’s new venture features a roster of collaborations with celebrity production companies, including Tom Brady’s Shadow Lion and Chrissy Teigen’s Huntley Productions.\n\n“Entertainment programming is a natural next step for Axios, using engaging documentary storytelling to make audiences smarter, faster about the ever-changing world around them,” CEO VandeHei, who is also the cofounder of Axios, said in a statement on Jan. 26.\n\nVandeHei founded Axios in 2016 with Mike Allen and Roy Schwartz. All three were journalists for Politico, of which VandeHei is a cofounder. VandeHei has said he envisioned Axios to be a mix between The Economist and Twitter by delivering well-reported news in an efficient format for readers. Allen reports for Axios and writes its daily Axios AM and Axios PM newsletters. Schwartz is CEO of Axios HQ, an artificial intelligence software program that assists companies with their internal communications efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAxios was bought out by Cox Enterprises in 2022 for $525 million, a deal that also helped the company further access the local journalism market. Cox was an investor in the company prior to the acquisition.\n\nThe show launching with Amazon will be a docuseries called The Money Game produced with Campfire Studios and Shaquille O’Neal’s production company, Jersey Legends, about the recent policy change by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to allow athletes to control and profit from their name, image and likeness (called NIL).\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nCourt Concedes DNC Had the Right to Rig Primaries Against Sanders MrBeast's First X Video Raises More Questions Than Answers About X's Creator Program 'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning A Long-Lost Gustav Klimt Portrait Could Fetch $54M at Auction ‘Expats’ Review: Amazon’s Smart, Complex Drama Series Has Something Missing\n\nRead the original story Axios Forays Into Video Products (Again) With Celebrity Collaborations and others by Nhari Djan at Observer.",

        "title": "Amazon says Prime deliveries reached their fastest speeds ever last year",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon delivered packages to its Prime customers at the fastest speeds ever in 2023, the retailer said Tuesday, thanks to better inventory placement, a new regionalization model for shipments and more same-day warehouses.\n\nThe company had indicated in public announcements and corporate earning calls last year that packages were arriving faster on the doorsteps of Prime members, who pay $139 per year – or $14.99 per month – for speedy deliveries and other perks.\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, Doug Herrington, CEO of Amazon's worldwide stores business, provided more details on parcel shipments made during the holiday shopping season, which saw strong consumer spending despite price increases and high borrowing costs.\n\nIn the last three months of 2023, Herrington said Amazon increased the number of items it delivered the same day – or overnight – in the U.S. by more than 65% year-over-year. More than 70% of Prime orders arrived same day or the next across the Atlantic in the U.K.\n\nOverall, Amazon said it delivered 7 billion items with same or next day shipping last year. The company declined to provide comparable figures on shipping data from 2022.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has credited speedier deliveries to improvements in inventory management and growth in its same-day delivery sites. The company currently has 55 of these sites in metro areas across the U.S. with plans to add more in the coming years.\n\nFaster shipping is also being driven by a new operations network, which splits the country up into smaller regions and ships items from those areas. The new model – which follows a pandemic boom in the company’s logistics footprint and subsequent cutbacks - also helps Amazon cut down on costs since packages travel a shorter distance and have fewer touchpoints.\n\nSarah Matthew, Amazon’s vice president for delivery experience, said in an interview that the online retailer is continuously analyzing its regions – including the buildings and inventories within them - and plans to refine it to better serve customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut despite Amazon’s focus on speed, some rural Prime customers have complained about slower delivery speeds.\n\nThe company relies on independent contractors as well as carriers like UPS to ship orders to customers. It’s also been recruiting small businesses that can help it deliver directly to hard-to-reach rural areas.\n\nWhen asked about rural deliveries, Matthew said the company is paying attention to anecdotal customer experiences but doesn’t see a “general trend” showing a slowdown.\n\nAmazon’s focus on speed has put it in the crosshairs of labor advocates, who argue the company’s fast-paced warehouses lead to more injuries among warehouse workers. The company's latest data from 2022 shows the rate of injuries or illness that occurred among Amazon’s U.S. workforce fell that year. But it was still higher than it was in 2020.\n\nLast year, Amazon began testing a robotic storage system called Sequoia, which puts inventory into totes and presents it to employees so they don’t have to bend or stretch as much. The company says the robot also reduces the time it takes to process an order by 25%.\n\nAmazon is planning to roll out Sequoia to more warehouses this year. It declined to say how many facilities will benefit from it.\n\nOther retailers, including Walmart and Target, have also been working to achieve faster shipments for online orders.",

        "title": "The 3 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy in January 2024",
        "content": "Cloud computing stocks will continue to be prominent wealth generators for tech-oriented investors. With the emergence of generative AI, investors can continue to benefit from the tailwinds of cloud computing infrastructure. As a central component for businesses, cloud computing will continue to play a significant role in how data is shared, stored, and scaled at large. This is made cloud computing stocks to buy very desirable.\n\nThe demand for cloud services is stronger than ever, with particular companies holding market share dominance. If you’re seeking growth opportunities that have the potential to outperform the market, then you should look no further than this industry.\n\nNow, let’s explore the three best cloud computing stocks 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) makes a strong case as the best cloud computing stocks to buy in January 2024. Oracle’s industry leading cloud computing platform has seen an acceleration in demand, largely driven by generative AI offerings. Furthermore, the company is in the midst of a huge data center expansion in the cloud infrastructure market.\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence has created a new outlook for the cloud computing market. This is particularly evident for Oracle, as they are one of the leading cloud computing companies in the world. Oracle currently holds approximately 8% market share in the cloud infrastructure market, and generative AI is set to be a huge business driver moving forward. In Q2 FY24, Oracle’s revenue grew 5% YOY to $12.9 billion.\n\nCloud revenue grew 25% to $4.8 billion, with cloud infrastructure revenue up 52%. CTO Larry Ellison is bullish on their ability to build and scale new data centers both rapidly and inexpensively. With Oracle’s cloud businesses at a $20 billion run rate, now is a great time to snap up shares in January 2024.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock just recently crossed the $3 trillion market cap status. Wall Street is becoming increasingly bullish on its generative AI prospects, as Azure cloud deployment starts to ramp up in FY24. Microsoft Azure, is one of the leading cloud computing companies in the world, used by more than 95% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe 2024 fiscal year will be a significant transition year for Microsoft, as they begin to ramp up their generative AI offerings. There are a number of different catalysts to look forward to, including Microsoft’s copilot software. This software is going to be a game changer for its Azure cloud customers, increasing both workloads and productivity at scale. They will be able to leverage LLMs to scale generative AI applications and operate Azure services with improved cost-structure and security.\n\nMicrosoft has been gradually increasing CAPEX to meet the growing demands of generative AI services, with cloud revenue seeing strong double digit growth. In Q1 FY24, revenue in the intelligence cloud surged 19% YOY to $24.3 billion. Integration across its entire tech stack is just beginning, and its early bets on AI are already paying dividends.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) should need no introduction when considering the best cloud computing stocks to buy. Their wholly owned subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the largest cloud services company in the world. They hold nearly a one-third market share in cloud infrastructure services.\n\nAmazon is about to close off a strong 2023 fiscal year, and 2024 should prove to be another transformative year. Generative AI tailwinds continue to show promising signs of growth ahead, as demand skyrockets for its AWS customer base. Throughout 2023, Amazon has implemented significant cost-cutting measures in order to strengthen their position in the AI race. Restructuring efforts have proven to be material, as revenue, EPS, and operating income have risen to the occasion.\n\nAdditionally, AWS revenue is trending in the right direction and growth is likely to accelerate over the next decade. In Q3 2023, AWS revenue increased 12% YOY to $23.1 billion. Generative AI offerings have been the primary driver, and investors should expect growth to continue in FY24.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Alphabet delivered 11% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income jumped by an even more impressive 42% year-over-year. That growth helped the company exceed a 25% net profit margin.\n\nAlphabet has received several “Buy” ratings and has an average price target of $162.17.

        "content": "Your money won’t do much good sitting in your bank account because of dismal rates on savings accounts. While there is a benefit to using certificates of deposit to get higher rates, the stock market offers more exciting returns. Most notably, those facing future industry investment opportunities.\n\nYou may not have to look any further than these top seven stocks to uncover those very future industry investment opportunities.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a cybersecurity firm that offers next-gen cybersecurity tools. The firm continues to maintain high revenue growth while experiencing meaningful profit margin expansion. For example, the company reported 20% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Growth in remaining performance obligations outpaced revenue growth which is a good sign for future revenue figures.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNet income surged by 871% year-over-year. Continued net income growth can make the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio far more appealing. That’s the primary weakness for PANW, but long-term investors will have an easier time overlooking the current valuation. Shares trade at a 64 forward P/E ratio which can drop considerably if net income growth remains elevated.\n\nThe stock has more than doubled over the past year and is up by 367% over the past five years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top stocks seeing substantial future industry investment opportunities is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which became a trillion-dollar company. Growth in its tech and artificial intelligence (AI) segment is still strong and helped Nvidia more than triple its revenue year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nNvidia recently announced RTX Video HDR which uses AI to improve video quality. Developers can use this resource to improve the quality of games and video. Streamed videos can enhance streamed videos to 4k and offer a better experience for viewers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s one of the many ways Nvidia is using artificial intelligence to give consumers and businesses better products and services. Nvidia also partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to help sellers create better product listings with artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia has partnered with many corporations to expand its dominance in the artificial intelligence industry. Shares are up by 219% over the past year and recorded a five-year gain of 1,587%.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) is helping business owners protect their websites from cyberattacks. The firm serves over 30% of the Fortune 1,000 and has over 182,000 paying customers.\n\nCloudflare has grown rapidly since its 2010 launch and has amassed a $27 billion market cap. Even with the historical growth, Cloudflare continues to report solid revenue growth. The company exhibited 32% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net losses narrowed by 44.7% year-over-year and sat at $23.5 million.\n\nCloudflare is strengthening its offering with the help of artificial intelligence. Workers AI has helped Cloudflare strengthen its efforts to keep customers and users secure. Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, mentioned in the Q3 2023 press release that the company is making more investments in AI.\n\n“By the end of 2024, we expect to have inference-optimized GPUs running in nearly every location where Cloudflare operates worldwide—within milliseconds of every Internet user,” he stated.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) logo on a smartphone which is next to a miniature shopping cart and miniature cardboard boxes\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) offers e-commerce software that helps other businesses run e-commerce stores. Customers pay Shopify a monthly subscription to keep their e-commerce stores up and running.\n\nShopify has a Starter plan which costs $5/mo. It’s a low barrier of entry to help people get started. The company also has high-end plans for corporations. Enterprise plans can cost thousands of dollars per month.\n\nThe recurring revenue model helped Shopify deliver 25% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. The company already has a 10% market share in U.S. e-commerce. Shopify is likely to further penetrate the industry and reward long-term investors. The firm also has a strong international presence based on its millions of merchants spread across over 175 countries.\n\nShopify has been a top-performing stock for several years. Shares are up by 73% over the past year and have gained 378% over the past five years.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a customer relationship management tool that helps businesses communicate with their audiences and get in front of potential customers.

Shares are up by 69% over the past year and have gained 269% over the past five years.\n\nHubSpot has a vast customer base that consists of over 194,000 businesses in more than 120 countries. The company delivered 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. A 22% year-over-year increase in HubSpot’s customer base helped fuel the company’s top-line growth.\n\nWhile HubSpot has always been known for high revenue growth, the firm took a big step in narrowing its losses. The company only reported a GAAP net loss of $5.5 million. That’s much lower than the $31.4 million GAAP net loss from the same period last year.\n\nHubSpot is aiming to generate $556 million to $558 million in revenue in Q4 2023. The midpoint implies 18.5% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a vegan makeup company that avoids unethical ingredients.

(GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) operates in several verticals but specializes in online advertising and cloud computing. Google and YouTube generate most of the company’s revenue while Google Cloud has gained considerable market share over the years.\n\nWhile Google Cloud makes up a smaller percentage of Alphabet’s business, this segment delivers higher revenue growth rates than the Google advertising segment. Alphabet has a distant lead among advertising competitors and delivered 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 2023. Net income was up by 42% year-over-year.\n\nBoth of those growth rates are improvements compared to 2022 growth rates. Incorporating artificial intelligence to improve search, YouTube, cloud, and Pixel devices has helped Alphabet gain momentum.\n\nThe company has been trimming its expenses to generate higher profit margins. Alphabet is in a position to use additional capital to invest in promising long-term ventures. This approach can help the company develop an additional meaningful income stream that isn’t advertising or the cloud.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA, NET, and ELF.

        "content": "Shares of embattled Chinese property developer Evergrande (3333.HK) sank as the company now faces liquidation after failing to successfully restructure. Other Chinese equities like Pinduoduo (PDD) were also under pressure in Monday's trading.\n\nEV maker Lucid Group (LCID) has received a Buy alert from Motley Fool on Monday. The stock climbed on the bullish call.\n\niRobot Corp. (IRBT) shares declined after Amazon (AMZN) terminated the acquisition deal between the companies, citing no viable path to EU regulatory approval. Amazon will pay a $94 million termination fee. iRobot will also be cutting jobs and its CEO is departing after the failed purchase.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\n- Let's check in on some of the top trending tickers as we count down to the closing bell here. China's largest property developer Evergrande facing liquidation after courts deemed the company incapable of delivering on restructuring plans. Shares of US-listed Chinese companies being dragged down as well in today's trade.\n\nSo that was the headline on Evergrande here. So ordered, Julie, to liquidate by this Hong Kong court. Of course, the one time China's biggest property developer by sales. And kind of brings up this really broader question we've asked different strategists about, which is, do you want to put money to work in China? Now is there opportunity there? Or at this point, do you see sort of a giant value trap?\n\n- Well-- and this story is particularly interesting for foreign investors in the-- in China because how the court handles this liquidation is relevant to foreign holders of some of those assets. And so foreign investors are going to be watching this very quickly as well.\n\nBut what strikes me as we looked at those other China stocks is it's been a pretty uneven reaction. You know, yes, some of those stocks have been down sharply. But then like an Alibaba, which is an enormous Chinese company, it's not down that much. PDD, Pinduoduo, is up-- is down quite a bit here. And we were trying to sort of figure out what was going on.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's one analyst over at Citi who says maybe it is some of the chatter around potential import tariffs on Chinese companies. Pinduoduo owns Temu, which has been increasing its business in the United States. It's a-- an e-tailer. So maybe that's part of what's going on. If there is another Trump presidency, we could see that kind of a tariff put in place. That's something he's talked about at least.\n\n- Yeah, I mean, we've had-- recently, we've had market strategists use very strong language about whether you want to put money there, right? I mean, they've used--\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- --words like uninvestable. Now we did hear from-- there was another side that we heard from Dan--\n\n- Yes.\n\n- --Niles last week, which I thought was really interesting as Dan is well-known, well-respected tech Investor. He took the other side of that trade and basically said, listen, if you think China's economy is going to zero, it's uninvestable.\n\n- Right.\n\n- But when he looks at some of these names that we're talking about here like Baidu or Tencent, Alibaba, he sees revenues climbing but stocks falling. So he said that, you know, the question for him isn't whether it's uninvestable. The question for him is basically, you just have to ask yourself an investor, do you think you're being paid to take risk to move--\n\n- Well-- and the other question you have to ask is how much volatility do you have the stomach for in the meantime while you're waiting to get paid potentially. So that's definitely part of the--\n\n- For sure.\n\n- --part of the factor as well. Let's talk about shares of Lucid as well. Those shares spiking higher after Motley Fool issued a buy alert on the EV maker saying that Lucid's valuation could see a substantial rebound. And the shares, a significant gain above current levels.\n\nListen, we got to couch this. Stuff doesn't always fool-- move on Motley Fool calls, right? And the call did say that this is an exceedingly slim bet that the stock could skyrocket here and go to even 70% of Tesla's value. So it was not a full throated buy recommendation here. But the reaction in the stock has been kind of incredible.\n\n- Yeah, I mean, even with today's pop, it's still down about 25% this year and about 70% over the past 12 months. I mean, what interests me about Lucid-- and it's also can throw in Rivian. You can throw in Tesla. Like, I think everybody is still trying to decide what this EV market broadly looks like this year, what does demand actually look like. And if you just read Tesla's print and listed Tesla's call, I don't think investors took a lot of--\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- --comfort about what that market actually looks like.\n\n- Well, the other big thing to consider here is whenever I see a pop like this, you know where I go. I go to look up short interest. And according to Bloomberg data, 29% of the float of Lucid shares is shorted. That is an extraordinarily high number.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- So what happens in that case is you see a little bit of buying. And then people who have short the stock close out the shorts. That then exacerbates the buying, pushes it up even more, which is probably at least part of what's going on here today.\n\n- And finally, let's get to the last one here, another day, another deal down the drain. Shares of iRobot, they're down big today as Amazon announces it will not move forward with its acquisition of the vacuum makers. They see no path for regulatory approval. So Amazon, Julie, officially drops the planned acquisition of iRobot, the Roomba maker.\n\nAnd of course, we knew regulators. And we talked about this. The EU weren't happy with this deal. And then it sounds like the vacuum makers quickly taken these steps-- CEO stepping down, cutting jobs. It looks like about 350 jobs, about 30% of the workforce.\n\nFor Amazon, you know, listen, they have the resources to keep building out this kind of footprint in smart home devices. But it does speak to kind of broader issues of the regulatory backdrop we've seen here.\n\n- Yeah, I mean, this is another one that was going on for a while. They first proposed this deal back in August of--\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- --2022. And it's taken until now for them to finally say, forget about it, we're done. They are going to be paying a termination fee to iRobot of $94 million. But to your point, iRobot on its own has been struggling here. And actually, Amazon had cut the purchase price last year for iRobot before now taking this step of abandoning the deal entirely.\n\nSo maybe on some level, Amazon feels like the regulators have done it a favor since it was going to take on what had become sort of a struggling asset. But to your point, it does speak to the broader regulatory environment here. It looked like in the EU, maybe they would have accepted some concessions from Amazon. But Amazon got to a point where they didn't want to do the back and forth anymore, it seems.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- We have just the man to talk more about this.\n\n- Yes, we do.",

        "content": "Equinix Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands out with a 2.1% dividend yield, offering a solid investment in the fast-growing data center industry. This sector is at the heart of today’s digital economy, driven by the surge in cloud computing, data consumption, and the Internet of Things. Equinix’s strategic role in this ecosystem is underscored by its partnerships with tech leaders like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), making it an attractive option for investors looking to indirectly engage with the tech sector’s growth.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nThis relationship not only enhances Equinix’s investment allure but also provides a unique avenue to benefit from the tech industry’s dynamism and expansion, similar to receiving dividends from the growth trajectories of Microsoft and AWS. Investors often grapple with the dilemma of choosing between growth and income; growth-centric investments typically lack regular income streams, while high-dividend yields are seldom associated with significant growth opportunities. Equinix, however, disrupts this paradigm. By facilitating the critical infrastructure needed by cloud and tech companies, Equinix firmly anchors itself within a sector experiencing exponential growth. Moreover, as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), Equinix is obligated to distribute the majority of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends.\n\nThe company’s business model, focusing on providing essential infrastructure for digital and cloud services, aligns well with the ongoing shift towards online services and data-driven decision-making in businesses worldwide. As a REIT, Equinix combines growth potential with the obligation to return most of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, offering a balanced investment opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a global network of data centers located in key markets, Equinix benefits from a diverse and stable client base, reducing exposure to regional economic shifts. This international footprint ensures consistent demand for its services, supporting long-term growth and dividend sustainability. In the third quarter of 2023, Equinix declared a dividend of $3.41 per share, with total dividends paid from January to September 2023 reaching $10.23.\n\nInvesting in Equinix transcends mere participation in the real estate market; it offers a gateway to indirectly reap the benefits of the tech sector’s success. As digital transformation progresses, propelled by evolving consumer demands and technological innovation, Equinix’s role in this ecosystem is poised to become increasingly crucial, potentially bolstering its dividend outlook. This connection furnishes a persuasive argument for investors to consider Equinix as a means to diversify their portfolio and tap into the thriving tech and cloud computing domains.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc is partnering with Mexico fintech Kueski, which focuses on “buy now pay later options” and personal loans, to offer payments in bi-weekly installments in Latin America’s second-largest economy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTraders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts Musk Says First Human Patient Has Received Brain Implant Amazon Drops iRobot Deal; Roomba Maker Cuts 31% of Staff\n\nThe partnership marks the first time Amazon Mexico will allow users without a credit card to make purchases of up to 12 bi-weekly installments. Kueski will provide the financing for the purchases as well as determine the credit given to each user, said Andrew Seiz, the startup’s head of finance, in an interview.\n\n“It’s an exciting milestone, given Amazon is such a significant merchant in the context of Mexico,” he said. “With this agreement, people who may not have been able to access financing before will be able to purchase products in Amazon.”\n\nDelinquencies in Mexico so far “have been very controlled,” he added.\n\nMexico has emerged as a key market for financial services startups given that less than 50% of the population has a bank account. Some fintechs that offer high-yield savings accounts are competing with yields of 15%, above the central bank’s key rate of 11.25%.\n\nKueski raised a $202 million Series C round in December 2021 led by StepStone Group Inc and Victory Park Capital. The company is constantly in conversations with its existing investors, Seiz added, declining to give more details on future financing plans.\n\nKueski has been in operation for 12 years, but launched its BNPL area Kueski Pay three years ago. It currently has 620 employees and has granted nearly 15 million loans.\n\n“The outlook in Mexico is very robust, from a macroeconomic perspective and consumer demand for our product.” Seiz said. “So in the near term to medium term we believe Mexico offers a pretty significant opportunity for us and we will as a result continue to focus on Mexico for now.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Mexico Lender Kueski Raises $202 Million to Expand Operations\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Amazon’s failed iRobot deal is European regulators’ latest win in a yearslong campaign to stop Big Tech from getting bigger",
        "content": "Amazon couldn’t keep its acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot clean enough for European Union regulators.\n\nOn Monday, Amazon and iRobot, best known for making the Roomba, announced they were aborting their proposed $1.7 billion merger because there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union,” the two companies said in a joint statement.\n\nThey made no secret of their frustration at seeing the acquisition scuppered, saying they were “disappointed” by the outcome. Amazon added that by blocking the deal the EU would make it harder for a smaller company like iRobot to create new products and sell them at lower prices.\n\n“Mergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren’t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics,” Amazon senior vice president and general counsel David Zapolsky said in a press release. “Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition—the very things that regulators say they’re trying to protect.”\n\nAmazon will pay iRobot a $94 million termination fee as a result of the deal’s collapse, according to the Wall Street Journal. iRobot also announced it would lay off about 31% of its employees.\n\nThe EU cracks down on U.S. Big Tech\n\nThis isn’t Amazon or U.S. Big Tech’s first run-in with European regulators—in recent years the continent has taken a more active approach in curtailing the expansion of the industry’s most dominant companies.\n\nMany of the industry’s major players—such as Apple, Google, and Amazon—have come under scrutiny from top competition watchdog Margrethe Vestager for the outsize influence they wield in online marketplaces and the digital advertising business.\n\nTo go along with its newly exacting approach to individual companies, the EU also passed two sweeping pieces of legislation last year that were among the most robust in curbing tech’s influence. The Digital Services Act, meant to rein in the influence of powerful tech companies, gave Amazon a special designation of “very large online platform” that imposed added restrictions on which type of data it could use to target digital advertising. Along with the DSA came the Digital Markets Act, which governs online marketplaces, and which designated Amazon a “gatekeeper” and banned it from giving its own services preferential treatment when recommending products.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Fortune the DSA was meant to regulate large digital advertisers, while the majority of the company’s revenue comes from online retail sales. The spokesperson also noted that Amazon is not the largest retailer in any of the countries in which it operates, and said those unnamed retailers weren’t added to the list. Regarding the DMA, the spokesperson said Amazon will “continue to work constructively with the European Commission as we finalize our implementation plans.”\n\nA deal that seemed unlikely from the start\n\nAmazon’s proposed iRobot acquisition was in danger from the outset, with the EU formally launching an investigation in July. EU regulators expressed worries that after acquiring iRobot, Amazon might use its position as an online marketplace to harm other third-party sellers of remote vacuums that compete with the Roomba. It was also concerned that Amazon might unfairly restrict access for competitors to the Amazon Alexa interface that can be used to control a Roomba by issuing voice commands.\n\nBy the end of November, the EU had formally notified Amazon of its investigation’s findings. At the time, the European Commission communicated to Amazon that it would make a formal decision by Feb. 14, although that deadline is now moot, with the two companies voluntarily ending the agreement.\n\nMost of the EC’s crackdown on Big Tech is spearheaded by Vestager, the European commissioner for competition. In 2022, Vestager’s office reached a settlement with Amazon that forced the company to make changes to its business after previously allowing it to operate as both a seller and a marketplace, giving it an unfair advantage over other vendors on the site, according to regulators. Of particular concern at the time was use of nonpublic data collected from sellers using the platform that Amazon then used to gain a leg up on these merchants. As a result of the settlement Amazon avoided having to pay a fine.\n\nIn the past several years, Vestager and the EC have levied huge fines against tech’s biggest players. Google parent Alphabet was hit with a total of $9 billion in fines since 2017, including a single fine of about $5 billion, its largest ever penalty. The EC also scrutinized Facebook and WhatsApp owner Meta, for its role in facilitating online sales, arguing that tying access to its classified section, Facebook Marketplace, to a Facebook account, while also offering unfavorable digital ad rates to competitors, violated antitrust law. Meanwhile, Apple overhauled its App Store to comply with new EU regulations that would have otherwise risked seeing it banned from the continent entirely. \r\nEarlier this month Vestager came to the U.S. to visit several tech companies, including Alphabet and Apple.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Alphabet, Meta ad sales in Q4 unlikely to reflect gen AI investments",
        "content": "By Sheila Dang\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Despite the buzz over generative artificial intelligence last year, the technology's impact on the advertising business of Alphabet and Meta Platforms is likely to be muted when the companies report fourth-quarter results this week, though investors are mapping out its future potential.\n\nThe search giant has rolled out AI tools that help advertisers target audiences in a less costly way and decide how their marketing budgets should be distributed across Google's ad network. Facebook parent Meta is using generative AI to create different variations of ad campaigns.\n\nGenerative AI, which can create text and photos from prompts, is still in the \"hype cycle,\" Bernstein analysts said in a research note earlier this month, but added that investors were now looking for \"incremental use cases and revenue streams to spawn from these recent advancements.\"\n\nThe core business of digital advertising is expected to have been resilient in the quarter ended Dec. 31, and warnings that economic and geopolitical uncertainty could dampen the ad market are likely to prove overblown, the brokerage said in a separate note last week.\n\nMicrosoft, which is scheduled to report quarterly results on Tuesday, is likely to be the earliest winner in the nascent generative AI race, which has consumed nearly every tech and social media company from Amazon.com to Snap. For Microsoft, generative AI has fueled demand for its cloud services.\n\nAlphabet stock surged 58% last year, while Meta's stock nearly tripled. The broader S&P 500 index gained roughly a quarter in 2023, helped by an AI-fueled tech rally.\n\nGoing into 2024, \"an additional catalyst ... other than AI, will be the big focus on political advertising and will boost businesses at Meta and Google,\" said D.A. Davidson and Co analyst Gil Luria.\n\nSpending on political advertising in the U.S. will jump 30% this year from the last presidential election in 2020, partly driven by higher spending on digital platforms, research firm Insider Intelligence has estimated.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Tuesday, Google parent Alphabet is expected to report that fourth-quarter advertising revenue - its mainstay - grew 11.8% to $66 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nGoogle introduced its experimental AI chatbot Bard early last year and launched what it calls a search generative experience (SGE) that generates written responses to some Google Search queries.\n\nIt rolled out SGE to 120 countries in November, but the new search experience could have very little impact on its business in the near-term.\n\nBy 2025, SGE could account for between $35.6 million and $113 million in incremental search advertising revenue in the \"upside scenarios,\" said New Street Research analysts in a research report in October, adding that the biggest factor depends on how often people click on ads shown in AI-generated responses.\n\nAI POTENTIAL\n\nMeta, the second-largest digital ad platform, has already proven that its work in AI can produce results for its advertisers.\n\nIn a survey of advertisers who tested Meta's AI tools that can generate images and backgrounds for ads, half said they estimated the tools could save them at least five hours of work per week, Bernstein analysts said.\n\nAfter cautioning in October that the Israel-Hamas conflict could hurt ad spending, analysts estimate Meta will report $39.1 billion in fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday, at the higher end of Meta's guidance.\n\nA suite of AI tools that automatically finds potential customers and tests which ads will perform best is earning $10 billion on an annualized basis, Meta has said.\n\nIf the company introduces paid ads later this year within the AI assistants it recently launched to answer questions inside WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, it could generate $6.7 billion in ad revenue in 2025, New Street Research estimated.\n\nSuch ads could also be a much-needed boon for Snap, owner of photo messaging app Snapchat, which partnered with Microsoft in September to place sponsored product links in its chatbot called My AI.\n\nNew Street Research estimated Snap will earn $234 million this year from these links, which will grow to $686 million in 2025, or more than 11% of annual revenue. Analysts estimate Snap will report fourth-quarter revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5.7% from the previous year.\n\nAmazon.com, which will begin showing ads on its Prime Video service this week, is building partnerships for Amazon Bedrock, a service that lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, RBC Capital Markets said.\n\nThe launch of Prime Video ads could boost Amazon's ad revenue growth by 5% to 10%, RBC Capital Markets said in its 2024 outlook report. The retail giant reports results on Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin, Texas; Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Matthew Lewis)",

It witnessed record-breaking sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s expanding distribution network, Prime-enabled fast delivery, including Prime Free One Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery services and robust grocery services are expected to have aided the performance of its online retail business in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing worldwide e-commerce business, along with the expanding global footprint of Prime, is expected to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for online store sales is pegged at $68.53 billion, indicating growth of 6.2% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s aggressive stance on bolstering its physical presence is expected to have benefited the quarterly performance.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum across Amazon Fresh grocery stores, Whole Foods stores and Amazon Go outlets across the United States is anticipated to have contributed well to the company’s sales in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for the fourth quarter’s physical store sales is pegged at $5.31 billion, indicating growth of 7% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIn addition, strengthening relationships with third-party sellers might have remained a positive. The consensus mark for sales generated by third-party sellers is pegged at $41.5 billion, indicating growth of 14.1% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nComing to streaming services, solid momentum across Prime Video is anticipated to have been a major tailwind in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Expanding original content and overall content portfolios on Prime Video are likely to have accelerated Prime engagement.\r\n\r\nGains from the growing momentum across Amazon Music are expected to be reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter results.\r\n\r\nPrime benefits in retail as well as in online streaming fields might have continued aiding Amazon’s subscription revenue growth in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for subscription service sales is pegged at $10.4 billion, suggesting growth of 13.2% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS Portfolio Strength to Consider\n\nThe company’s expanding Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) portfolio is expected to have benefited the fourth quarter’s performance.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, AWS introduced a palm-based identity and a fully managed service called Amazon One Enterprise. The service offers accurate and secured enterprise access control through an easy-to-use biometric identification device.\r\n\r\nIt also unveiled a generative AI-powered chatbot, Amazon Q. The AI-powered assistant provides quick answers and helps in content creation and action-taking based on a customer's information repositories, code and enterprise systems.\r\n\r\nIt introduced four new capabilities for AWS Supply Chain - AWS Supply Chain Supply Planning, AWS Supply Chain N-Tier Visibility, AWS Supply Chain Sustainability and Amazon Q in AWS Supply Chain, designed to boost its existing data lake, demand planning and ML-powered insights.\r\n\r\nAWS’ introduction of AWS Graviton4 and AWS Trainium2, its next-generation two-chip families, might have contributed well.\r\n\r\nThe company also announced the general availability of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Express One Zone, a new high-performance, single-zone Amazon S3 storage class.\r\n\r\nIt unveiled new Amazon SageMaker capabilities for scaling with models, including SageMaker HyperPod, SageMaker Inference, SageMaker Clarify and SageMaker Canvas.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts are expected to have helped AWS win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS’s fourth-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark is pinned at $24.32 billion, up 13.8% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nSmart Device Portfolio to Consider\n\nAmazon’s robust Fire products family, portfolio of Echo smart speakers, Blink doorbells and eero products are expected to have continued benefiting its financial performance in the fourth quarter. Additionally, strengthening Alexa features is likely to have aided Amazon in delivering a better user experience, which, in turn, is expected to be reflected in the upcoming results.\r\n\r\nHowever, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds might have remained concerns.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Amazon this time around.

        "content": "Flutter has said it will make New York its primary listing in a blow to the London Stock Exchange - Hollie Adams/Bloomberg\n\nThe owner of Paddy Power is poised to quit the FTSE 100 and shift its main listing to New York, delivering a fresh blow to London’s struggling stock market.\n\nFlutter, which also owns PokerStars and Betfair, said on Monday it now sees the US as its “natural home” and will now work towards shifting its primary listing to New York.\n\nWhile it would retain a secondary share listing in London, the shift would likely make Flutter ineligible for inclusion on FTSE indexes.\n\nFlutter, which is worth £28.9bn, announced plans to pursue a secondary listing in the US last year and shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Monday.\n\nHowever, the company has upgraded its US ambitions following discussions with shareholders. Flutter will ask shareholders to vote on the plan at its AGM in May, with the move expected to take effect over the summer if it is approved.\n\nPeter Jackson, Flutter’s chief executive, said: “With our NYSE listing effective today, this is a pivotal moment for the group as we make Flutter more accessible to US based investors and gain access to deeper capital markets.”\n\nAs well as Flutter, Irish construction group CRH last year shifted from London to New York and the British stock market missed out on the $54bn initial public offering (IPO) of Cambridge-chipmaker Arm.\n\nThe number of requests to float on the London Stock Exchange’s main market has plunged to its lowest level in at least six years, according to Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) data, while the number of companies listed on the stock market has shrunk by more than 25pc over the last decade, according to research from trading platform XTB.\n\nFlutter is focusing on the US amid an explosion in gambling there spurred by a Supreme Court decision in 2018. The decision effectively ended a ban on sports betting at a federal level in every state but Nevada and has sparked a rapid expansion in the industry. US gambling revenues hit $16.2bn (£12.8bn) in the third quarter of 2023, according to the American Gaming Association.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it is best known for running the high street bookie Paddy Power in the UK, Flutter also owns a majority stake in FanDuel, one of the US’s biggest sports betting firms. The US accounts for around 40pc of its business and sales there grew by 38pc to £3.6bn in 2023.\n\nMr Jackson said: “We believe a US primary listing is the natural home for Flutter given FanDuel’s No. 1 position in the US, a market which we expect to contribute the largest proportion of profits in the near future.”\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:14 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

It now has over 40 aircraft and more than 5,000 staff.\n\nIn 2022, it posted a profit of $78.4m (£61.7m) on a turnover of $1.03bn (£812m).\n\nPeter Foster, chief executive, said that there had been strong investor interest in the flotation “supported by strong financial and operational track record, significant growth opportunities, and an experienced, disciplined management team”.\n\n05:30 PM GMT\n\nApple accuses Home Office of ‘unprecedented overreach’ in row over spying laws\n\nApple has accused the Home office of an “unprecedented overreach” in an escalating row over new spying laws, reports James Titcomb.\n\nThe iPhone maker said it was “deeply concerned” about changes to security legislation that would give the Home Secretary stronger powers over encrypted messaging apps.\r\n\r\nApple has previously warned that the legislation could lead to apps such as FaceTime and iMessage being removed from the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office is amending the Investigatory Powers Act, which gives the Government powers to force messaging apps to break encryption.\r\n\r\nThe new rules, branded a snooper’s charter by critics, will require tech companies to inform the Home Secretary before they make changes affecting apps’ security.\n\nThey would also allow the Government to secretly apply its powers to companies based overseas, which Apple said could prevent it from applying security updates around the world.\r\n\r\nIn a statement ahead of the final debate of the amended bill in the House of Lords on Tuesday, Apple said: “Protecting our users’ privacy and the security of their data is at the very heart of everything we do at Apple.\r\n\r\n“We’re deeply concerned that the proposed amendments to the Investigatory Powers Act now before Parliament place users’ privacy and security at risk.\r\n\r\n“It’s an unprecedented overreach by the government and, if enacted, the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.”\r\n\r\nApple and WhatsApp, which make the two most popular encrypted messaging apps, have warned that they would withdraw their services from the UK rather than comply with orders to weaken the protections.\r\n\r\nThe Government has made minor concessions on the new laws, but tech groups have continued to oppose the core changes to the legislation.\r\n\r\nThe third reading in the House of Lords on Tuesday will be followed by scrutiny in the Commons, although the legislation is likely to go through, given it is supported by the two major parties.\r\n\r\nA Government spokesperson said: “The first job of government is to keep the country safe and as technology advances and changes, so do the threats that the UK faces.\n\n“We have always been clear that we support technological innovation and private and secure communications technologies, including end-to-end encryption, but this cannot come at a cost to public safety.\n\n“It is critical that decisions about lawful access, which protect the country from child sexual abusers and terrorists, are taken by those who are democratically accountable and approved by Parliament.”\n\n05:06 PM GMT\n\nBrakes slam on new EU trade deal after farmer protests\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, has told the European Commission that it is impossible to conclude trade deal negotiations with South America’s Mercosur common market, Reuters has reported.\n\nFarmers have staged massive protests in France over the past few weeks, angry about rising costs and cheap imports, following similar action in other European countries, including Germany and Poland.\n\nFarmers in France have  objected to ongoing talks on a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur nations, which they say would allow cheap food imports that do not meet strict EU standards.\n\nPresident Macron “has very firmly reiterated to the Commission the fact it was impossible to conclude talks in these conditions,” a French presidential adviser told reporters in a briefing ahead of an EU summit on Thursday.\n\nThe adviser added that the EU understood it was impossible to reach a deal in this context and that EU talks with Mercosur countries had been stopped. He said:\n\nThe European Commission had understood it was impossible to reach a deal in this context. I think it has seen the situation in France, in Germany, in Poland, in the Netherlands, across Europe.\n\nIt is our understanding it has instructed its negotiators to put an end to the negotiation session underway in Brazil and in particular cancel the visit of the Commission’s vice-president that had been envisaged in view of a conclusion\n\n04:57 PM GMT\n\nFootsie closes down\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed down slightly by 0.03pc. The biggest riser was Fresnillo, the gold and silver mining company, which rose 9.98pc. It was followed by RS Group, which sells industrial components, which rose 2.76pc. The biggest faller was paper and packaging manufacturer Mondi, which fell 10.35pc, followed by telecoms company Airtel Africa, which fell 3.91pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 250 fell 0.14pc. The biggest risers were Hochschild Mining, up 8.70pc, followed by EasyJet, up 3.48pc. Telecom Plus, the owner of Utilty Warehouse, was the biggest faller, dropping 6.25pc, followed by Close Brothers, down 4.55pc.\n\n04:48 PM GMT\n\nFrench government plans further concessions as farmers continue to protest\n\nThe French government has told reporters that new measures to help farmers are coming, potentially tomorrow, after government efforts to defuse protests with promises of additional aid at the end of last week fell short.

The problem of youth vaping is a non-problem and the government is reacting to a moral panic it doesn’t understand.\n\n03:56 PM GMT\n\nBritain considers backing microchip technology favoured by China\n\nMinisters are considering supporting a microchip technology favoured by China and seen as a national security issue in the US. James Titcomb reports:\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology plans to canvas semiconductor companies about whether it should participate in developing a microchip design known as RISC-V.\n\nThe chip architecture, pronounced “risk five”, is attracting growing interest among technology businesses around the world but has been particularly welcomed in China as a potential way to blunt the effects of US chip sanctions.\n\nIt is developed as an “open” standard, meaning the technology is free to use and available to all, and so is not subject to US export rules.\n\nRISC-V is also seen as a growing threat to Arm, Britain’s biggest technology company, whose designs are predominantly used in the sort of low-energy microchips that RISC-V works on.\n\nRISC-V International has hundreds of members including major companies like Google and Intel. Its members also include the Chinese Academy of Sciences alongside tech companies such as Huawei.\n\nUS politicians have called on the White House to impose restrictions around RISC-V over concerns it could be used by Beijing.\n\nA group of Republican and Democrat Members of Congress wrote to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in November, saying: “While the benefits of open-source collaboration on RISC-V promise to be significant, it can only be realised when contributors are working with the sole aim of improving the technology, and not aiding the geopolitical interests of the PRC.”\n\nRISC-V International has pushed back on the calls. It said in October: “Contemplated actions by governments for an unprecedented restriction in open standards will have the consequence of diminished access to the global marketplace of products, solutions, and talent.”\n\nA Government spokesman said: “Semiconductors underpin our economy and national security, as well as being vital to our technology superpower ambitions. It is crucial we have a comprehensive understanding of the risks and benefits developments in this field pose to the UK, including in RISC-V.\n\n“Acknowledging that RISC-V’s open nature presents risks to manage around security, we have been clear in our Semiconductor Strategy, published in May last year, that it offers significant opportunities for innovation in the industry.” RISC-V is seen as a growing threat to Arm - Bloomberg\n\n03:50 PM GMT\n\nMarkets become less confident about US interest rate cuts\n\nThe dollar rose on Monday as investors prepared for the prospect that the Federal Reserve could push back against expectations of an imminent rate cut when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and amid doveish comments from two European central bankers.\n\nThe Fed is expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday and investors will focus on comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, after he indicated in December that the Fed is moving towards a programme of cutting interest rates.\n\nHelen Given, foreign exchange trader at Monex USA in Washington DC, said:\n\nThe [macroeconomic] picture in the US looks a lot better than the macro picture in European Union countries and the eurozone in general.\n\nWe’ll probably see a bit of pushback on the last meeting. I’d expect that a lot of the dollar strength that we’re seeing today, and we should continue to see until that decision release on Wednesday, is coming from shifting expectations.\n\n03:45 PM GMT\n\nEuro under pressure after doveish comments from central bankers\n\nThe euro has dropped slightly in trading today, down 0.37pc against the dollar and 0.20pc against the pound, after doveish comments from a couple of the European Central Bank’s governing council.\n\nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains:\n\nPortuguese ECB governing council member [Mario] Centeno said that rate cuts should start sooner rather than later so that the process is gradual, without any need to wait for wages data. His comments were followed by Slovakia member Peter Kazimir who argued that rate cuts were also on the horizon although his confidence over timing was less fixed, but that June was more likely than April.\n\n03:37 PM GMT\n\nBT accused of ripping off elderly landline customers in landmark court case\n\nBT has been accused of ripping off elderly landline customers in a landmark £1.3bn court case. James Warrington reports:\n\nThe telecoms giant is facing a class action lawsuit over claims it “systematically” overcharged around 3m customers – many of whom are elderly – on their landline bills.\n\nThe case, led by former Ofcom executive Justin Le Patourel, accuses BT of consistently increasing prices even as its own costs were falling.\n\nIf successful, affected customers could be owed damages of between £300 and £400.\n\nMr Le Patourel said: “We believe BT has been systematically overcharging millions of customers over many years, and those customers could be owed hundreds of pounds each.”\n\nThe first trial, which covers around 1.5m customers, began in the Competition Appeals Tribunal today.\n\nThe trial is expected to last eight weeks, with a judgement before the end of the year.\n\nThe legal action is centred on a 2017 Ofcom ruling, which found BT had been overcharging landline customers since 2009.\n\nThe former monopoly agreed to cut bills by £7 per month from April 2018, but did not compensate customers for past overcharging.\n\nThe first group in the class action lawsuit are “voice only” customers who had a BT landline service between October 2015 and April 2018.\n\nOfcom has previously said that these customers were more likely to be old, on low incomes or vulnerable.\n\nThe second group of around 2m customers had a BT landline service alongside broadband between October 2015 and December 2023, bundling these services together into a single, discounted package.\n\nMr Le Patourel said the case was particularly urgent given the age of many of the claimants. More than half a million affected customers have already passed away, though their estates will be entitled to apply for compensation if the case is successful.\n\nA spokesman for BT said: “We take our responsibilities to customers very seriously and are dedicated to keeping our customers connected, while helping those who need it most. This claim relates to a technical landline pricing issue which was resolved by Ofcom in 2017.\n\n“We do not accept that our pricing was anti-competitive back then, and as such are committed to robustly defending our position at trial.” A BT shop in London - Rasid Necati Aslim/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n03:35 PM GMT\n\nHanding over\n\nThat’s all from me today.

Buyer demand has risen 12pc with the biggest increase in London, of 21pc.\n\nAgreed sales have also increased across the country, up 13pc compared to the same time last year with sales rising in all regions.\n\nThis indicates buyers and sellers are more aligned on pricing, according to Zoopla.\n\nRichard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, said: “This improvement in activity will support sales volumes which, at one million, reached an eleven year low in 2023.”\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Labour and Tories risk reigniting debt crisis, warns top investor | Leading investment firm said the markets will be quick to punish financial recklessness\n\n2) Octopus in talks to help power Ukraine after Russia smashes grid | Energy company exploring use of pioneering software with Kyiv-based DTEK\n\n3) One in five young people take time off for mental health | Research by Prince’s Trust comes amid wave of long-term sickness striking Britain\n\n4) Xi curbs short selling after Chinese market plunges | Crackdown is latest attempt to prevent further falls in share prices\n\n5) Post Office scandal company to sell supermarket face-scanners | Fujitsu has developed technology that can check shoppers’ ages\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nChinese equities led a rally in Asian stocks to start the week, after regulators took new steps over the weekend to support the market.\n\nOil climbed after a step-up in Middle East violence, as a missile attack by Yemen’s Houthi group caused a fire on a fuel tanker in the Red Sea, while three US troops were killed after a drone attack in Jordan.\n\nThe dollar and US Treasury yields hovered in the middle of recent ranges ahead of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve policy meeting later in the week.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 1.4pc, and a sub-index of mainland property shares surged 3.6pc after China’s securities regulator said on Sunday that it will fully suspend the lending of restricted shares.\n\nRegional stocks had already started the day on a firm footing, but extended gains after the Hong Kong open, with South Korea’s Kospi advancing 1.2pc, while Australia’s stock benchmark added 0.4pc.\n\nTokyo stocks closed higher as investors cheered the strength of US shares after the Dow reached a fresh high.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8pc, or 275.87 points, to 36,026.94, while the broader Topix index added 1.3pc, or 31.83 points, to 2,529.48.",

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday as Wall Street looks for signs that the company’s vast artificial intelligence investments continue to pay off. Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft’s market capitalization over $3 trillion.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street expects Microsoft to post adjusted earnings per share of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a jump from the same quarter last year when the company posted an EPS of $2.32 on revenue of $52.7 billion.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure service, is expected to bring in $25.3 billion in the quarter, up from the $21.5 billion it generated in Q2 last year. Overall Microsoft Cloud revenue is estimated to top $32.2 billion, versus $27.1 billion last year. Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella during a press event at CES 2024. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) (Ethan Miller via Getty Images)\n\nOn the productivity side of things, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes revenue should top out at $19 billion, according to analyst estimates, up from $17 billion in Q2 last year.\n\nThe company’s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, is expected to generate $16.8 billion, up from $14.2 billion in the prior year.\n\nMicrosoft’s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\n\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot’s more advanced features.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year, as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\n\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and, in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\n\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently, as users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, it’s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it’s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.\n\nNow Microsoft and its ilk have to continue to prove the hype, and cash they spent, is worth it.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Amazon Drops iRobot Deal; Roomba Maker Cuts 31% of Staff",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has abandoned its planned $1.4 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after clashing with European Union regulators who had threatened to block the deal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTraders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts Evergrande Set for Liquidation as China Property Crisis Drags On Amazon Drops iRobot Deal; Roomba Maker Cuts 31% of Staff\n\nThe fallout came quickly. IRobot, which has been struggling recently, said Chief Executive Officer Colin Angle has stepped down as the company embarks on a restructuring plan that will result in about 350 job cuts, or 31% of the workforce. The vacuum maker’s shares tumbled 19% in New York to $13.80, their lowest level since 2009. Amazon’s shares were up less than 1% at $160.07.\n\nThe decision is a sign of the intense pressure Amazon is facing to prove its actions don’t harm competition as its influence grows in retail, cloud-computing and entertainment. Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have been keen to ensure that the biggest US tech companies don’t snap up innovative startups before they have a chance to become formidable competitors on their own.\n\nAmazon met with the FTC’s senior antitrust staff last week, who informed the company they were recommending a suit over the deal, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Executives and lawyers from the tech giant were scheduled to meet with the FTC’s three commissioners this week to make a final push for the acquisition, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing the confidential probe.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive arm that oversees antitrust, is generally known to opt for remedies that correct any risks to fair competition rather than ban mergers outright. But companies often short-circuit the process by choosing to abandon deals that appear to be headed for a veto.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s move, which comes with a $94 million termination fee to be paid to iRobot, follows a similar decision recently by Adobe Inc. to walk away from a planned $20 billion acquisition of startup Figma Inc. after locking horns with antitrust regulators in the EU and the UK.\n\nAmazon decided not to offer remedies to concerns flagged by regulators. The commission had earlier warned Amazon could be tempted to demote other robot vacuum cleaners on its platform and promote its own products with such labels as “Amazon’s choice” or “Works With Alexa.” The regulator also said Amazon may find it “economically profitable” to shut out rivals and had attempted to pressure Amazon into offering concessions in order to get the green light in Brussels, to no avail.\n\n“This outcome will deny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which we’re confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable,” said David Zapolsky, Amazon senior vice president and general counsel, in a statement. “Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition—the very things that regulators say they’re trying to protect.”\n\nWhile the company considered an appeal, that process was likely to take years, people familiar with the matter said, who asked not to be named discussing information that’s not public. The merger agreement expires this summer and the companies had already renegotiated the terms once.\n\n“Financially, this deal is immaterial to either sales or profit of Amazon,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Poonam Goyal said in a note Monday. But broadly speaking, she said, the termination “supports our view that large technology companies will have a tough time closing any acquisition given the current regulatory climates in the US and Europe.”\n\nThe breakup also spares Amazon the task of stemming the losses incurred by Bedford, Massachusetts-based iRobot, which has seen its fortunes sour in recent years. Last year iRobot was forced to secure a $200 million financing facility, and Amazon cut its per-share offer by about 15%.\n\nIRobot’s sales have fallen as pandemic-era home improvement splurges petered out. The company, which had been consistently profitable since its 2005 initial public offering, has racked up about $500 million in net losses since the second quarter of 2021. In a financial update on Monday, the company said it had an adjusted operating loss of about $200 million in 2023.\n\nRead More: Biden Antitrust Enforcers Set New Record for Merger Challenges\n\nAmazon, which builds the Alexa voice assistant and a wide range of home electronics, announced its intention to acquire iRobot in August 2022, a move that would have expanded its foothold in the burgeoning market for smart-home gadgets. The Seattle-based company has also developed its own home robotics franchise with Astro, a $1,600 home security bot it has started marketing as a business security guard.\n\nAmazon and iRobot have been close partners for years. The retailer has long been iRobot’s biggest customer, at times accounting for more than a quarter of sales (iRobot in 2021 stopped disclosing the identity of its biggest customer, which, during the most recently reported quarter, accounted for about 22% of revenue.) The vacuum maker, meanwhile, is a customer of the Amazon Web Services cloud-computing group, and has dispatched executives to speak at Amazon events.\n\nThe opposition to Amazon’s iRobot acquisition highlights the tension between Amazon’s retail operations and its ambitions for the smart-home ecosystem built around its Alexa voice assistant. The FTC has also expressed concern that the deal would give Amazon too much control over the smart-home device market and potentially violate users’ privacy by giving the company access to data on their homes.\n\nIn an apparent warning shot for Amazon’s future acquisition plans, the European Commission said it would keep a close eye on deals where “established sales channels acquire suppliers that are heavily dependent on the acquirer’s infrastructure and customer reach to be successful.”\n\nThough small for a company the size of Amazon, an iRobot acquisition would have been the fourth-biggest in its history, trailing only its purchases of Whole Foods Market, movie studio MGM and the One Medical concierge health-care service.\n\nRegulators in Europe and the US are increasingly skeptical of Big Tech’s dealmaking. In September, the EU regulator nixed Booking Holdings Inc.’s €1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) bid for Sweden’s Etraveli Group and the bloc is in the very early stages of looking into Microsoft Corp.’s partnership with OpenAI. In the US, the Biden administration set a record for merger challenges.\n\n(Updates with statement from European Commission)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Nasdaq 100’s Hidden Gems: 7 Tech Stock Bargains Ready to Boom",
        "content": "Coming off a year where the Nasdaq 100 gained 55%, you wouldn’t expect there to be many Nasdaq 100 tech bargains, let alone the index to have a repeat performance in 2024. Yet, the technology-laden benchmark is leading the way again a month into the new year. It’s up over 3% so far in January, which would lead to another annual gain of about 45% if it maintained that pace!\n\nOf course, it’s unrealistic to expect the market to keep growing like that. For example, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) just offered near-term guidance that cut the knees out of its stock, and other chipmakers sympathized. Semiconductor stocks had been among the best performers last year. You can expect continued volatility in the sector and other markets, too.\n\nEven so, while the index is still near its all-time highs, Nasdaq 100 tech bargains are available. What follows are the seven best opportunities to cash in on future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: Cisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe reason Intel’s guidance sucked was because companies are rushing headlong into artificial intelligence (AI) data center chips and away from standard processors. While Intel is late to the game, those same forces are exactly why Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is taking off. Shares are up 10% over the past few months. I see that as only the beginning.\n\nCisco sees massive orders piling up for its AI-based Ethernet architecture that runs under the GPU architecture. CEO Chuck Robbins sees $1 billion in order flow coming in fiscal year 2025, or twice as much as previously predicted. That’s because that’s when the Ethernet buildout will really take off. Cisco already has its Ethernet fabric deployed at three major hyperscalers. The world’s four largest hyperscale platforms are Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Together, they account for around 78% of total capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco also works with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and even Intel to develop Ethernet technologies for GPU-enabled infrastructure. That makes the networking hardware leader part of this tightly-knit growth industry that shows no sign of letting up.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe ongoing buildout of the cloud also means the data transitioning from brick-and-mortar data centers needs protection. Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government organizations. And it’s not just with the underlying architecture where AI plays a leading role. Next-generation data and app security driven by AI tools is in high demand. After two disappointing quarters, though, Fortinet is growing again.\n\nMuch of the cybersecurity specialist’s business was centered around hardware-based firewalls monitoring traffic for physical data centers. As we said before, enterprise spending was moving to the cloud. But Fortinet has heavily invested in AI, and its secure access service edge (SASE) offerings are expanding. Fortinet says SASE is a $17 billion market growing at a 20% compounded annual rate and is expected to hit $36 billion by 2027. It sees continued momentum of its SASE solutions that were adopted by internet providers, including AT&T (NYSE:T), British Telecom (OTCMKTS:BTGOF), Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), and others.\n\nFTNT stock is up 50% from the lows it hit after earnings, but more growth will come.\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: Lam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe pell-mell rush into AI chips also boosts Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), the premier manufacturer of specialized semiconductor equipment. Its etch and deposition tools allow for more sophisticated chips and advanced packaging techniques that AI requires. Etching is the selective removal of film and material from a wafer to create features customers want.\n\nThis is another tremendous growth opportunity because of the new chip design technology under development. Called gate-all-around (GAA), manufacturers can have material on all four sides of a transistor instead of three. It could greatly increase chip speed and efficiency.\n\nLam Research sees it as alone being a $1 billion opportunity. As Lam is one of the few equipment manufacturers that could handle such an increase, it can reap the benefits. It is already approaching a 75% market share in the space.\n\nSales and profits are growing, as its recently released earnings report indicated. Yet, trading at only 23 times next year’s earnings estimates is a bargain stock to buy.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is also cashing in on the demand for cybersecurity products. Unlike Fortinet, however, it has been hitting the mark each quarter. Its stock is up 115% over the last 12 months and is 16% higher so far this year. Sales and profits are on a rocket-ride higher with earnings increasing 10-fold year over year last quarter.\n\nDriving this performance is its new AI-powered Cortex platform (I’m sensing a theme with what makes a business successful these days). Cortex now has 5,300 customers, up 25%, and it was the first to achieve 100% detection and prevention from cyberattacks in industry-standard testing.\n\nWhat sets Palo Alto Networks apart from the crowded cybersecurity field is its agnostic approach to protection. It offers SASE products, cloud, on-site, hybrid protection solutions, next-gen firewalls, and more. By giving the customer what it wants, it has met the broadest needs of the market. With Wall Street expecting earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years, Palo Alto Networks should record a sonic boom in growth.\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: ASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLike Lam Research, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) offers specialized semiconductor equipment for AI chip production. It differs from the competition because it has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. It is the world’s only manufacturer of the machines needed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel, Samsung, and other chipmakers.\n\nThese machines are not exactly mass-produced either. It built just 345 lithography systems last year, 81 immersion systems, and only 40 EUV machines. But what it lacks in volume, ASML makes up for in price. The EUV equipment, for example, goes for around $200 million a pop.\n\nYet ASML is in the process of further cementing its dominance by developing next-generation high-numerical aperture (high-NA) lithography systems. These will allow its customers to produce even smaller chips. They’re also not bargain-basement priced. These next-gen machines sell for about $300 million each. It shipped the first one to Intel in December.\n\nThat’s why the stock is still undervalued despite ASML stock trading at an all-time high. It already enjoys rich profit margins, and analysts forecast it will grow earnings 24% annually for the next five years.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facade\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe ongoing 5G infrastructure rollout is arguably the biggest driver of future growth for telecom giant T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). It marks the first major upgrade to the country’s telecom infrastructure, allowing greater download speeds. Because data consumption is the biggest profit center for telecoms, the upgrade will help boost earnings further. The analysts at PwC forecast global data consumption over telecom networks will grow nearly three-fold from 3.4 million petabytes (PB) in 2022 to 9.7 million PB in 2027.\n\nT-Mobile stands to benefit the most as it recently became the largest U.S. wireless carrier, edging out Verizon (NYSE:VZ). It recorded 21.6 million prepaid users, while its rival slipped to 21.4 million.\n\nI’ve noted before Wall Street forecasts T-Mobile will enjoy an incredible run-up in earnings over the next few years. Analysts estimate profits will expand 43% a year in the long term. At that rate, the stock trades at just a tiny fraction of that growth rate. Investors can expect explosive gains to continue.\n\nRoper Technologies (ROP) Image of Roper Technologies logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) is arguably one of the most under-the-radar technology stocks. It plies its trade in application software, network software, and tech-enabled products, giving it broad market coverage. It’s not flashy like other tech stocks, but it says it is the leader in most markets in which it operates. At the same time, no single competitor competes with it over many product lines. It’s the jack-of-all-trades of tech stocks.\n\nYet Roper still mastered growth. Over the past three decades, Roper Technologies generated total returns of over 33,200%. In contrast, the S&P 500 managed just 2,100% returns. It’s up 24% in the past year and just plods on, growing year after year.\n\nWall Street expects long-term earnings growth to triple compared to the last five years. It pursues a growth-by-acquisition strategy, buying asset-light, cash-generating businesses. It then reinvests this excess cash in businesses seeking incrementally higher rates of return.\n\nRoper Technologies has a decades-long track record of success and seems equally prepared for decades of growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T stock.

        "title": "One chart shows why Big Tech earnings are critical for the health of the market rally",
        "content": "The stock market is still all about tech.\n\nNew data from FactSet shows that while strategists have called for a broadening out of the market rally, big tech companies are expected to be the drivers of Q4 earnings growth in the S&P 500.\n\nEarnings for Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to grow a combined 53.7% in the fourth quarter. The other 494 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see a 10.5% decline.\n\nFive of those companies —Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta — are set to report quarterly results this week.\n\nAfter the remaining Magnificent Seven tech stock, Tesla (TSLA), disappointed with its report, Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nThe expectations for some names are massive. Nvidia is expected to grow earnings per share by more than 400% compared to the same period a year prior. Analysts project Meta's earnings per share to grow 175% from the same period a year prior.\n\nThe eye-popping growth for some of the largest stocks in the market is expected to continue next quarter, too. A second chart from FactSet shows that Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are expected to grow earnings by nearly 80% in the first quarter of 2024. The other 496 companies, including Apple Microsoft and Tesla, are expected to grow earnings by a combined 0.3%.\n\n\"Their earnings are incredible compared to the rest of the market,\" JJ Kinahan, IG North America's CEO told Yahoo Finance Live. \"You don't often see this where a few stocks are so outperforming the rest of the market.\"\n\nTo some on Wall Street, these massive earnings expectations help explain why the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs and still might not be overvalued.\n\n\"There's more growth in that [S&P 500] valuation now than there used to be,\" Pettit said, nodding to the increased position of technology in the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the market's recent rally, nearly 90% of the growth seen in January has also been driven by the same tech companies excluding Tesla, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. This comes after the seven tech companies were the major market driver in 2023, and it creates a simple reason for why investors will be watching these reports closely.\n\nStill tech earnings expectations go beyond just the quarterly numbers. It's about updates on various market-moving narratives during earnings calls, too.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been at the center of earnings improvements for Meta and Nvidia. Microsoft and Amazon both have AI plays, too, but their cloud revenues are typically more closely scrutinized. Additionally, Apple's products business can provide a lens into demand for hardware and the overall state of consumer spending.\n\nAll of this combines to make tech earnings crucial for the market — not only because people expect Big Tech to do well but because if their results miss estimates, the lagging parts of their business could be a flashing a warning sign about an economic slowdown.

Its market capitalization is about $14.5 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNo Apple Car?\n\nIn a memo released as he left, Novotney said, “Apple has been my life.” He worked on a variety of products at the company, including the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Watch.\n\nNovotney is the second Apple Car executive this month to leave for Rivian, a start-up with ties to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Earlier, Jonas Reinke, who had been with Apple for four years, joined Rivian as vice president of product management. Reinke will now work on Rivian’s in-car software. Rivian bought a Swedish route-planning company, Iternio, last year.\n\nThe executive moves may say more about Apple than Rivian. The Apple Car was originally expected to be released this year. Then, it was 2026. Now, that date has recently been moved back to 2028.\n\nApple is the second Cloud Czar to move away from the auto sector. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) went through three layoffs at its Waymo division last year.\n\nThe movement toward self-driving cars has taken numerous hits lately. Accidents have led to General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) Cruise unit being investigated by several federal agencies.\n\nRivian is best known for its high-end R1T truck and 100,000-unit Amazon delivery van contract. Scaringe said last week he is trying to expand the product line. The company is focusing that effort on a Georgia factory that is due for completion in 2026.\n\nRIVN Stock: What Happens Next?\n\nDrivers should keep both hands on the wheel. Investors might want to keep both hands in their pockets as the electric vehicle (EV) shakeout continues.

        "title": "It's Jobs Week Already? Plus Q4 Reports from MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN",
        "content": "Who says January’s a long month? This week starts slow, but we’ll end it with a full-fledged Jobs Week for February. Tuesday ushers in new JOLTS data for December, Wednesday brings us private-sector ADP ADP payroll totals for this month (along with the latest Fed decision on interest rates), and Friday is the big non-farm payroll survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). All of the forecast numbers are expected to tick down in the labor market, aside from the Unemployment Rate, which is expected to lift back up slightly to 3.8%.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our new week also features several marquee names of the Tech industry reporting earnings: Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL on Tuesday, Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN on Thursday — all after the closing bell, as per normal. These major firms are all expecting growth on both top and bottom lines, year over year, led by anticipated earnings growth of +285% from Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Amazon, and +15% revenues growth year over year from Zacks Rank #2-rated Microsoft. (In other news, Amazon is no longer pursuing the acquisition for iRobot, citing antitrust issues, sending the smaller stock down -20% at this hour.)\r\n\r\nElsewhere, there will be a bevy of other reports hitting the tape this week, from Case-Shiller home prices to Consumer Confidence to Q4 Productivity to S&P and ISM Manufacturing. We also look for fresh Q4 earnings reports from across the spectrum of sectors, from AMD AMD to General Motors GM to Mondelez MDLZ to Pfizer PFE to Snapchat SNAP and Starbucks SBUX — and that’s just tomorrow!\r\n\r\nOff near-term lows on January 18th, three of the four major stock market indices have rebounded into positive territory year-to-date. Only the Russell 2000 is still -3% from the start of this year’s trading, though that’s up from -6% on January 18th. The small-cap index, heavy in regional bank representation, needs three relatively strong trading days to finish the month in the green, along with the others which are already there.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision to be any factor at all on trading behavior this week. Even among those analysts who still believe — or wish for — six interest rate cuts between now and the end of the year do not foresee one coming this early. Most of these folks look toward early March for the first cut, though this would likely take much weaker numbers in the economy before the Fed would risk loosening the monetary screws.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "AI’s path in 2024: Another year of growth instead of monetization",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence has captured the world’s imagination, but for 2024, investors shouldn’t expect to see much in the way of financial tailwinds yet — outside a couple of exceptions to the rule.\n\nDirect monetization of AI services will remain out of reach for most companies, Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance. While businesses are ramping up their AI usage, software makers will likely include AI features as a perk of their existing offerings or as a way to prompt upgrades instead of a paid standalone product.\n\n“The tools built around generative AI are compelling, but they are in their infancy. They're still working out the kinks,” said Luria. “The inclination from companies … will be to bundle these offerings in order to drive adoption, so we're still probably a little bit farther away from being a material growth driver.”\n\nTell that to investors who have become enthralled with the AI trade.\n\nSoftware ETF IGV is up roughly 50% over the past year, compared to a 34% gain for the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and 20% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). The outsized performance is mostly driven by AI excitement, said Luria. \"We believe most software companies will face a headwind to their stocks if they don't deliver tangible AI results [this year].\"\n\nMicrosoft still leads the industry, Salesforce well positioned\n\nThe outliers are Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) — both D.A. Davidson’s top picks for mega caps due to their advanced AI abilities and solid businesses outside of the field.\n\nAdobe, a leader in text-to-image generation, has incorporated generative AI features across its creative suites, with a generative AI credits system that entices users to pay more to use those functions. Executive Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Corporation, Satya Nadella, speaks during a talk about Microsoft's vision for AI at Chatham House, in London, Britain, January 15, 2024. REUTERS/Anna Gordon (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMicrosoft, with its Copilot services, is charging users extra for accessing the AI assistants embedded within Microsoft 365, GitHub, and more.\n\nBut the real AI cash cow will remain its cloud service, Azure, which provides access to OpenAI's and others' large language models (LLMs) that developers can use to build their own applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile monetization might not come right away, software that aids client-facing roles is well positioned for the future. Generative AI’s potential has been touted as almost limitless, but the proven use cases currently focus on text generation, text summation, and text-to-image generation, per Luria.\n\nThese use cases are most relevant in tasks like pre-populating emails, summarizing calls, and answering common questions — all functions built into Salesforce’s (CRM) AI assistant, Einstein Copilot, which is targeting the end of February for a public launch.\n\nMorgan Stanley recently upgraded the company's stock to a top pick, citing its consistent revenue growth and relatively muted trading multiples compared to its peers.\n\nData is worth gold in the AI age, so investors should look for firms that lead the field in data access and integration. Salesforce, for example, already hosts a wealth of data from companies using its products to automate customer service, marketing, and other tasks.\n\nIn December, the enterprise SaaS giant announced a new capability to import unstructured data — think emails and phone calls instead of entries in databases — into its Data Cloud product, which connects data from its various software offerings.\n\nMore data is the solution to hallucinations, or false answers.\n\n“One of the most common ways to improve a hallucination or prevent a hallucination is to provide more context,” Patrick Stokes, executive vice president of product and industries marketing at Salesforce, told Yahoo Finance. “If we can connect the business context into the prompt, the LLM now has the additional information it needs.”\n\nThe future: Smaller models, bots talking to bots\n\nThough large, universal knowledge models like ChatGPT grab all the attention, companies pioneering more efficient models will be the ones raking in the cash. Workers at lamp makers don’t need help drafting emails about the Roman Empire. Smaller models containing only the pertinent information would cost less to operate — and thus, easier for businesses to profit from. Such efforts are underway at Microsoft and Salesforce, among others.\n\n“We learned that the company has recently formed an internal team to develop smaller AI models (SLMs) to make AI cheaper to run and seemingly reduce dependencies on OpenAI. These SLMs, such as Phi-2 and Kosmos-2 are intended to rival performance of larger models with significantly fewer parameters,” Citi analysts wrote after attending Microsoft’s AI tour last week.\n\nWhat’s in enterprise AI’s future? One day soon, we may see bots talking to bots — an AI assistant managing your calendar collaborating with an AI assistant handling your client information — as platforms become more interoperable.\n\n“It's like the assistants start helping each other to help the end user,” predicted Nick Johnson, Salesforce’s senior vice president of strategic partnerships.\n\nIf these assistants can program profits for their masters, investors would be all the better.\n\nJennifer Wang is a senior editor at Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Amazon terminates iRobot deal, sees 'no path' to EU approval",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is ending its bid to acquire Roomba-maker iRobot (IRBT). The companies say they see \"no path to regulatory approval in the European Union.\" As a result of the deal being canceled, iRobot has announced it is cutting 350 jobs, about 31% of its workforce, and that Chairman and CEO Colin Angle will be stepping down.\n\nYahoo Finance Live reports the breaking details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- All right, well shares of iRobot sinking in premarket trading as Amazon announces that it will not move forward with its acquisition of the vacuum maker. Now they are saying that they see no path for regulatory approval. More bad news here, iRobot. Take a look at those shares, off about 19% ahead of the open. And also, the fact that it is cutting 31% of its staff as its chair and CEO, saying that he will step down immediately.\n\nLots to unpack here, but Brad, let's first start with the Amazon angle of this because the fact that they are abandoning this $1.4 billion acquisition coming after the deal was pressured from the EU. But I think more so just what this signals more broadly in terms of Amazon needing to defend the fact that it's not a monopoly, that it should be able to get approval for these sort of deals and what this could mean for other M&A activity beyond Amazon but talking about some of those other larger tech names, which has been under pressure now, not only in the EU but also here in the US with the FTC.\n\n- Right, and an uncertain future now here for iRobot, especially with some of the restructuring plans that the company has announced as well on the back of it, undertaking the operational restructuring plan, trying to align cost structure with near term revenue expectations, and to drive profitability is what they say. They're reducing some of their research and development expenses by approximately $20 million year over year. They're also looking to have some margin improvements in generation of approximately $80 to $100 million in savings, not necessarily money that they're going to see just flow in terms of profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd so that brings you to the larger question as of what their profit base will actually look like, and then you mentioned the restructuring impacting the employees here, 350 employees, 31% of the company's workforce as of December 2023. A lot of those notifications are going to be taking place unfortunately by the end of March.\n\n- Yeah, certainly, so it's going to likely be under pressure a little bit. And then just going back also just in terms of Amazon, the fact that it needs to prove that some of its actions is not stifling competition elsewhere, that's going to remain a topic here as you look forward to what these big tech giants are going to look like here in several years.\n\n- Absolutely.",

        "content": "Big Tech is next up at bat to report earnings this week, mainly five of the Magnificent Seven components — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nYahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer explains market commentary on projected earnings growth for these mega-cap tech companies.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- And tech is on deck this week. Some of the stock market's largest technology companies set to report earnings. And for more on how the reports may impact markets, we've got Yahoo Finance's very own Josh Schafer to help us give the rundown for the week ahead.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad. So you take a look at that list we just showed five of the so-called Magnificent Seven. And when you think about Tesla's performance a week ago, maybe we're talking more of a Super Six here and not a Magnificent Seven. So really, you're only missing NVIDIA in terms of massive tech companies to report this week.\n\nAnd really, guys, I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market and the fundamental story that we're seeing in the stock market. So when you take a look at the earnings projections for the six companies-- I'm going to say six here because we're including NVIDIA in the graphic that we're showing, but they're projected to grow earnings-- this is data from FactSet-- at nearly 54% year over year for the fourth quarter.\n\nLook at the other 494 companies. They're expected to have earnings fall 10.5%. So when you think about why stocks move higher and what people are buying, you're buying earnings, right? You want earnings to eventually go up. That is the story of the stock market in the long term. And that's why the short-term story of the stock market has really just been these six stocks. This is what we're waiting for. This is what we-- this is the big moment.\n\nStory continues\n\n- This is what we're waiting for. It's a big moment. And then you pair that also with the jobs data that we're going to be getting out on Friday, the Fed decision on Wednesday. I know you closely are following that as well, Josh.\n\nIn terms of investors' view on this, in terms of the big driver of the market or the key thing that traders are going to be listening for obviously a lot of that's going to be surrounding the timing of that first cut. But beyond that, what do you think has the potential to move the markets this week?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. I mean, it seems like overall, we're still in the soft landing is probably consensus and probably to the upside, right, as far as what people are expecting. So anything that doesn't give us that, when you're thinking maybe a really cool jobs report, perhaps the Fed talking about cutting later than people think or being more restrictive than people think, or I do think the fundamental earnings story from tech because of where the overall S&P is at right now.\n\nI did a story over the weekend about the S&P being potentially overvalued and what strategists say about that. Well, they talk about if you really think about what's in the S&P, you're buying future earnings growth, right? And if you get that earnings growth from these big companies, then one could argue the S&P 500 at a record high isn't overvalued, and it has room to keep growing.\n\nSo you get all three aspects this week, right? We talk about the Fed a lot. That can move your major indexes and move things. We talked about the Mag Seven. We're getting that. And we've got a jobs report on Friday because why not?\n\n- So I guess we'll talk on Friday, and we'll decide what the biggest mover was of the week.\n\n- Certainly setting up to be a very busy week here potentially for the markets. Josh, great stuff. Thanks so much.",

        "title": "Unlocking Q4 Potential of Amazon (AMZN): Exploring Wall Street Estimates for Key Metrics",
        "content": "In its upcoming report, Amazon (AMZN) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share, reflecting an increase of 285.7% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $166.26 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 11.4%.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been adjusted upward by 2.8% to its current level. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Amazon metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net Sales- AWS' to reach $24.32 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +13.8%.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net sales- Physical stores' reaching $5.31 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +7% year over year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net sales- Online stores' will reach $68.53 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +6.2% year over year.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Net Sales- Subscription services' will likely reach $10.40 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- North America' will reach $103.28 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Advertising services' should come in at $14.07 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +21.7% year over year.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Geographic Revenue - International' of $38.36 billion.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $160.72 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 4.7% since the start of the year compared to the 29.7% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 58.3% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 26, 2023, Amazon reported EPS of $0.85 versus consensus estimate of $0.58.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $3.66 per share on $571.07 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.73 per share on $636.82 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 35.54% and 11.51%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nAmazon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nAmazon has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 43.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 19.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 33.1X versus its peer group's average of 15.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Amazon shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nHow Does AMZN Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of AMZN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI). MELI has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. MercadoLibre, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 22.39%, and for the current fiscal year, MELI is expected to post earnings of $35.14 per share on revenue of $14.34 billion.\n\nShares of MercadoLibre, Inc. have gained 14.3% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 51.1X and a P/CF of 102.06X.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is in the top 43% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AMZN and MELI, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "UPDATE 2-Amazon, iRobot abandon merger in face of EU opposition",
        "content": "(Adds more on Amazon antitrust record, iRobot earnings, restructuring)\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Amazon and robot vacuum maker iRobot said Monday they would end their plans to merge in the face of opposition from EU antitrust regulators.\n\niRobot announced a significant restructuring plan to reduce costs and said it would cut about 31% of its workforce, or 350 jobs. The company also said founder Colin Angle has stepped down as its CEO.\n\nAngle said given the current challenges, he and the board \"mutually decided that iRobot will be better served by a new leader with turnaround experience.\" Amazon said its proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of iRobot had no path to regulatory approval in the European Union. Reuters reported earlier this month the deal would be blocked by European Commission antitrust regulators and that its main concerns were that Amazon may thwart iRobot rivals on its online marketplace, especially in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\n\nAmazon announced the deal in August 2022. The world's largest online retailer, which already owns Alexa and Ring, was pushing to expand its stable of smart home devices as well as expanding the e-commerce giant's virtual healthcare.\n\n\"We're disappointed that Amazon's acquisition of iRobot could not proceed,\" said David Zapolsky, Amazon's general counsel. \"We're believers in the future of consumer robotics in the home and have always been fans of iRobot's products,\" he added in a statement.\n\nBedford, Massachusetts-based iRobot said it expects to report full-year 2023 revenue of $891 million, a 25% reduction and a loss of between $265 and $285 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Amazon will pay iRobot a $94 million termination fee.\n\nAmazon has had a mixed record with competition regulators in recent years, completing a deal for healthcare provider One Medical and MGM's movie catalogue.\n\nBut it faces a lengthy court battle in a Seattle federal court with the FTC over accusations the company uses illegal strategies to boost profits at its online retail empire, including an algorithm that allegedly pushed up prices by more than $1 billion.\n\niRobot shares fell 18.5% in trading Monday before the market opened. Since first reports the deal might be blocked by EU regulators two weeks ago, iRobot shares have fallen by half.\n\nCritics opposed the deal, saying it would strengthen Amazon.com's already powerful position in smart home devices.

        "title": "Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 29, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\n\nBig Tech Earnings Loom: What Can Investors Expect?\n\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\n\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\n\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\n\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\n\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\n\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\n\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\n\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\n\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\n\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\n\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\n\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

        "content": "Amazon’s proposed acquisition of iRobot has no path to regulatory approval in the European Union, preventing Amazon and iRobot from moving forward together—a loss for consumers, competition, and innovation.\n\nSEATTLE & BEDFORD, Mass., January 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT) announced that they have entered into a mutual agreement to terminate their previously announced acquisition agreement, originally signed on August 4, 2022, under which Amazon would have acquired iRobot for cash consideration. This deal would have allowed Amazon to invest in continued innovation by iRobot and support iRobot in lowering prices on products customers already love. The companies released the following statements today about the decision:\n\n\"We’re disappointed that Amazon’s acquisition of iRobot could not proceed,\" said David Zapolsky, Amazon SVP and General Counsel. \"We’re believers in the future of consumer robotics in the home and have always been fans of iRobot’s products, which delight consumers and solve problems in ways that improve their lives. Amazon and iRobot were excited to see what our teams could build together, and we’re deeply grateful to everyone who worked tirelessly to try and make this collaboration a reality. This outcome will deny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which we’re confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable. Mergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren’t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics. Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition—the very things that regulators say they’re trying to protect.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"iRobot is an innovation pioneer with a clear vision to make consumer robots a reality,\" said Colin Angle, Founder of iRobot. \"The termination of the agreement with Amazon is disappointing, but iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better, and that our customers around the world love.\"\n\nThe companies have signed a termination agreement that resolves all outstanding matters from the transaction, including Amazon paying iRobot the previously agreed upon termination fee.\n\nAbout Amazon\n\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth’s Best Employer, and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 47% of His Portfolio Invested in 5 Superb Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper runs Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993, and has long been one of the brightest stars on Wall Street. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,\" by Forbes. Tepper has \"consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa's] inception,\" according to Tepper's bio posted by Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nOver the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by 15%, no small feat, given the macroeconomic backdrop. His strong track record suggests that Tepper's stock picks might be worth further review. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors might be surprised to discover that, to close out the third quarter, Tepper had a whopping 47.1% of Appaloosa's portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 11.6% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 10.2% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 9.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 8.8% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 7.2%\n\nLet's take a look at Tepper's five top picks to see why he's so heavily weighted toward these AI stocks.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms might seem a surprising choice, but the company has a long history of using AI to bolster its business. The vast majority of Meta's revenue comes from digital advertising, and AI can more accurately surface relevant ads and other content on its social media sites.\n\nAs the world's second-largest digital advertiser, the recent rebound in ad spending has bolstered the company's fortunes. Meta has also released several AI-powered tools to help advertisers more accurately connect with their target market. Perhaps as importantly, the company developed a leading open-source AI model -- Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud infrastructure platforms, resulting in an entirely new revenue stream for the company.\n\nAt just 20 times forward earnings, Meta is selling at a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Tepper's investing decision.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft saw the writing on the wall and invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the past few years, helping spotlight the potential for generative AI. Its big tech rivals quickly follow suit, kicking demand for AI into overdrive. The tech giant answered the growing demand by infusing AI functionality across a broad swath of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. Furthermore, all the most popular AI models are available on Azure Cloud.\n\nThe biggest coup, however, was the debut of Microsoft Copilot, its AI assistant. Its ability to increase user productivity has generated strong demand and could produce incremental revenue of up to $100 billion by 2027, according to analyst calculations. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the third quarter, and Microsoft pointed out that three percentage points of that growth was the result of growing demand for AI.\n\nMicrosoft is currently trading for 31 times forward earnings. While that's a slight premium to the market, the company's strong legacy businesses and the opportunity afforded by AI make Microsoft a bargain at this price, which likely didn't escape Tepper's notice.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nWhile some viewed Amazon as slow out of the gate, it has jumped into the AI opportunity with both feet. The company has long used AI to handle product recommendations, inventory levels, delivery routes, and more.\n\nYet that's just the beginning of Amazon's AI opportunity. The company is now using generative AI to improve product listings, generate review summaries, and refine advertising. It also is working on an AI-powered tool that can answer questions about specific products.\n\nThere's more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a growing list of popular generative AI models, including a few of its own via its Bedrock AI. The company has also unveiled several AI-centric chips, including Inferentia and Trainium, designed to speed AI processing for AWS customers.\n\nDespite its strong recovery last year, Amazon is still selling for just 2 times forward sales, the standard for an underpriced stock, which likely piqued Tepper's interest.\n\n4. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion about AI stocks would be complete without a nod to Nvidia, a point highlighted by Tepper's position. Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized gaming and are the gold standard for AI applications.\n\nNvidia's processors have cornered the market in both data centers and machine learning, with an estimated 95% share in each. Experience in the field helped Nvidia quickly pivot to address the growing demand for generative AI.\n\nCompetitors are scrambling to develop competing processors, but Nvidia continues to maintain its edge. For the nine months ended Oct. 29, 2023, Nvidia spent $6.2 billion, or 16% of its total revenue, on research and development. The company's track record of continuing innovation will make it difficult to supplant.\n\nDespite the stock's recent run, Nvidia is still remarkably cheap, sporting a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- that benchmark for an undervalued stock -- of which Tepper was no doubt keenly aware.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Alphabet makes the lion's share of its revenue from digital advertising, in this case fueled by Google Search. The company has an impressive track record of deploying AI to improve its search algorithms and ad targeting, and the recovering ad market will no doubt improve the company's results.\n\nAlphabet didn't sleep on the potential of generative AI. The company integrated AI functionality into many of its flagship Google and Android products. As one of the Big Three cloud providers, it was able to expand the number of AI systems available to its Google Cloud customers.\n\nIts most recent offering, Gemini AI, is being hailed by the company as its \"largest and most capable AI model,\" outperforming rivals using a variety of widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, Alphabet's Vertex AI provides access to 130 foundational AI models with something for just about every use case.\n\nThe company's rebound over the past year notwithstanding, Alphabet still sells for just 19 times forward earnings, a valuation that Tepper likely couldn't pass up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "My Top FAANG Stock to Buy for the First Half of 2024 (and Beyond)",
        "content": "If you've owned any of the market's so-called FAANG stocks -- the elite group of big-tech companies -- for any meaningful stretch of time during the past few years, you've probably done pretty well. But as the old adage goes, past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nWith most everything returning to long-term norms following the effective wind-down of the COVID-19 pandemic, we should start to see all stocks -- even the FAANG shares -- better reflect their underlying companies' true worth.\n\nOne FAANG name that appears to have better prospects than the others right now is e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why.\n\nWhy Amazon is your best bet right now\n\nDon't panic if you already own one of the other FAANG stocks and don't have room in your portfolio for a new pick just yet. You'll be fine. All of them are long-term winners.\n\nBut the metrics look especially favorable for Amazon right now. Analysts are calling for top-line growth of a little more than 11% this year, with comparable-revenue growth in the cards every year through 2028. Profits are projected to grow from last year's expected figure of $2.68 per share all the way to $9.25 in the final year of that five-year stretch.\n\nHow is this older, already-enormous company still producing such growth? In a couple of different but complementary ways. One of these ways is its inaugural business: e-commerce. But there's a twist. Veteran investors will recall a time when Amazon was barely profitable -- if profitable at all. Its mission was growth at almost any cost.\n\nA funny thing's happened over the course of just the past few years, perhaps cemented into place by the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon's e-commerce operation has turned more profitable than it's ever been before. Even its long-beleaguered international e-commerce arm is finally inching its way to sustained operating profitability.\n\nIt's not exactly happening in the way you might expect, however. Over the course of the past three years, the company has turned up the heat on its advertising business, which allows third-party sellers to more prominently feature their products at Amazon.com. This venture produced a little over $31 billion in revenue in 2021 but has since reached an annualized pace of nearly $44 billion. Market research outfit Insider Intelligence believes this figure will reach on the order of $68 billion worth of revenue in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is high-margin revenue too, leveraging the Western world's most-frequently visited online-shopping site that Amazon spent the last 25 years perfecting. Indeed, it's conceivable that its advertising venture could be a bigger and better breadwinner than e-commerce alone might ever have become.\n\nAmazon's other key growth driver for the near and distant future is Amazon's cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It may not be Amazon's biggest business as measured by sales. In fact, AWS only accounts for about 16% of the company's total top line. Yet, cloud computing regularly makes up more than two-thirds of Amazon's operating income, and it's still just getting started.\n\nMordor Intelligence says the cloud-computing market is set to swell from roughly $700 billion this year to more than $1.4 trillion in 2029, similar to projections from Precedence Research as well as GlobalData. Data source: Amazon. Chart by author. Figures are in billions.\n\nAlready a market-share leader, AWS is positioned to capture at least its fair share of this growth. It may capture more than its fair share of this growth, in fact, now that it's custom-building cloud-computing platforms that specifically work with the market's preferred AI tech. For instance, AWS and Nvidia are now collaborating to offer supercomputing infrastructure built around Nvidia's powerful NVIDIA GH200 chips. This is the sort of powerful platform needed for next-generation generative artificial intelligence (AI) offerings.\n\nOther FAANG stocks are ok too, but...\n\nAgain, don't panic if you already own stakes in one or more of the other FAANG stocks and aren't ready to reorganize your holdings. There are certainly plenty of worse ways to be positioned as we move deeper into the first half of 2024.\n\nBut if I had to choose one, Amazon is the group's top prospect right now. And for what it's worth, the analyst community agrees. The vast majority of this crowd currently rates the stock as a strong buy, and the consensus target of $184 is a healthy 17% above the stock's present price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Amazon to be 'disruptive force' as it begins ad tier rollout — here's what's at stake",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) isexpected to start rolling out ads on its Prime Video streaming service beginning Monday in the US — and Wall Street is bullish on the tech behemoth massively disrupting the shifting media market.\n\nPrime Video subscribers will automatically be defaulted to the ad-supported tier at the current monthly price of $14.99 for Prime members and $8.99 for non-Prime members. For those who want to pay up for the premium, ad-free version, the price will go up by $3 a month, respectively.\n\n\"A 500 lb. gorilla enters the room,\" MoffettNathanson lead analyst Michael Morton wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"We strongly believe that Amazon’s decision to add advertising to Prime Video will be a disruptive force to commoditized advertising video on demand (AVOD) players, siloed connected TV (CTV) platforms and non-top 20 linear cable networks.\"\n\nAmazon has roughly 96 million US Prime households, but only a subset of that actively engages with Prime Video, according to MoffettNathanson. The firm estimates Prime Video, which streams shows like \"Reacher\" and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,\" has an active US subscriber base that's roughly equivalent to Netflix’s 70 million.\n\nAs a result of the new rollout, the firm anticipates video ad revenue of $1.3 billion in 2024and $2.3 billion in 2025. Subscription revenue should also go up by $500 million annually for those who opt to pay extra for the premium tier.\n\n\"We forecast Amazon and Disney (DIS) being neck-and-neck for largest drivers of AVOD ad-revenue,\" the analysts wrote, predicting the US connected TV and ad-supported market will hit $16 billion by 2025.\n\nAmazon is expected to lead the pack at $4 billion with Hulu close behind at $3 billion. Peacock (CMCSA) and Roku (ROKU) round out the top four at $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\n\nFollowing its US debut, the ad tier will roll out globally in the UK and Germany on Feb. 5 before dropping in France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia later this year. Amazon said it plans to have \"meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Adweek, ad buyers will pay a cost-per-thousand, or CPM rate, between $30 to $35. That's lower than what they pay to advertise on competitor platforms, which analysts say could lead to downward pressure on pricing.\n\nTo compare, Netflix (NFLX) and Disney were reportedly seeking a CPM rate between $50 and $60 for their respective ad tiers. Pushback from advertisers eventually convinced them to lower their asking price. Amazon will officially roll out ads on its Prime Video streaming service beginning Monday in the US. (Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nIn addition to pricing, Amazon's decision to default users to the ad-supported tier also differs from competitors, although it was considered by one streaming giant.\n\n\"We did consider making [ads] the default option,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said on Wednesday's earnings call. \"But given our long history of not having ads, we thought it was better for our members — rather than force them into a change and give them ads.\"\n\nPeters added he's not concerned when it comes to Amazon entering the ad-supported arena, telling investors there's plenty of ad inventory to go around.\n\n\"We talked about over $25 billion in [connected TV] ad spend alone, so there's room for multiple players,\" he said, noting the streamer will compete by \"playing to its strengths\" like viewership engagement.\n\nStill, the move is widely expected to massively transform the industry.\n\n\"Amazon has one of the broadest audience reaches of all the streaming services,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen told Yahoo Finance. \"They have the reach, they have the consumer data. There will likely be an acceleration toward retail media spending, which could encourage everybody else to do more shop-able advertising.\"\n\n\"It just raises the stakes,\" the analyst continued. \"Everybody now faces another competitor and a very large supply of inventory that they're going to be competing for. It'll drive more demand, or better tools to get better pricing on ads through better targeting or better use of programmatic advertising.\"\n\nNollen added Amazon's entrance will also encourage a substantial shift of ad buyers from linear to streaming — yet another blow to legacy media as the cable bundle continues to deteriorate.\n\n\"Among media companies, the entire media sector would appear to be at risk with the greatest pain at Paramount (PARA) and AMC Networks (AMCX) given their lack of diversified profitability away from linear networks and limited exposure to live cable network content,\" MoffettNathanson wrote in its report.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "You can earn fortune-building returns in the stock market if you can identify powerful, long-term trends -- and the businesses best positioned to profit from them.\n\nThe rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is one such trend. Here are two outstanding companies that are poised to capture a sizable share of the AI industry's profit in the coming years.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nArtificial intelligence will be built in the cloud. As the leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is well situated to profit from the AI boom.\n\nIn addition to providing the raw computing resources that power a growing number of AI applications, Amazon is striving to become a leader in generative AI. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers its customers access to powerful tools, such as its Titan foundation models, as well as AI models developed by Anthropic, Stability AI, and other promising machine learning upstarts. Better still, Amazon's highly efficient Trainium and Inferentia chips can help slash the costs of training models and running AI workloads on AWS.\n\nE-commerce remains another potent growth driver for Amazon. Global online retail sales will top $8.1 trillion by 2026, up from $6.3 trillion in 2023, according to Statista. Moreover, Amazon's cost-cutting efforts are helping to boost its operating margin as its sales rise. That's an excellent formula for rapid and sustained earnings growth.\n\nAdvertising is another notable opportunity. Third-party sellers pay hefty fees to market their products to the online retail titan's massive customer base. Amazon, in turn, is winning market share in a digital ad industry that's forecast to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, up from $531 billion in 2022, according to ResearchAndMarkets.\n\nWith these powerful trends fueling its growth, Amazon's share price could soar in the years ahead.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is also a prime beneficiary of the AI megatrend. The semiconductor giant's state-of-the-art chip designs lie at the heart of the computing systems that power many of the leading AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units can be used to train the large language models that underlie popular AI services such as ChatGPT. Demand for these cutting-edge chips is projected to soar to $400 billion by 2027, according to rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia commands more than 85% of this booming market, according to analysts at Raymond James.\n\nThe impact of this surging demand is transforming Nvidia's financial results. The tech titan's sales climbed 206% year over year to $18.1 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 29. Its adjusted operating profits, in turn, increased a stunning 652% to $11.6 billion.\n\nYet it's important to note that Nvidia is far more than just an AI growth story. Management sees a $100 billion market for the company's gaming-related chips and a $300 billion opportunity for its autonomous machine technology. All told, the company estimates its total addressable market at a whopping $1 trillion.\n\nNvidia clearly has plenty of room for further expansion, and Wall Street seems to agree. Analysts expect Nvidia's sales to grow by roughly 119% in 2024 and 57% in 2025 -- and its earnings to increase by over 100% annually over the next half-decade. Buy shares today, and you can position yourself to profit alongside this AI-powered tech titan.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Specifically, Model 15.0 increased model accuracy by about 15%, representing the largest improvement since tracking improvements began in 2018. The AI-driven credit models perform as expected, suggesting Upstart’s focus on innovation and continuous improvement.\n\nFurthermore, Upstart has successfully expanded its offerings beyond personal loans. The company’s auto retail platform saw significant growth, with a major original equipment manufacturer implementing Upstart’s software to support a new vehicle launch. Expanding car dealerships and partnerships with national non-prime auto lenders demonstrate Upstart’s focus on diversifying its business and tapping into new markets.\n\nMoreover, Upstart has made progress in the home equity market by launching the Upstart HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) product. The HELOC product is positioned as a prime product with expected annual loss rates of 1% or less, providing a counter-cyclical approach to Upstart’s refinance product. Upstart aims to bring a pricing advantage to the HELOC market and differentiate itself through speed, ease of access, and leveraging its existing platform for customer acquisition.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, despite challenges in the lending environment, Upstart has seen success with credit unions and views them as valuable partners. The company is doubling down on credit unions by enhancing features and connectivity and supporting loan participation, which improves liquidity. Thus, Upstart is actively pursuing committed funding partnerships to strengthen the reliability of loan funding, recognizing the importance of alternative sources.\n\nUiPath (PATH) The UiPath (PATH) app is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) continues to witness momentum in the financial services and healthcare sectors, where automation delivers significant value. There is a large non-profit health system in the U.S., one of the top 25 customers. The example of the health system, starting with core robotic process automation in 2018 and gradually adopting additional features like attendance automation, document understanding, test suites, and process mining, demonstrates UiPath’s ability to grow and evolve with its customers.\n\nAdditionally, UiPath’s lead in landing new logos is highlighted, with companies like Tenable and KIK Consumer Products adopting multiple platform products in their initial purchases. Also, NorthStar, UiPath’s value-based go-to-market tool, focuses on driving deeper customer conversations. Specifically, NorthStar’s impact on existing customers, as illustrated by the case of Sobeys expanding its automation footprint based on a NorthStar roadmap. Hence, this signifies the tool’s effectiveness in maximizing the return on investment for UiPath’s customers.\n\nFurthermore, UiPath’s strategic partnerships, such as the collaboration with SAP (NYSE:SAP) and the expanded partnership with Deloitte, are crucial for expanding its reach and driving increased engagement with Global Systems Integrators (GSIs). The embedding of UiPath’s AI-powered business automation platform into Deloitte’s Ascend service delivery platform indicates the depth of collaboration.\n\nFinally, UiPath’s focus on broadening its technology ecosystem is evident in recent partnerships with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Bedrock. Also, the AI-Powered Business Automation Platform is available on the Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud Marketplace. These partnerships facilitate seamless integration and accessibility for automation developers. Therefore, integrating widely used platforms enhances UiPath’s market presence and value growth potential.\n\nJabil (JBL) Male and Female Industrial Engineers in Hard Hats Discuss New Project while Using Laptop. They Make Showing Gestures.They Work in a Heavy Industry Manufacturing Factory. manufacturing stocks\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff via Shutterstock\n\nJabil’s (NYSE:JBL) revenue and operating income are its fundamentals, supporting its value potential. For instance, Jabil’s Q1 fiscal 2024 has an approximately $8.4 billion revenue, near the low end of the guidance range provided in September. The revenue trend is a crucial numerical indicator of Jabil’s financial health. Despite being slightly below expectations, the scale of revenue, $8.4 billion, demonstrates the company’s substantial market presence.\n\nFurthermore, the core operating income for the quarter is revealed to be $499 million, representing 6% of revenue. This is up 1.2% year-over-year, signaling improved operating efficiency and profitability. The improvement reflects a better business mix, normal seasonal mobility patterns, and accounting impacts of assets held for sale. Excluding the impact of assets held for sale, the company reported the core operating margin as roughly 5.3%. Hence, this indicates a still robust margin even when accounting for certain exceptional items.\n\nIn the middle of the top and bottom lines, the net interest expense was $70 million, which is $3 million better than expected. This improvement is based on lower quarterly inventory levels due to lower revenue and better-working capital management.\n\nFinally, from a profitability perspective, the diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.47. Core diluted EPS for the quarter was reported at $2.60, a significant 13% improvement over Q1 fiscal 2024. Therefore, this improvement in core EPS is considered a positive indicator of the company’s profitability and value generation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "These Are the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2024, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "The big winners of the past aren't always the big winners of the future. However, that doesn't mean that it won't be the case.\n\nIn 2023, the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks ruled the stock market. Each of the seven stocks skyrocketed by 48% or more (for some, much more). But how does Wall Street think they'll perform going forward?\n\nNot-so-magnificent forecasts\n\nWall Street has some not-so-magnificent forecasts for most of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) delivered the second-biggest gain of the group last year, with its share price nearly tripling in value. The stock is off to a good start in 2024 as well, rising more than 10%. The average 12-month price target for Meta is even lower than its current share price now, though.\n\nAnalysts don't have great expectations for Alphabet, either. The Google parent's shares vaulted 58% higher in 2023. The consensus price target for the stock today reflects a meager upside potential of around 2%.\n\nApple doesn't fare much better on Wall Street. Although the tech giant's shares jumped 48% last year, analysts' average price target for the stock is only 3% above the current share price.\n\nMicrosoft is running neck-and-neck with Apple as the biggest company based on market cap after a 57% gain in 2023. Analysts aren't looking for the momentum to continue, however. The consensus price target reflects an upside potential of around 4%.\n\nNo large-cap stock generated as much excitement last year as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The generative AI boom drove the chipmaker's share price up a whopping 239%. Nvidia has extended those gains so far in 2024, rising close to 25%. The party won't keep going, according to Wall Street. The average price target for Nvidia is less than 5% above its current share price.\n\nWall Street's favorites\n\nIf you've kept count, we've ruled out five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That leaves only Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla boasts the greatest upside potential based on the latest data available even after its shares more than doubled last year. The average 12-month price target for the stock is nearly 24% above the electric vehicle maker's current share price.\n\nHowever, there's a big gotcha. Tesla's shares sank last week after the company announced disappointing fourth-quarter results. Its warning of a major slowdown in sales growth in 2024 was especially worrisome. Don't be surprised if some analysts soon lower their price targets for the stock.\n\nAmazon stock vaulted 81% higher in 2023. Many on Wall Street think that it will keep the momentum going this year. The consensus price target for Amazon reflects an upside potential of nearly 16%.\n\nThere's also more of a consensus about Amazon than there is for Tesla. Of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in January who cover the stock, 43 rated it as a buy or strong buy. Only eight of the 23 analysts who cover Tesla recommended it as a buy or a strong buy. Seven analysts rated the stock as an \"underperform\" or recommended selling it.\n\nAre the analysts right?\n\nI wouldn't bet the farm that any of Wall Street's price targets will prove to be accurate. There's no way to know for sure how a given stock will perform over a 12-month period.\n\nIf I had to guess which of these stocks will beat analysts' expectations the most, I'd go with Meta. Its valuation looks relatively attractive. I won't be surprised if the company's earnings continue to grow if the economy doesn't falter.\n\nWhich \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is Wall Street most likely to be right about? Probably Amazon, in my opinion. The company's profitability and free cash flow are improving significantly. Amazon also has a big opportunity as IT spending transitions to the cloud, as do Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "The Single Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy in 2024, According to Some Wall Street Analysts -- No, It's Not Nvidia",
        "content": "Several Wall Street analysts have selected Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as a top pick in 2024, including Thomas Champion at Piper Sandler, Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan Chase, and Scott Devitt at Wedbush Securities. The reason for that optimism can be summarized in three points: improving profitability in retail, strong momentum in digital advertising, and a potential reacceleration in cloud services revenue driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nArgus Research analyst Jim Kelleher highlighted that last point in a recent note to clients, speaking on the potential of Amazon Web Services (AWS): \"As the leading provider of infrastructure-as-a-service and other cloud services, AWS is uniquely positioned in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market, and the Anthropic partnership meaningfully strengthens AWS at a key time in the AI gold rush.\"\n\nThat may surprise some investors given that Nvidia is viewed as the best AI stock in certain Wall Street circles. But the point is somewhat irrelevant because attempting to pick a single winner is a poor strategy. It would be more prudent to build a basket of AI stocks, and Amazon definitely deserves a place in such a basket. Here's why.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three growing markets\n\nAmazon reported encouraging financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 13% to $143.1 billion on strong growth in advertising services. The cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to drag on the top line, but deal trends point to a reacceleration in the coming quarters. On the bottom line, net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) more than tripled to reach $9.9 billion due to cost reduction efforts like regionalization of its U.S. fulfillment network.\n\nThe graphic below details third-quarter revenue across all seven business segments. Chart by Author. Shown above is Amazon's third quarter revenue across all seven business segments.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three markets that should support double-digit sales growth for many years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nE-commerce: Amazon operates the most visited online marketplace in the world, and it has steadily gained share across North America and Western Europe over the last four years. In 2023, Amazon accounted for 38.7% of retail e-commerce sales in those geographies, up from 36.4% in 2019. That scale creates a powerful network effect that naturally brings more buyers and sellers to the marketplace. It also lets Amazon reinvest more heavily in its business than its peers. As an example, the company has constructed a logistics network that rivals UPS. That infrastructure supports fulfillment services for merchants and rapid delivery for buyers, making its marketplace more compelling for all parties. Digital advertising: Amazon has evolved its retail footprint into a booming advertising business. The company has a unique ability to engage shoppers and source data from its marketplace, and that makes it an ideal partner for media buyers looking to reach consumers with relevant advertising. Amazon accounts for 75% of retail media spending in the U.S. -- 10 times more market share than second-place Walmart -- and it recently became the third-largest advertising company in the world. Moreover, Amazon should continue gaining share given that retail media is the fastest-growing channel in the broader digital advertising market. Cloud computing: Amazon Web Services is the market leader in numerous cloud verticals, including compute, networking, storage, database, and machine learning services. In total, AWS accounted for 32% of cloud infrastructure and platforms services (CIPS) spending in the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure ranked second with 23% market share and Alphabet's Google Cloud ranked third with 11% market share. Rapid innovation is a big reason why the company has been so successful. Research company Gartner says AWS has the greatest breadth and depth of CIPS capabilities.\n\nTurning to the future, Straits Research expects online retail sales to increase at 8% annually through 2030, and Grand View Research believes the cloud computing and adtech markets will compound at 14% annually during the same period. That gives Amazon a good shot at 10% annual sales growth through the end of the decade, though its AI product roadmap leaves room for upside.\n\nAmazon is uniquely positioned to monetize AI cloud services\n\nSpending across AI hardware, software, and services is projected to grow at about 40% annually over the next decade. Amazon is ideally positioned to benefit from that tailwind. AWS is not only the leader in the broader CIPS market, but also the leader in the cloud AI developer services market. Moreover, the company has a robust development pipeline that is creating new revenue streams at all three layers of the AI stack.\n\nAI infrastructure: AWS is designing custom silicon for AI training (Trainium) and inference (Inferentia). According to CEO Andy Jassy, those chips have \"better price performance characteristics\" than other options. Amazon also announced a partnership with Anthropic, an AI start-up for which AWS will serve as the primary cloud provider. Anthropic will use Trainium and Inferentia chips to build future foundational models, and it will collaborate with AWS on future chip design. AI model services: AWS recently launched Amazon Bedrock, a cloud service featuring pretrained foundational models from Amazon and third-party providers like Anthropic. Bedrock allows businesses to customize pretrained models with their own data to build and deploy generative AI applications. AI software: CodeWhisperer is a generative AI coding companion that automates certain aspects of software development. That product launched in April 2023. The company more recently announced a generative AI business assistant called Amazon Q. That product can summarize text, draft emails, and surface relevant information across various data sources and systems, including third-party products from Microsoft and Google.\n\nHere's the upshot: Amazon is well positioned to monetize AI given its leadership in cloud computing and ongoing product development efforts. That should help AWS maintain or even increase its market share, which lends credit to the idea that Amazon can grow sales at 10% annually (or faster) through the end of the decade.\n\nWith that in mind, the current valuation of 2.9 times sales looks quite reasonable, and it's a slight discount to the three-year average of 3 times sales. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in Amazon today as part of a bigger basket of AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "These 3 Warren Buffett Stocks Have Skyrocketed Over 50% -- and They're Still No-Brainer Buys",
        "content": "Many investors still follow the adage to \"buy low and sell high.\" It's not a bad strategy. However, there's another one that can work with the right stocks: Buy high and hold.\n\nSome stocks remain great picks even after they've delivered huge gains. We only have to look at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio to find several examples. These Buffett stocks have soared over 50% -- and they're still no-brainer buys.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has skyrocketed close to 90% since the beginning of 2023. While several factors were behind the big gain, the surging interest in generative AI played a big part in Amazon's outsize returns.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway trimmed its position in Amazon a little during the third quarter of 2023. However, the conglomerate's stake still totals nearly $1.6 billion.\n\nMy take is that Buffett and Berkshire would have been better off buying more Amazon shares. Why? For one thing, the company's profits continue to grow by leaps and bounds, thanks to a renewed focus on the bottom line.\n\nMore importantly, Amazon's long-term prospects remain exceptionally strong. Organizations shifting their IT spending to the cloud (with the desire to build AI apps serving as key motivation) should provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services. There's still plenty of room for Amazon's e-commerce business to grow. The company also continues to expand into new markets.\n\n2. D.R. Horton\n\nBuffett didn't buy many stocks in 2023. D.R. Horton(NYSE: DHI) stands out as a notable exception. It was one of three homebuilder stocks added to Berkshire's portfolio in the second quarter last year.\n\nD.R. Horton has been a big winner, jumping nearly 60% since the beginning of 2023. However, the stock has pulled back recently due to the company's disappointing fiscal 2024 first-quarter update.\n\nI'm not concerned, though. The U.S. has experienced a housing shortage for several years that hasn't been addressed. D.R. Horton ranks as the largest homebuilder in the country based on volume, a spot it's held for more than two decades. The company's long-term prospects should be strong, thanks to the underlying market dynamics.\n\nStory continues\n\nD.R. Horton could perform better than expected over the near term, too. The company's full-year guidance for fiscal 2024 projects only modest revenue growth. However, the Federal Reserve has signaled that interest rate cuts could be on the way this year. If so, mortgage rates could also fall and provide an incentive for more Americans to buy new homes.\n\n3. Lennar\n\nLennar(NYSE: LEN) was one of the other homebuilder stocks Buffett bought last year. Like D.R. Horton, Lennar has turned out to be a good investment for the legendary investor. Since early 2023, the stock is up close to 65%.\n\nThe same factors that bode well for D.R. Horton should also help Lennar. The company expects to close on 80,000 new homes in its current fiscal year. Executive chairman and co-CEO Stuart Miller said in the company's fiscal 2023 Q4 update in December that Lennar's \"strategy has positioned us particularly well as interest rates now seem likely to moderate in 2024.\"\n\nEven with its big gains over the last year or so, Lennar's valuation looks attractive. The stock's forward earnings multiple is under 10.5x.\n\nLennar also has a little something to offer for investors who like income. Its dividend currently yields 1.35%. With a payout ratio of less than 11%, it's a pretty good bet that the company will increase its dividend in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lennar right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lennar, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lennar wasn't one of them.

        "content": "AI still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs — the human touch. (Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nArtificial intelligence is now a part of our everyday lives and many of us use and encounter AI without even thinking about it. We ask Alexa to play music or check a recipe, Siri organises our calendars and Facebook, Instagram and X use the technology to decide which social media posts — or adverts — to show us.\n\nThe development of accessible tools like ChatGPT has also led to the integration of AI in the workplace. AI’s ability to analyse huge amounts of data and recognise patterns allows it to imitate human function and to problem-solve, reason, learn, perceive and carry out day-to-day admin tasks. Understandably, this had led to concerns about its potential to surpass human capacity in certain areas.\n\nAI may be capable of creating images and text, hiring, predicting trends and making financial decisions, but it’s important to remember its limitations. While the tech will undoubtedly bring a whole host of support and capabilities to our workplaces, it is essential to understand that it won’t completely replace humans — at least not yet, anyway.\n\nRead more: How AI could help us move to a four-day work week\n\nIt still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs — the human touch.\n\nAI can't empathise\n\n“AI has been a great tool to assist with data analysis and automation, but it lacks the genuine empathy and practical common sense in various aspects of work and life,” says careers expert Deirdre Orr. “The ability to understand emotions, navigate complex social dynamics, and make nuanced decisions based on context and experience sets humans apart in ways that AI cannot fully emulate.”\n\nEmpathy, the ability to see another person’s perspective and appreciate their point of view, is a powerful tool. Research suggests that the genuine feeling and expression of empathy has far-reaching effects in our personal and professional lives, and has been linked to better physical health, the maintenance of cognitive function, happiness, resilience, resistance to burnout and better relationships.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has also been associated with professional success, putting pay to the idea of ‘looking after number one’. In a 14-year study from the University of California-Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, those who were generous and agreeable were more likely to be promoted to a position of power.\n\nEmpathy can also increase sales and investment opportunities too, as being empathic can help people better understand the motivation of clients, customers and investors.\n\nRead more: Should you use AI to write your cover letter?\n\n“Empathy and common sense are invaluable assets in the workplace, each offer very unique qualities that AI cannot replicate,” says Orr. “They enhance collaboration, reduce conflicts, and boost employee engagement. Furthermore, these qualities stimulate innovation, improve customer relations, and aid in sound decision-making.”\n\nEssentially, empathy softens negative emotions — something that AI can’t do. Of course, this is less important if all jobs were to become automated overnight, but research suggests this is unlikely to happen any time soon. In healthcare the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial. (PhonlamaiPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nAI in the workplace\n\nWhile the new technology is likely to disrupt our workplaces, it will do so by taking on our admin-heavy tasks instead of replacing us completely. In part, a recent MIT study found, this is because AI is too expensive.\n\nThere are jobs in which empathy is even more important. Artificial Intelligence has been making significant strides in healthcare, from diagnosis to treatment and research. It has been rightly hailed as a game-changer, but its lack of an ability to empathise is its achilles heel. In healthcare — and particularly mental healthcare — the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial.\n\nFor people in distress, human connection and meaningful relationships are key components of recovery — so much so that compassion is an irreplaceable part of a therapeutic relationship. Having an empathic connection with a doctor, nurse or therapist builds trust, which can encourage compliance with treatments and help patients cope with difficult diagnoses. This is something AI simply can’t replicate and even if we were to create tech that mimics empathy and compassion, it would raise serious ethical problems.\n\nRead more: Will AI make us even lonelier at work?\n\nAnd, Orr adds, there are other problems with relying too heavily on AI. “It is limited in the workplace when it comes to actual ethical decision making,” she explains. “Moral judgement comes from within a human, so when it's time to fully assess a situation and issue a complex decision it would be very difficult for AI to provide a response that is fair, ethical, and unbiased.”\n\nA good example is discrimination in recruitment. AI can scan job applications and vet applicants quickly and effectively, making what is notoriously a time-consuming process much more streamlined. But, the decisions made by AI are shaped by the initial data it receives. So if the underlying data is unfair, skewed or discriminatory, the resulting algorithms can perpetuate bias, potentially contributing to widespread inequality.\n\n“AI just can't replicate or navigate the complex nuances of various human aspects in the workplace,” says Orr. “Also, AI is very limited when it comes to customer service. It can understand most simple commands and requests, but AI bots truly struggle to offer employees, customers and clients the personalised touch that is needed to provide exemplary customer service.”\n\nWatch: Accenture CTO explains how AI will aid businesses, new jobs</p>\\n<p>Accenture (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACN?p=ACN\\\">ACN</a>) Chief Technology Officer Paul Daugherty joins Yahoo Finance for the latest installment of its <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/live/ai-revolution\\\"><em>AI Revolution special</em></a> to help discuss the data and the ways workplace AI may effectively be incorporated into many business models to benefit workers.</p>\\n<p>Daugherty explains that the advent of AI is like nothing before, and so businesses will need to revolutionize how they approach work: \\\"We believe what's happening, what needs to happen, is companies need to re-invent work itself and how it happens. That then changes the role that people have. So think about how to develop those new skills — think back to the internet when it came out. Before the internet, we didn't have web designers, eCommerce experts, search engine optimizers. We didn't have eBay, Etsy, entrepreneurs building businesses around the internet. That's the new creation we're going to see.

        "title": "Earnings, Fed this week; Evergrande ordered to liquidate - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were subdued on Monday, with markets preparing for a busy week of major earnings and central bank policy announcements. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among many of the tech giants due to report results this week, while the Federal Reserve will unveil its latest policy decision and deliver closely-watched commentary that could help determine the path ahead for interest rates. China Evergrande (HK:3333) is ordered to liquidate, starting a new and possibly lengthy chapter for the heavily indebted property developer.\n\n1. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around both sides of the flatline on Monday, as traders geared up for a week of key corporate earnings and central bank decisions.\n\nBy 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 55 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 19 points or 0.1%.\n\nA solid start to the new year for the main averages on Wall Street will likely face a stern exam in the coming days. Investors will be parsing through numbers from some of America's largest businesses and digesting influential commentary from the Federal Reserve, both of which may help clarify the outlook for the broader economy (see below).\n\nThe S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% on Friday, leaving the benchmark index near all-time highs, a move that reflects market hopes that inflation may be cooling without a meltdown in growth -- a scenario commonly referred to as a \"soft landing.\" The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also fell by 0.4% to end the prior trading week, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%.\n\n2. Big-name earnings ahead\n\nA parade of high-profile and possibly market-moving results are due out from a string of companies this week, including many of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have powered a recent surge in equities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft will report after the bell, only days after the tech giant's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which like Microsoft has been a beneficiary of a wave of hype around artificial intelligence, will also unveil its latest numbers following the close of markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday will feature semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), with investors on the lookout for the San Diego-based group's view of the year ahead for chipmaking. Quarterly figures are also due from Boeing (NYSE:BA), the embattled planemaker who has come under fresh scrutiny following a dangerous mid-flight blowout on one of its 737 Max 9 models earlier this month, as well as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), the Danish drugmaker behind the popular weight loss medication Wegovy.\n\nMore megacap tech firms are set to step into the limelight on Thursday, including iPhone-maker Apple, e-commerce behemoth Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\n3. Fed decision in focus\n\nMarkets will also be keeping their eye on the Federal Reserve, as the world's most influential central bank holds its latest two-day policy meeting.\n\nFed officials are tipped to keep interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs following the gathering on Wednesday, placing extra focus on any comments regarding the outlook for borrowing costs in the near term.\n\nIn December, the Fed signaled that it could reduce rates six times this year, fueling hopes for a cut as early as March. But several policymakers have moved to temper these expectations, indicating that worries remain that a rapid loosening in financial conditions could reignite cooling inflationary pressures.\n\nA stronger-than-expected advance estimate of fourth-quarter U.S. growth last week also bolstered the case for the Fed to hold off on lowering rates any time soon. Meanwhile, economists expect January nonfarm payrolls on Friday to show ongoing resilience in the U.S. labor market -- although the Fed will not be able to factor this particular piece of data into its latest projections.\n\nHow the Fed sees price gains and economic activity evolving in 2024 will likely influence bets over the timing of the first cut. According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, there is an almost 50% chance the bank will roll it out in May.\n\n4. China Evergrande ordered to liquidate\n\nChina Evergrande has been ordered to be wound up by a Hong Kong court after the world's most indebted property developer failed to secure a restructuring agreement with its creditors.\n\nThe group, which has over $300 billion in total liabilities, has been attempting to secure the deal for more than two years in the wake of a bond repayment and a series of court hearings.\n\nBut Justice Linda Chan on Monday appointed management consultancy Alvarez&Marsal to liquidate Evergrande, arguing that the move will provide some certainty to creditors. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" Chan said in the morning court session, Reuters reported.\n\nEvergrande's Chief Executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media that the decision will not impact the operations of its onshore and offshore units. But analysts have flagged that the liquidation process could be complicated and lengthy, as well as damaging to already downbeat sentiment around the state of China's property market.\n\nShares in Evergrande slumped by just under 21% after the announcement.\n\n5. Crude volatile amid Middle East turmoil\n\nOil prices were choppy on Monday, as traders fretted over increased disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nBy 05:08 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.4% lower at $77.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $82.68 per barrel. Both contracts had risen earlier in the day.\n\nThe attack, which U.S. President Joe Biden said was carried out by Iran-backed militants, resulted in the death of three American service members. It was the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.\n\nIran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns over a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings, Fed this week; Evergrande ordered to liquidate - what's moving markets\n\nSlovakia looks to buy Patriot air defence system from United States\n\nChina's vice premier urges more support for listed firms amid market rout",

        "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a muted fashion Monday, at the start of an action-packed week full of event risk, including the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year.\n\nAt 03:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% lower, while the CAC 40 in France traded 0.1% higher and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. rose 0.1%.\n\nFed to meet on Wednesday\n\nInvestors have started the new week on a cautious note, with the main indices trading in tight ranges ahead of a potentially crucial policy-setting by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.\n\nThe U.S. is set to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.\n\nThe Bank of England also meets this week, and is also expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday, following on from the European Central Bank keeping interest rates unchanged at a record-high 4% last week.\n\nRyanair trims annual profit forecast\n\nIn the corporate sector, Ryanair (IR:RYA) stock fell 2.9% after the budget airline trimmed its profit forecast for the year to the end of March after some online travel agents stopped selling its flights in December, forcing it to cut fares to fill seats.\n\nPhilips (AS:PHG) stock fell 4.4% after the Dutch medical device maker reported another loss in 2023, even though the losses were trimmed compared with the previous year, as it seeks to bounce back from a series of damaging recalls.\n\nBayer (ETR:BAYGN) stock fell over 5% after the German pharmaceutical giant was ordered by a U.S. court to pay $2.25 billion in damages, the highest amount yet in its ongoing litigation linked to an alleged carcinogenic effect of its Roundup weedkiller.\n\nHolcim (SIX:HOLN) stock rose 5% after the Swiss building materials giant unveiled plans to separate and list its North American business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe European banking sector is likely to be in focus later this week as a number of the region’s major lenders release quarterly earnings.\n\nAdditionally, in the U.S., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.\n\nCrude gains on Middle East turmoil\n\nOil prices rose Monday on increased worries of disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nBy 03:25 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $78.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $83.21 a barrel.\n\nBoth contracts rose last week for a second week in a row and settled at their highest in nearly two months on Friday.\n\nThis attack was by Iran-backed militants, according to the U.S. President Joe Biden, and resulted in the death of three U.S. service members, the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.\n\nIran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns of a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nAdditionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $2,050.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0840.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 30 highest paying part-time jobs for 18 year olds. We have also discussed the latest developments around employment in US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest Paying Part-Time Jobs for 18 Year Olds.\n\nThe Biden administration's recent change to the Fair Labor Standards Act, set to take effect on March 11, has sparked concerns over its impact on the freelance economy. Approximately 60% of today's teenagers express a desire to start their own businesses, contributing to the entrepreneurial environment for the economy. However, the new rule aims to restrict freelancers, potentially jeopardizing 58% of all app-based jobs, as highlighted by a Massachusetts study.\n\nIn 2021, Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) reported that 59 million Americans, making up 36% of the workforce, identify as freelancers, contributing around $1.27 trillion to the US economy annually. The administration's decision has prompted a court challenge and draws parallels to California's unsuccessful attempt, which resulted in job losses and business closures. Advocates argue for the implementation of Benefit Savings Accounts to support freelancers, allowing companies to extend benefits and preserving the flexibility valued by the majority of freelancers.\n\nSpeaking of the popularity and rise of freelancing, Collective, the all-in-one online back-office platform, has released findings from its Unconventional Jobs Survey. They found major generational differences in career perspectives. The survey revealed that 59% of Gen Z and young Millennials (18-34 years old) have a backup plan for employment in case of layoffs, compared to only 30% of those aged 35 and above.\n\nSpeaking of layoffs, eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) has announced plans to cut approximately 1,000 jobs, representing about 9% of its current workforce. As the e-commerce giant addresses challenges related to the growth of its business, the CEO stated that the overall headcount and expenses have outpaced business growth and these organizational changes aim to align and consolidate certain teams to enhance the end-to-end customer experience globally. Additionally, eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) will scale back contracts within its alternative workforce in the coming months. This decision follows a trend of US tech layoffs post-pandemic, as other industry giants, such as Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), have also undergone workforce adjustments. Last February, eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) had previously announced plans to lay off 500 employees globally, constituting 4% of its total workforce.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the financial end, eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) reported excellent financial results for Q3 2023, with a 5% YoY increase in revenue to $2.5 billion and a 2% YoY growth in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) to $18.0 billion. The company's initiatives like the successful expansion of the eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)’s Guaranteed Fit program, introduction of new consignment services, and innovations like generative AI (GenAI) features, have contributed to these positive outcomes. Notably, eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) first-party advertising products, driven by Promoted Listings, generated $345 million in Q3, reflecting a 39% YoY increase.\n\nThe survey also highlighted that 64% of the younger demographic either freelances or plans to do so, while only 31% of the older group anticipates freelancing. Notably, 38% of under-35s consider a successful career as having enough money to support their lifestyle without working 40+ hours weekly. The data also shows that 38% of younger individuals already participate in freelance work, compared to 16% of the older cohort.\n\nMoreover, as the freelance economy matures, the complexity and scale of projects facilitated through freelance platforms have also expanded. High-skilled freelancers, specializing in areas like software development, data science, consulting, and web design, are in high demand, contributing to the growth of the market. This also explains why data science is one of the most in-demands jobs for the future.\n\nFiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR) and Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) are considered key players in the freelancing industry.\n\nFiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR), with over 4.3 million active buyers across 160+ countries, has a global reach that provides freelancers access to a huge clientele. The simplicity of the platform makes it highly user-friendly and hence, allows freelancers to set up profiles easily and also secure gigs quickly, often within a week. However, Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR) charges a flat 20% commission on all projects, which can be beneficial for shorter-term tasks but might incentivize exploring other platforms for long-term projects. It primarily attracts smaller business owners and individuals looking for specific, one-off projects, with an average client budget of approximately $262. 30 Highest Paying Part-Time Jobs for 18 Year Olds\n\nPhoto by Annie Spratt on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the highest paying part-time jobs for 18 year olds, we looked at jobs with three features.

Jeff Bezos sits at an original Amazon door desk in a post from Lauren Sanchez on Instagram.\n\n\"After all these years… When I walked in on him working this morning, I took this picture,\" Sanchez wrote.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the top 19 industries that are hiring right now. We have also discussed the state of US labor market. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 Industries That are Hiring Right Now.\n\nState of the US Job Market in 2024\n\nIn 2024, the US labor market is expected to show signs of stabilization after a tumultuous 2023. The unemployment rate, which reached 3.7% in November of 2023 is on a positive trajectory, and the Fed is considering interest-rate cuts. Despite concerns of a recession, the economy is defying expectations with a soft landing. Wages are anticipated to slow down, returning to pre-pandemic levels. While wages posted on Indeed were up 4.2% in October, it marks a decline from July's peak of 4.8% and January 2022's 9.3%. Merit increases are also expected to slow, with employers predicting a 3.5% rise in 2024, slightly below 2023 levels.\n\nHiring, while slowing, still holds promise, with 57% of managers expressing plans to increase permanent roles in the first half of 2024. The job market is forecasted to slow down further, making the present a relatively favorable time for job transitions. Layoffs, though unpredictable, are expected to remain low in 2024, standing at 41% lower than November 2022. However, there is a cautious note that a sudden increase to a more recessionary level could occur if the US slips into a downturn. Despite challenges, there is a prevailing optimism among employers towards 2024, with a focus on rightsizing and steady growth.\n\nWhich Companies are Hiring Immediately ?\n\nAccording to a recent analysis by career site Indeed, some companies in the US are hiring at a faster pace than others. Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) topped the list with a relative hire rate of 2.29, making it the fastest in terms of hiring among the companies analyzed. Mariano's followed closely with a rate of 2.06, securing the second position. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ranked at No. 8 with a relative hire rate of 1.68. The analysis focused on the period from August 1 to the end of October, and the companies on the list are still actively hiring.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s hiring will not be limited to the US alone. In fact, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly expanding its operations in Sweden by posting seven job openings for metal workers, painters, and claims adjusters at its Stockholm factory, despite ongoing sympathy strikes in the region. The conflict began when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) mechanics in Sweden signed with the labor union IF Metall, but negotiations broke down as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) refused to sign a collective agreement. Affiliated unions launched sympathy strikes affecting different aspects of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) business. The decision to hire nonunion workers suggests Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) commitment to its anti-union stance, potentially impacting US workers, who are the primary target of United Auto Workers leadership.\n\nSpeaking of Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG), their recent acquisition of SJR National Retail for $6 million may seem like a minor move, but it holds major implications for the jewelry retail industry. Despite a decline of 8.1% in Q2 revenues and a 12% drop in same-store sales, Signet's stock rose from $71 to almost $80 after surpassing analysts' estimates. The company maintained its year-end guidance with sales projected at $7.1 to $7.3 billion and an operating income between $635 million to $675 million.\n\nNotably, Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)’s acquisition of SJR National Retail, a full-service jewelry and watch repair company, opened doors for business-to-business repair services to independent jewelers. With a potential $1.2 billion opportunity, Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)  aims to support the entire jewelry industry, including its brands like Kay, Zales, and Blue Nile.

        "title": "A Fed meeting, big tech earnings and the January jobs report: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks closed out another week hovering near record highs as one of the busiest weeks of the quarter is set to greet investors.\n\nEarnings from five of the\"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) — will highlight a packed week of quarterly reports. In all, 106 S&P 500 companies including six Dow components are slated to report in the week ahead, per FactSet.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Fed is set to announce its latest policy decision. Investors expect the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Investors will be closely watching for any commentary during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's conference on Wednesday about when the Federal Reserve may begin cutting rates.\n\nOn Friday, the January jobs report is set for release where economists expect a modest tick down in job additions while the unemployment rate is projected to remain flat at 3.7%.\n\nElsewhere on the schedule, key updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy, as well as the latest data on job openings, highlight the economic side of things.\n\nOutside of big tech, results from AMD (AMD), Starbucks (SBUX), Pfizer (PFE), CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Boeing (BA) headline the reporting calendar.\n\nStocks will enter the final week of the month near all-time highs. After a rocky start to the year, both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are up over 2% so far in January. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up more than 1%.\n\nThe market narrative has shifted significantly since the last time Jerome Powell took the podium in December. Investors aggressively priced in a March cut and then scaled back those bets as economic growth has continued to surprise to the upside.\n\nBut with inflation down to its lowest levels in nearly three years, many Wall Street economists still believe that the Fed will begin cutting in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It is time for Fed officials to take the win and start dialing back the level of policy restrictiveness soon,\" Capital Economics deputy chief US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nInvestor bets are still mixed on when that cut will come. As of Friday afternoon, markets had priced in a 47% chance the Fed cuts rates in March, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Looking out to May, investors believe there is a 88% chance rates are lower by the end of that meeting.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen expects the Fed to change its post-meeting statement to more neutral language about the restrictiveness of policy, serving as \"a de-facto easing bias.\" But he doesn't believe Powell and the central bank will fully tip their hand just yet.\n\n\"Labor markets have cooled, and inflation has come down more rapidly than expected absent a large rise in unemployment, but we don't think the Fed is ready to send a strong signal about its intentions just yet,\" Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell arrives to speak at a press conference following a closed two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve in Washington, U.S., December 13, 2023. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGapen believes the Fed will be buying time to see more data. And some of that data will come in the days following the Fed meeting.\n\nThe January jobs report is scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. And while layoffs have dominated headlines in recent weeks, economists expect any signs of a broad labor market slowdown to remain absent from the data.\n\nThe report is expected to show 175, 000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month with unemploymentticking up slightly to 3.8%, according to data from Bloomberg. In December, the US economy added 216,000 jobs while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%.\n\n\"All told, the themes of improving supply, cooling demand and overall labor market normalization likely continued in January,\" Wells Fargo's team of economists led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. \"Although payroll growth has held up remarkably well recently, there are several signs of further moderation in the months ahead. On net, fewer industries are adding headcounts each month and job openings and hiring plans continue to pull back.\"\n\nAs if the economic calendar alone wouldn't be enough to keep investors on their toes, the biggest corporate earnings week of the quarter will also set the stage for how companies are holding up amid the higher interest rate environment.\n\nAnalysis from FactSet on Friday shows just how much upcoming earnings could drive the market narrative. Excluding Tesla, the other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks are expected to be the top six earnings drivers for the S&P 500, contributing year-over-year earnings growth of 53.7%. Excluding those six companies the remaining 494 companies would report a 10.5% earnings decline.\n\nFive of those key companies — Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Apple — are set to report in the week ahead.\n\nEvercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, January (-9.3 prior)\n\nEarnings: Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) Phillips (PHG), SoFi Technologies (SOFI), Whirlpool (WHR)\n\nTuesday:\n\nEconomic data: S&P CoreLogic 20-city year-over-year NSA (4.87% prior);Conference Board consumer confidence, January (112.5 expected, 110.7 prior)JOLTS job openings, December (8.79 million prior); Dallas Fed services activity, January (-8.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Alphabet (GOOGL), Electronic Arts (EA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Juniper Networks (JNP), Match Group (MTCH), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), Microsoft (MSFT), Pfizer (PFE), Starbucks (SBUX), UPS (UPS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended January 26 (3.7%); ADP private payrolls, January (+150,000 expected, +164,000 prior); Employment cost index, fourth quarter (1.0% expected, 1.1% prior) Federal Reserve monetary policy decision (no interest rate change expected)\n\nEarnings: Aflac (AFL), Boeing (BA), Hess (HES), Mastercard (MA), MetLife (MET), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Phillips 66 (PSX), Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, January, (-20.2% prior); Unit labor costs, fourth quarter (+2.6% expected, -1.2% prior); Nonfarm productivity, fourth quarter (+1.6% expected, +5.2% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ending January 27 (214,000 prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, January final (50.3 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, December (+0.5% expected, 0.4% prior); ISM manufacturing, January (47.5 expected, 47.2 prior); ISM prices paid, January (45.2 prior)\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Deckers Brand (DECK), Honeywell (HON), Meta (META), Merck (MRK), Royal Caribbean Group (RCL), Peloton (PTON), SiriusXM (SIRI), Skechers (SKX), Tractor Supply (TSCO), The Clorox Company (CLX), United States Steel (X)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, January (+175,000 expected, +216,000 prior); Unemployment rate, January (3.8% expected, 3.7% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, January (+4.1% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, January (34.4 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, January (62.5% previously); U. of Mich sentiment, January final (78.8 expected, 78.8 prior); Factory orders, December (+0.5% expected, 2.6% prior); Durable goods orders, December final (0.0% prior)\n\nEarnings: Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Charter Communications (CHTR)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks Set to Join Apple and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club by 2030",
        "content": "There's been a technological shift in the major market indexes over the past two decades. For example, in 2004, General Electric and ExxonMobil reined supreme in terms of market capitalization, clocking in at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively.\n\nNow, just 20 years later, a review of the chart toppers helps illustrate the changing of the guard. Tech titans Apple and Microsoft are currently in a class by themselves, with market caps of $3 trillion each (as of Thursday morning). A review of the top 10 provides further evidence of tech's dominance, as seven of the top 10 are industry-leading technology companies.\n\nOver the past year or so, one of the biggest drivers of stock market gains has been advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The potential for widespread productivity gains is causing a stir, and accelerating adoption could boost the next cohort of \"three trillionaires.\" There are two stocks that I believe will be fueled by the growing demand for AI and join this exclusive group over the next seven years, if not sooner. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) current market cap is $1.54 trillion, so it could eventually join the $3 trillion club, though the timing is a matter of some debate. The stock would need to increase by roughly 95% from Wednesday's closing price to reach that benchmark, amounting to approximately 10% gains annually between now and 2030, which is still easily within the realm of possibility.\n\nThat's not to say there won't be challenges along the way. One of the biggest headwinds may be the stock's recent rally, as Nvidia gained 239% last year alone. However, its importance in the field of AI can't be overstated. In each of the past two quarters, the company has generated triple-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth, and management is forecasting for more of the same.\n\nNvidia serves multiple markets, each of which represents a growth opportunity. Nvidia has long held a commanding lead in the discrete desktop graphics processing unit (GPU) space, recently controlling more than 80% of the market. However, record sales during the pandemic and the subsequent downturn caused an industrywide slump. Now, after nearly three years of successive declines, GPU shipments are finally beginning to rebound, which should help drive Nvidia higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it's the combination of AI and cloud computing that could really drive the company to new heights. Nvidia has established itself as the gold standard for AI and is the go-to for helping data move through the ether -- but don't take my word for it. The company has an estimated 95% share of the GPU data center market -- which forms the foundation for cloud computing -- according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. Furthermore, Nvidia is unmatched when it comes to processors used for machine learning -- an established method used by many AI tools -- with an estimated market share of 95%, according to New Street Research. It was these credentials that made Nvidia the natural choice for accelerating generative AI.\n\nWhile estimates vary, it's clear there are trillions of dollars at stake. Analysts at Morgan Stanley suggest generative AI represents a $6 trillion opportunity, while Goldman Sachs estimates the market is worth $7 trillion. As the leading provider of AI processors, Nvidia is in the catbird seat.\n\nData centers and cloud infrastructure providers are scrambling to increase the capacity of their systems to meet the computational demands of generative AI. This trend is expected to continue for years, giving Nvidia the fuel it needs to join the $3 trillion club.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) currently has a market cap is $1.63 trillion, and many believe it's merely a matter of time before the company is admitted to the $3 trillion club. To reach that benchmark, the stock would only need to increase by roughly 85% from Wednesday's closing price. That works out to about 10% gains annually between now and 2030, a hurdle that's well within Amazon's reach.\n\nThere are numerous catalysts that could fuel the company's future growth. Decades-high inflation caused people to make difficult choices in order to make ends meet, which put a pinch on consumer spending. This, in turn, hurt Amazon's industry-leading online retail business. There are signs the economy is finally on the mend, with Amazon experiencing an 11% lift in its e-commerce sales in the first three quarters of 2023. Further improvement in the economic outlook could provide an additional boost.\n\nGlobal e-commerce sales are expected to climb more than 9% in 2024, topping $6.3 trillion. As the world's largest digital retailer, Amazon is well positioned to ride the wave of e-commerce growth.\n\nAnother growth area for the company is the digital transformation, led by cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global leader in cloud infrastructure services, with 31% of the market, according to data supplied by market analytics firm Canalys. In the face of the economic downturn, many businesses scaled back on cloud spending, but growth is returning. Spending on cloud services increased 16% in the third quarter of 2023 and is expected to accelerate further as economic conditions improve. As the industry leader, Amazon is poised to benefit from the trend.\n\nPerhaps the biggest potential growth driver for Amazon is generative AI. The technology has proven effective at summarizing emails and drafting responses, searching the internet and company storehouses for data, and even writing and debugging computer code, with new use cases being discovered every day. The result has been a mad dash to adopt these AI models. However, the cost to create these systems from scratch is prohibitive, as are the mountains of data necessary to train foundational generative AI models.\n\nAs a result, cloud providers, including AWS, are best suited to provide generative AI services to users. Amazon already offers dozens of these models and has rolled out a growing suite of tools to help its cloud customers benefit from AI.\n\nThe recovery of the e-commerce market, a rebound in cloud spending, and the growing adoption of AI should give Amazon the necessary momentum to join the $3 trillion club.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Finding undervalued AI stocks may seem like a search to find a unicorn as valuations in this space are very elevated. Many of the world’s best AI companies are fetching massive premiums, even relative to other high-growth tech sectors.\n\nHowever, there are still AI-related stocks that have compelling valuations, or are simply overlooked by the market. As AI continues to prosper, it’s worth diving into which stocks are the best to buy and hold in 2024 and beyond\n\nAccording to expert analysis and predictions, the artificial intelligence industry has yet to develop and acquire more growth. In fact, an increase of up to $2 trillion in 2030 is expected from this sector. In 2023, the industry was at $207.9 billion — and could double in 2024. Thus, investing in high quality AI stocks that are overlooked is a strategy many investors are after.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s dive into three undervalued AI stocks that can provide excellent for growth investors over the next five to ten years.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are plenty of customer relationship management (CRM) companies in the market, but one rules them all: Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). As the most prominent CRM player globally, Salesforce has smoothly streamlined AI into its services, making business functionality more efficient. From sales management to customer support, Salesforce provides smoother workflows for business and teams.\n\nIn Q3 2024 ending October 31, 2023, the company posted an impressive $8.72 billion revenue. This is an immediate green flag if you’re looking to buy an AI stock. The company’s revenue grew an impressive 11% over the previous year, driving strong profitability. Analysts also expect the company to generate $9.56 earnings per share in 2024. At that level, Saleforce’s price-earnings ratio improves from a trailing 100-times to less than 30-times.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce has a high-profile partnership with Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN), deepening the company’s expansion in AI integrations. Its new data cloud products, Data Cloud and Einstein GPT Copilots, are also gaining popularity, delivering upsell opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nGuardforce AI (GFAI) Stock Photo ID: 1659535744 Industrial technology concept. Container terminal. Logistics. Communication network. Secured logistics. GFAI stock.\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite being perceived as risky, Guardforce AI (NASDAQ:GFAI) may actually be one of the most undervalued AI stocks to own. Why? Simply because the company is an integrated security provider that specializes in secured logistics. With its robotics-based security, Guardforce is truly distinct from other AI companies, and this positions the company well ahead of many of its competitors.\n\nAnalyst sentiment is improving around this AI name. In fact, Wall Street analysts anticipate the stock to increase to $14 in the near future. The company is also proud of its financial performance, driving revenue up to $18.4 million and swapping $13.4 million worth of debt into restricted shares.\n\nMoreover, Guardforce collaborated with Concorde Security in Singapore. The deal aims to provide robotic security solutions that can manage visitors, do chores like disinfecting and janitorial tasks, and more. Such collaboration should have a positive effect on both companies, and makes GFAI stock an intriguing, yet speculative, pick in this sector to consider.\n\nBigBear Holdings (BBAI) AI stocks to Buy, Close-up of letters \"AI\" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks. ai chip stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\n\nDespite being new and smaller than other AI companies, BigBear Holdings (NYSE:BBAI) holds untapped potential many investors are missing out on. BigBear’s key value is its core business model which focuses on three important markets: cybersecurity and autonomous systems, along with logistics and supply chains.\n\nThe company also has a large customer base, composed of both government and commercial sectors. BigBear had an excellent Q1 2023 report and has shown positive net income, cash from operations and EBITDA. Revenue is expected to reach $170 million. In November 2023, the company also acquired Pangiam, which provided biometrics and facial recognition software. The partnership aims to enable visual AI services, which will give significant boost and gains for BBAI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "One of the biggest investment themes in 2023 was artificial intelligence (AI). Each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks is playing a role in AI, and they helped fuel the Nasdaq Composite over 40% last year. This momentum seems to have carried over into 2024. The S&P 500 recently hit a new all-time high, and investors are probably wondering where they can find some value.\n\nAmong mega-cap tech enterprises, one in particular sticks out. E-commerce and cloud computing specialist Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has a lot of exciting catalysts that I think are overlooked, relative to cohorts such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Nvidia.\n\nLet's look at why scooping up shares in Amazon stock right now could be a lucrative opportunity.\n\nAmazon's secret profit machine\n\nAmazon might be best-known for its online e-commerce store. However, the company has many other operations that make meaningful contributions to the overall business. Perhaps the most important of these other ventures is the company's cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAlthough AWS has dominated the cloud computing industry for many years -- fending off stiff competition from Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle -- the last couple of years have not come without challenges. The macroeconomy has been subject to several rounds of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve as it looks to combat inflation.\n\nAs such, businesses of all sizes have been operating under tighter budgets and more stringent cost controls. This dynamic affected the technology landscape in particular, as demand for expensive software platforms started to wane. Unsurprisingly, growth in AWS started to decline and significantly affected Amazon's overall cash flow.\n\nDespite a turbulent economy, the back half of 2023 carried some positive momentum. Inflation has been cooling for several months now, and the rising interest in AI applications injected some much-needed life into AWS in particular. In fact, between the second and third quarter of 2023, Amazon tripled its free cash flow. Although e-commerce accounts for the majority of the company's revenue, it's AWS that contributes the most in operating profits. Through the first nine months of 2023, AWS generated more than 70% of Amazon's total operating income.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough results for the fourth quarter have not yet been released, I am optimistic that AWS will clock in another stellar performance. Amazon's progress on the AI front, albeit quiet, should not be discounted among the competition. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bedrock of AI\n\nWhen it comes to the biggest technology companies, it seems that the AI chatter largely centers around Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Following its multi-billion-dollar investment in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT -- a year ago, Microsoft has been on a relentless mission to integrate the technology across its Windows operating system. Additionally, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has repeatedly spoken about his conviction in Alphabet and the company's AI vision.\n\nBut Amazon, for its part, has made some savvy moves of its own. In September, the company announced that it was investing $4 billion in a rival to OpenAI, called Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will be using Amazon as its primary cloud provider and will train future generative AI models on the AWS cloud.\n\nFurthermore, the partnership with Anthropic ultimately serves as a lead generation funnel for Amazon's newest cloud development, called Bedrock. Bedrock is a managed services platform that provides developers with a host of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI applications, all housed under one umbrella.\n\nGiven the newness of the Anthropic relationship, long-term investors should be encouraged by the prospects the start-up can bring to AWS as it looks to return to accelerated growth.\n\nShould you invest in Amazon stock?\n\nAmazon is truly one of the most interesting case studies in recent corporate history. The company began as an online bookseller, eventually evolving into an e-commerce pioneer offering all sorts of different products. Over the years, the company expanded beyond online shopping and now has advanced businesses across cloud infrastructure, media and entertainment, advertising, logistics, and more. And as Amazon built this platform, the stock price generally rose. The chart below illustrates that since its initial public offering (IPO), Amazon stock is up over 160,000%. AMZN Chart\n\nOne of the most important concepts demonstrated by this chart is the power of holding strong conviction positions for long periods of time.\n\nAccording to the company's leadership, \"90% of the global IT spend still resides on premises. If you believe, like we do, that equation is going to flip, there's a lot more there for us.\" This dynamic underscores the greenfield opportunities Amazon has ahead as it relates to the intersection of cloud computing and generative AI. So even though AWS is a nearly $100 billion run-rate revenue business, I think it's just getting started.\n\nAs of this writing, Amazon stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.9 -- well below its long-term average of 4.2. The chart above, and the themes explored in this article, support a long-term bull thesis for Amazon. The company has clearly demonstrated its ability to innovate while creating new and profitable business segments.\n\nGiven the demand fueling AI and its expanding proliferation, I see Amazon as very well-positioned to dominate among tech leaders in the long run. Now looks like a fantastic opportunity to scoop up shares at an attractive valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Will Lead the New Bull Market",
        "content": "It's official: A new bull market is here. And part of the reason for that is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis roundtable panel of Motley Fool contributors agrees that AI stocks will lead this new bull market. But will the AI stocks that led the market out of the doldrums and toward the recent highs be the same stocks that will carry the bull market forward? Or will new AI stocks emerge as market leaders? See why Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are top picks now. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nAmazon stands to benefit from the growth of AI\n\nJake Lerch (Amazon): I think 2024 will see a massive transformation for AI, and that's why I'm picking Amazon as the AI stock that will lead this new bull market.\n\nIn short, the commercialization of AI is just starting. Relatively few AI products are available right now, but that's changing rapidly. Microsoft is now offering AI-powered Copilot features in its Office software, CrowdStrike's security modules utilize machine learning to prevent hacking, and Adobe has several multimedia tools that use generative AI. Countless other AI-driven products will soon be available for retail and enterprise customers.\n\nAmazon, the world's largest cloud services provider and the world's largest e-commerce company, should benefit in several ways:\n\nCloud spending could accelerate as businesses ramp up spending on generative AI, which runs on the cloud. And, crucially, cloud spending is one of Amazon's fastest-growing revenue sources. E-commerce spending could get a boost from the rise of AI-driven digital marketing, known as programmatic advertising, which helps advertisers serve better and more targeted ads. More e-commerce spending should lead to higher revenue for Amazon. Robotics innovations could lead to massive cost savings. Amazon is already America's second-largest employer, with over 1.5 million employees. However, it already uses over 750,000 robots in its sprawling warehouse network. Expect more robots -- run by AI -- going forward; that could lead to higher profits for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's enormous scale -- and the diversified nature of its business model (primarily split between e-commerce and the cloud) -- means the company will capture additional revenue as AI technology matures. Moreover, the company's own AI innovations and outside robotics advancements could help the company become more efficient, meaning bigger profits for the company and bigger returns for Amazon shareholders.\n\nThis stock is up over 300% and could continue to soar\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): The social media giant and AI innovator is an obvious pick to lead the new bull market because it's already doing it. The stock bottomed at roughly $90, along with the broader market, in late 2022. It's rallied over 300% since then.\n\nRemarkably, Meta Platforms is arguably still undervalued today. The company found itself in Wall Street's dog house when advertising struggles amid iPhone software changes and frivolous spending cratered Meta's free cash flow between mid-2022 and early 2023. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThe remedy? CEO Mark Zuckerberg aggressively cut expenses and leaned in to AI to counter Meta's iPhone privacy headwinds and get the company's financials back on track. Now, analysts are optimistic again about Meta's future, estimating a 20% long-term average annual earnings growth rate.\n\nThat's an enticing 1.1 PEG ratio, based on the stock's forward P/E of only 22. In other words, Meta's stock was so beaten down at its low that shares are still a bargain despite their meteoric rebound.\n\nAs long as Meta continues performing and can meet analyst estimates, the stock is poised to help lead this new bull market.\n\nInvestors should not forget the AI chip leader\n\nWill Healy(Nvidia): When it comes to AI stocks, one might think they missed out on Nvidia. The semiconductor stock rose by almost 240% in 2023, and with it rising an additional 25% so far in 2024, one might assume its run will plateau in the near future.\n\nDon't be so sure.\n\nAI-capable chips are essential to supporting the technology, and late last year, a Raymond James analyst estimated Nvidia controlled more than 85% of the generative AI accelerator chip market. Admittedly, that success has attracted competitors. Companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have taken notice and seek to take away some of that business with their own lines of AI chips.\n\nNonetheless, with Nvidia's market lead, these companies will probably struggle to challenge its dominance in the near term. Moreover, Allied Market Research estimates a 38% compound annual growth rate in the AI chip market through 2030.\n\nSuch a growth rate makes it easier for Nvidia to shrug off any potential competition, and seems to reinforce the optimism. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29), the company reported $39 billion in revenue, an 86% increase versus year-ago levels.\n\nOver the same time frame, net income exceeded $17 billion, a huge increase from the $3 billion it earned during the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nAdditionally, analysts forecast revenue will grow at 119% during the current fiscal year. Although it is likely to slow down, they predict revenue will rise by an additional 57% in fiscal 2025, indicating the rapid increases will continue.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to the surge in net income, Nvidia's valuation has fallen significantly. Its P/E ratio had exceeded 240 as recently as July. Today, the earnings multiple stands at 81, and its forward P/E ratio has fallen to 50.\n\nAs long as net income continues to skyrocket, these multiples will likely decline further, making the burgeoning AI-driven opportunity in Nvidia stock a much safer choice.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Warren Buffett Stock That Could Go Parabolic in 2024",
        "content": "Admittedly, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is not an obvious stock to see making a \"parabolic\" move. Its $1.6 trillion market cap implies a size that makes huge surges in the stock price more difficult to execute. But the more you dig down and take a closer look at its business model, the better chance you have of convincing investors that such a move is possible.\n\nOne investor who belatedly caught on to Amazon's potential was Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. His company first became an investor in 2019. Buffett and his lieutenants likely saw that Amazon's business model yielded most of its profits from a relatively small segment of the company.\n\nThe continued growth of that segment, as well as some surprising growth from a few other newer segments under its e-commerce umbrella, are increasing revenue rapidly. It's these factors that could eventually lead to parabolic growth for this internet and direct marketing retail stock.\n\nAmazon's path to rapid growth\n\nInvestors can probably understand what Buffett likes about this business simply by looking at its business model. Although the public knows Amazon best for e-commerce, it is one of the least profitable parts of the company. While e-commerce accounts for the largest share of Amazon's revenue, but it grows more slowly and it is expensive to keep it operating efficiently, sometimes even generating losses.\n\nInstead, its profit center is Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS pioneered the cloud computing industry, and with its higher operating margins, it accounts for most of the company's operating income.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2023, AWS made up $67 billion of Amazon's $405 billion in revenue in the same period, about 17% of the total. However, AWS earned $17 billion of the $24 billion in operating income earned by Amazon.\n\nAlso, even among Amazon's two e-commerce segments, North America and International, the most rapid revenue growth comes from services. In the first three quarters of 2023, third-party seller services, subscription services, and advertising combined made up approximately $158 billion in sales, slightly less than the $161 billion from online sales during that time. Still, yearly revenue growth for each of the service businesses was well into the double digits, while online sales grew at just 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon did not break down operating income for each business, but it is possible that such services are the profit drivers in the e-commerce segments. In either case, it shows that comparatively smaller segments drive the majority of operating income. This makes income growth easier to achieve than it would be for other companies of Amazon's size.\n\nGrowth prospects for Amazon stock\n\nBuffett tends to like stocks that maintain their appeal in all business cycles, but a strong performance is a bonus. Like many growth stocks, improved business conditions seemed to have helped Amazon. The bear market bottom for the stock occurred in late 2022, and over the last year, it has risen by approximately 60%, far above the S&P 500 index's total return of around 25%.\n\nAdmittedly, its P/E ratio of 80 may deter some investors from buying. Still, high earnings multiples are nothing new for the company. Hence, investors are unlikely to sour on the company for this reason anytime soon.\n\nMoreover, analysts anticipate enough earnings growth that the forward P/E ratio is 43. This is well below 2021 levels when the forward earnings multiple often exceeded 80, implying more room for the stock to surge higher.\n\nCan Amazon stock go parabolic?\n\nAlthough no stock analyst can promise a stock will go parabolic, Amazon's large size has not blunted the potential for such gains. Indeed, smaller companies have an advantage in this area since they are better able to drive higher-percentage growth rates.\n\nNonetheless, Amazon is like a smaller company in that its growth comes from its smaller businesses. Thus, its largest segment by revenue, online sales, can serve as a loss leader that helps drive revenue for higher-growth segments. Additionally, with Amazon's forward P/E ratio at a lower level historically, it can rise rapidly without reaching historical highs in valuation.\n\nTime will tell if the increases meet a \"parabolic\" standard. Still, Amazon remains well positioned to deliver market-beating returns for the foreseeable future, which should give investors like Buffett good reason to stay with Amazon and add shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Turnaround Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in 2024",
        "content": "After an encouraging rally to end 2023, the major indexes continued their winning streak in the new year. The Nasdaq Composite is just a couple of percentage points from setting new highs, up 36% over the past 12 months.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU), and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) are leaders in their respective markets spanning e-commerce, cloud services, and entertainment. These companies are reporting improving business results, but their share prices still trade at discounts from their previous peak.\n\nHere's why these three turnaround stocks offer investors significant upside over the next few years.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon stock has had a good run over the last year, rising 61%, but it's still 16% off its previous high in 2021. An improving outlook in its most profitable business could send the stock to new highs in 2024.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading cloud services provider, with over 30% share of the market, according to Synergy Research. AWS helps companies get more value out of their data to improve products and customer experiences, but Amazon's investments in AI technology are only just beginning to pay off.\n\nThe AWS segment saw operating income jump 29% year over year in 2023's third quarter. It is now at $87 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, with a long runway of growth ahead.\n\nAmazon has invested heavily in its own AI processors and services to capitalize on growing demand. Amazon Bedrock allows companies to use their own data to make custom large language models for AI applications. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the third-quarter earnings call that the number of companies building generative AI apps on AWS is \"substantial and growing very quickly.\"\n\nThe future is bright for Amazon, and that is starting to be reflected in the stock price. The shares still trade at a reasonable price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.90, which is still below Amazon's 10-year average P/S ratio of 3.14.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Amazon's e-commerce business also starting to show improving growth coming out of the economic slump last year, investors should expect to see more new highs over the next few years.\n\n2. Roku\n\nThe future of TV is quickly moving toward streaming, as just about every major network has followed Netflix's lead and launched a streaming service. This is a major growth opportunity for Roku, which makes most of its revenue from advertising. Over the long term, advertising will move to where viewers are spending time, but a weak ad market in 2022 delayed Roku's growth plans, sending the stock down 79% over the last three years.\n\nInvesting in companies that make money from advertising can be a profitable move during a weak economy. This is because the U.S. TV market is worth $60 billion. Brands may push the pause button occasionally, but companies will never stop advertising. This means a comeback is due for this popular streaming brand.\n\nRoku's advantage is that it has the eyeballs to win over a sizable share of the ad dollars that will shift to streaming services. It reaches nearly half of U.S. broadband households. Roku is winning over viewers with free ad-supported content through The Roku Channel, which saw total streaming hours grow 50% year over year last quarter.\n\nThe stock has rallied 61% over the last 12 months, which I would look at as validation of the company's opportunity. Roku stock offers significant upside over the next five years coming out of the recent downturn.\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nWhile there are probably not any e-commerce businesses that can hold a candle to Amazon, China is one area of the world that Amazon hasn't been able to crack. That's because Alibaba dominates the Chinese market with a market share of nearly 50%, according to Statista.\n\nAlibaba operates several business units across logistics and entertainment, but its e-commerce businesses, including Taobao and Tmall, contributed two-thirds of its total revenue last year. Alibaba's Tmall relies on third parties to sell goods, where it earns a high margin charging commissions and fees on each transaction. This lends itself to a highly profitable business, where Alibaba generated $30 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters.\n\nHowever, the company's leading role in China's digital economy also means it's vulnerable to a weak economy. Slowing growth, along with the uncertain regulatory environment in China, has sent the stock well off its highs. This is a great opportunity to buy one of the leading tech giants in the world at a bargain price.\n\nAlibaba's massive reach in China's e-commerce market could set up a big comeback. Across all business segments, revenue increased 9% year over year in the September-ending quarter, with Alibaba's international commerce business growing 53%. Moreover, the company's operating profit jumped 34% year over year, further supporting the value underpinning the share price right now.\n\nAs China's economy emerges from pandemic-related disruptions, Alibaba stock offers significant upside. The shares currently trade at a cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5. This is a top turnaround candidate to bet on in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently have jumped into the AI spotlight, representing promising AI bets.\n\nNvidia makes the chips that power the technology, and Amazon uses AI to improve its operations and serve its customers. Their shares have climbed 218% and 62%, respectively, over the past year, but these market giants still have room to run. If you could pick up only one of these stocks today, which makes the better AI buy? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long powered the worlds of gaming and graphics. But these chips' ability to divide work among processors and carry out several tasks at the same time -- leading to tremendous speed -- soon launched them into a broad range of applications across industries. And one of those areas is AI.\n\nThanks to Nvidia's top chip performance, the company holds more than 80% of the AI chip market, according to analysts. Sure, rivals -- such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) -- exist. But Nvidia could stay ahead for several reasons. The company already is a leader, so satisfied customers may not be eager to switch to another chipmaker. We've seen this trend already among chip customers in the world of central processing units -- AMD has been unable to unseat Intel over the years.\n\nFinally, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels and instead significantly invests in research and development (R&D) to stay ahead of the competition and continue innovating. In the most recent quarter (period ended Oct. 29), Nvidia's  R&D spending increased 18% to more than $2.2 billion. At the same time, the company's operating income outpaced operating expenses, and net income surged more than 1,000% year over year. So Nvidia can afford to continue investing to stay on top while delivering earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nAmazon has invested in AI for its own use and to serve its customers. The e-commerce giant uses AI to streamline operations at its fulfillment centers and to design the most efficient delivery routes for packages, for example. These and other ways of using AI help Amazon reduce costs, therefore boosting earnings.\n\nThe e-commerce business also uses AI to help a customer find the right item by generating suggestions based on what they've bought in the past -- that could keep them coming back, again adding to Amazon's earnings potential.\n\nAI also is a big part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing business. AWS offers various AI tools to clients so they don't have to build from the ground up or manage infrastructure.\n\nAmazon has made itself present in every layer of AI. It's created chips, such as the Trainium, to train large language models (LLM). It's launched an LLM service, Amazon Bedrock, which features top foundation models that customers can customize for their own use. And AWS offers applications that run the LLMs such as Code Whisperer, a coding assistant for developers.\n\nIn Amazon's most recent earnings call, the company said generative AI remains a priority for AWS customers -- and AWS, as the cloud market leader, is in the perfect position to benefit.\n\nNvidia or Amazon?\n\nNvidia and Amazon both are set for success in the world of AI. Both companies also are profitable and have a solid track record of revenue growth. NVDA Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nBut if I had to choose the biggest AI winner, I would go for Nvidia. That's because the company dominates in a key area: It powers AI training, the \"deep learning\" that will give those AI models the ability to perform. Nvidia is an expert in GPUs, already is a step ahead of rivals, and has the financial situation to invest in R&D to maintain its leadership.\n\nToday, Nvidia trades for 50x forward earnings estimates, compared to 43x for Amazon, but the tech giant is worth the premium -- making it the top AI stock to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- It’s set to be an action-packed week in markets with the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, a flurry of big tech earnings and the latest U.S. jobs report. The Bank of England also holds its first policy meeting of 2024 while data out of China is expected to remain gloomy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.\n\nFed ahead\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.\n\nInvestors have pushed expectations for the Fed’s first rate cut to May from March following recent strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that cuts may not be as aggressive as expected.\n\nData on Friday indicated that inflation is moderating but consumer spending remains robust, leading to concerns that price pressures could begin to mount again.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post policy meeting press conference for any insights into how officials have been interpreting recent economic data.\n\nJobs report\n\nHard on the heels of the Fed decision the U.S. is to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.\n\nThe recent stock market rally which has powered the S&P 500 to record highs has been driven by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.\n\nA weaker than expected reading could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe economic calendar also includes data on JOLTS job openings and consumer confidence on Tuesday, followed a day later by a report on private sector payrolls and weekly data on initial jobless claims on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nMegacap earnings\n\nEarnings will be a major focal point in the week ahead with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.\n\nWith the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum.\n\nCollectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.\n\n\"There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Reuters. \"If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose\" for the market as a whole.\n\nBank of England\n\nThe BoE is expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday and while it may drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds it is expected to indicate that rates need to remain restrictive for an extended period.\n\nThe latest U.K. jobs report showed that wage growth rose at the slowest pace in almost a year in the three months to November, but inflation unexpectedly rose to 4% in December.\n\nBritain's economy started 2024 on a stronger footing but data last week indicated that supply disruptions in the Red Sea are reigniting inflation in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe BoE raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023, taking rates to a peak of 5.25% after inflation surged to a 41-year high of 11.1% in late 2022.\n\nChina PMIs\n\nChina is to release official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday that is likely to show that the world’s second largest economy remains on a shaky footing.\n\nChina's economy expanded by 5.2% in 2023, but its post-pandemic recovery has been shaky, with a protracted housing downturn, mounting deflationary risks and slowing global growth casting clouds over the outlook for this year.\n\nChina's central bank announced last Wednesday that it was making a 50-basis point cut to bank reserves, the biggest in two years, sending a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and the country's plunging stock markets.\n\nStill, analysts say more stimulus is needed this year to get economic activity on more solid footing.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nUS reviewing Venezuelan sanctions policy in wake of court decision - State Dept\n\nFrench farmers keep Paris roadblock threat as protests endure",

This would mark the fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline for the company.\n\nGoing into earnings, our flagship ProTips tool warns of the company's high multiples and weakening margins.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nApple has recently lost the title of the world's largest company by market share to rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which reports on Tuesday prior.

However, the company's GF Score of 19/100 indicates potential challenges in future performance.

Baillie Gifford Bolsters Position in Warby Parker Inc\n\nWarby Parker Inc's Company Overview\n\nWarby Parker Inc, known for its innovative approach to eyewear, operates at the nexus of design, technology, healthcare, and social enterprise. Since its IPO on September 29, 2021, the company has been dedicated to offering designer prescription glasses, contacts, eye exams, and vision tests. Warby Parker generates revenue primarily through the sales of eyewear products and optical services, leveraging both physical stores and digital platforms.

However, the company's overall performance since its IPO has declined by 76%. Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s increased stake in Warby Parker, now at 0.06% of its portfolio, suggests a belief in the company's potential for recovery and growth despite the current market challenges.\n\nMarket Performance of Warby Parker Inc\n\nWarby Parker's stock currently trades at $12.97, which is higher than the trade price of $11.05.

It's no longer a solely e-commerce investment, as it has other dominant business segments like advertising and cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, or AWS). Both businesses have higher margins than e-commerce, so Amazon's profit margins are seeing massive increases over time. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nUnlike previous periods when Amazon achieved high margins, this margin boost isn't influenced by external factors. Instead, it has all been powered by efficiency improvements and it looks sustainable.\n\nInvestors have yet to see what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, and I think 2024 could be a glimpse into that future. That's why I purchased the stock now.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is better known by its former name and main business segment, Google. While Alphabet may have artificial intelligence (AI) investments and a cloud computing division (Google Cloud), it's still primarily an advertising company, with nearly 80% of its revenue coming from ads. In late 2022 and through the first half of 2023, this was a bad business to be in, as companies were cutting ad budgets in preparation for a recession.\n\nHowever, that recession didn't come, and these clients are starting to open up their ad budgets again, boosting Alphabet's business. In Q3, Alphabet's ad revenue rose 9.5%, getting the company back on track to produce respectable growth. Alongside other efficiency improvements, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) rose from $1.06 to $1.55.\n\nThe return of ad-spending plus continuous efficiency improvements have given Alphabet a cheap price tag of 22 times forward earnings, which makes it a promising buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is a top company in Latin America, and its e-commerce, logistics, digital wallet, and consumer credit businesses have become dominant products in their respective fields. When many companies' growth slowed in 2023, MercadoLibre was still full speed ahead -- it never saw its revenue growth rate dip below 50% on a currency-neutral basis. In its latest quarter, it put up its fastest sales growth of the past year at 69% (from a currency-neutral basis).\n\nFurthermore, MercadoLibre has been improving margins, highlighted by its operating margin increase from 11% to 18.2% in Q3.\n\nDespite this success, MercadoLibre still trades at a lower price-to-sales valuation than most of the past decade. MELI PS Ratio Chart\n\nMercadoLibre still looks like a screaming deal now, and I'd have no problem adding even more to my position (even if it is already one of my largest positions right now).\n\ndLocal\n\ndLocal (NASDAQ: DLO) is a company few have heard of, but it is a true hidden gem. dLocal's software allows its customers (including Amazon, Google, Shopify,Spotify, and Nike) to sell their products in locations with less developed digital payment infrastructure.\n\nWhile each of these companies could build its own solution for countries like India, Indonesia, or Kenya, it's far easier to concede a small amount of revenue to dLocal in exchange for their systems already being tailored for each country.\n\nThis has proven wildly successful, and dLocal's financials tell a clear story. In Q3, dLocal's revenue rose 47% year over year to $164 million, and net income increased 25% to $40.4 million. That gives dLocal a respectable profit margin of 25%.\n\nDespite its excellent growth, strong profitability, and great business model, dLocal trades for just 22 times forward earnings, making it a great bargain.\n\nUiPath\n\nFinally, UiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a leader in the robotic process automation (RPA) space. This technology allows its users to automate repetitive tasks, and it has AI plug-ins to increase the number of tasks it can automate.\n\nIt's a favorite stock of Cathie Wood and her team at Ark Invest, and this stock is currently the second-largest position across all of Ark's portfolios. The company is growing at a brisk pace, with annual recurring revenue rising 24% to $1.38 billion in Q3 of FY 2024 (ending October 31). It also has a healthy net retention rate, with the average customer spending $121 for every $100 they spent last year.\n\nAs companies look to improve efficiency and integrate AI, UiPath will be a logical choice. The company's business should benefit from this trend throughout 2024 and beyond. However, UiPath's stock doesn't garner a massive premium like many AI-related stocks, trading for a reasonable 11 times sales today.\n\nSo UiPath is a great investment right now, and it could make you look like a genius if you buy and hold it for the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Could PDD (Pinduoduo) Become the Next Amazon?",
        "content": "PDD(NASDAQ: PDD), more commonly known as Pinduoduo, is China's third largest e-commerce company by annual revenue after Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD). However, it's still growing faster than both those market leaders.\n\nPDD was founded just nine years ago, but it carved out a niche with its discount marketplace before expanding into the online agricultural space. From 2018 to 2022, its annual revenue grew at a stunning compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 78%, and analysts expect 81% growth in 2023. PDD also turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2021, and its net profit nearly quadrupled in 2022. Analysts expect its earnings to rise another 49% in 2023. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThose growth rates are impressive, but can PDD continue to expand and replace Alibaba and JD as the \"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) of China\"? Let's compare PDD's business model and growth trajectory to Amazon's to find out.\n\nThe similarities and differences between PDD and Amazon\n\nPDD and Amazon are both massive e-commerce companies, but their underlying business models are quite different. Pinduoduo has primarily been a third-party marketplace ever since it phased out its lower-margin first-party marketplace to boost its profitability in 2021. Amazon still operates first-party and third-party marketplaces.\n\nPinduoduo's core marketplace encourages its shoppers to team up on social media platforms to score bulk discounts. That strategy enabled it to pull shoppers away from Alibaba and JD across China's lower-tier cities. Amazon usually only offers bulk discounts for businesses, but some of its sellers offer bulk discounts for certain items.\n\nPinduoduo doesn't operate any first-party brick-and-mortar stores, but Amazon operates its own stores (Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh), as well as Whole Foods Market. Both companies sell fresh produce online, but Amazon is mainly an intermediary grocer, while Pinduoduo directly connects farmers to shoppers through its own marketplace. That farm-to-table strategy enabled it to sell cheaper produce and become China's largest online agricultural platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nPDD has also been expanding overseas with Temu, a cross-border marketplace which enables its Chinese sellers to peddle their products to overseas buyers. Temu is now one of the most downloaded shopping apps in the U.S., Europe, and other markets. Amazon connects Chinese sellers to international buyers through its third-party marketplace.\n\nLastly, Amazon owns Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform. AWS has become Amazon's core profit engine over the past decade because it generates higher-margin revenue than its lower-margin marketplaces. PDD doesn't own a comparable cloud platform, but economies of scale have been boosting its total profits.\n\nPDD resembles Amazon in 2010\n\nAnalysts expect PDD to generate 235.8 billion yuan ($33.1 billion) in revenue in 2023. That would make it comparable to Amazon in 2010, when it generated $34.2 billion in revenue. Prior to that, Amazon had grown its revenue at a CAGR of 32% from 2005 to 2010 -- compared to PDD's projected five-year CAGR of 78% from 2018 to 2023.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2023, Amazon's revenue is expected to rise at a CAGR of 24% to $570.9 billion. If PDD also grows at the same CAGR of 24% over the next 13 years, it could generate 4 billion yuan ($562 billion) in revenue and be roughly comparable to today's Amazon by 2036. For now, analysts expect PDD's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 46% from 2022 to 2025 -- so it certainly seems to have a shot at becoming the \"next Amazon.\"\n\nBut it faces more unpredictable challenges than Amazon\n\nHowever, investors should be aware of the regulatory threats. PDD benefited from China's antitrust crackdown on Alibaba in 2021, which hobbled its top competitor by banning its aggressive promotions and exclusive deals with merchants. But if PDD grows larger than Alibaba, it could also be hit by similar antitrust fines and restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, its overseas expansion could be scrutinized by U.S. regulators if tensions between the U.S. and China continue to intensify. Alphabet's Google already suspended Pinduoduo's main app from its Play Store last year amid spyware concerns, while the prolific short seller Grizzly Research claimed that Temu contained spyware in a report last September.\n\nPDD tried to allay those concerns by moving its headquarters from Shanghai to Dublin last year, but it could still be widely seen as a Chinese company as long as it generates most of its revenue from China. That perception could hamper its overseas expansion and prevent it from becoming the next major catalyst for its long-term growth.\n\nCould PDD be the true \"Amazon of China\"?\n\nWith an enterprise value of $165 billion, PDD is still a lot smaller than Amazon, which is worth a whopping $1.68 trillion. Its stock is also reasonably valued at 22 times next year's earnings. The road ahead might be bumpy, but it has plenty of room to grow and could easily eclipse Alibaba and JD as the true \"Amazon of China\" over the next few decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PDD Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PDD Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PDD Holdings wasn't one of them.

        "title": "My Top Bull Market Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "A year ago, the markets were just beginning their recovery from bear times. Growth stocks started to take off, and investors wondered when we could officially call a bull market. Well, that time is now, offering us an excellent start to 2024. The S&P 500 recently hit a new record high, confirming the market is indeed in one of these much-awaited phases of optimism and growth.\n\nIn more good news, history shows us bull markets generally last longer than bear markets, offering our portfolios time to benefit. And to maximize your bull market potential, it's a great idea to buy shares of growth stocks. That's because they tend to excel in bull market environments and times of economic recovery and expansion. Here are my top growth stocks to buy in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a the ideal growth stock because it's a leader in two high-growth markets: e-commerce and cloud computing. The company also is investing heavily in the hot area of artificial intelligence (AI), which is boosting earnings in two ways.\n\nAI is driving efficiency in Amazon's operations, helping it to lower costs. And Amazon, through cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS), offers AI tools to clients. Considering the high demand in this area, AWS' AI tools could keep these clients coming back, boosting AWS' revenue. This is particularly important since AWS traditionally has driven profit at Amazon.\n\nAmazon's recent efforts to revamp its cost structure -- to fight rising inflation and other challenges -- have been bearing fruit. Back in 2022, the company reported its first annual loss in about a decade. But by early last year, Amazon already was reporting quarterly gains in net income, and its outflow of cash had shifted to an inflow. In the most recent quarter, the company's net income more than tripled, and free cash flow improved to an inflow of more than $21 billion. Return on invested capital also has been on the rise over the past year.\n\nStory continues AMZN Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nThese moves should benefit the company in better times, too. Amazon improved efficiency across its fulfillment network, for example switching to a regional model from a national model in the U.S. The shorter delivery distances are driving improvements in Amazon's \"cost to serve,\" and the company sees potential for ongoing progress here.\n\nSo, even though Amazon stock climbed last year, the potential for gains is far from over -- and the stock could be one to excel in this bull market.\n\n2. Carnival\n\nCarnival(NYSE: CCL) had a difficult time of it earlier in the pandemic when sailings were halted, but the world's biggest cruise operator has since roared back to growth. Demand for cruise vacations soared, as we can see in Carnival's revenue and bookings. In the most recent quarter -- the fiscal fourth quarter -- Carnival reported record revenue, and bookings in the two weeks around Black Friday hit an all-time high for that period.\n\nFor the fiscal year that ended in November, Carnival reported record revenue of more than $21 billion and entered the new year with its best booked position ever, taking into account occupancy and price. And this has helped the company make gains in earnings, for example, reporting a narrower-than-expected U.S. GAAP net loss of $74 million for the year and positive adjusted net income of $1 million.\n\nInvestors' biggest concern about Carnival has been the company's debt levels. While ships were docked during early pandemic days, Carnival built up a wall of debt just to stay afloat (excuse the pun). But Carnival has made significant progress here, too, cutting debt by $4.6 billion from its peak, and Carnival says ongoing growth in adjusted free cash flow will help it pay down more debt over time.\n\nCarnival's booking volumes and customer deposits, which also have reached records, are reason to be optimistic about earnings. And the company's other efforts to streamline operations and cut fuel costs add to earnings growth potential.\n\nThat's why now, as Carnival charges ahead in its recovery and growth story, is the perfect time to pick up this stock.\n\n3. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a market giant thanks to leading products like the iPhone and Mac computers, but that doesn't mean the company has reached a plateau when it comes to growth. In fact, three things are set to drive earnings growth well into the future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe first is Apple's brand strength, which helps keep Apple users coming back to buy the latest iPhone or Apple Watch instead of trying a rival product. This brand strength is part of Apple's moat, or competitive advantage -- a key element that could keep this company ahead over time.\n\nThe second growth driver is Apple's services business, which in the most recent quarter reported record revenue. This is because all of those loyal Apple fans also subscribe to certain services through their devices -- from digital content to cloud storage. The enormous user base Apple has built over the years (the installed base of active devices topped 2 billion) now represents a source of recurrent revenue.\n\nAnd, importantly, gross margins on services are higher than those on products -- 70% compared with 36% in the most recent quarter.\n\nFinally, Apple still continues to gain new customers, so it hasn't yet reached a maximum when it comes to gaining market share. In the quarter, half of Mac and iPad buyers were new to those products.\n\nConsidering all of this, Apple's growth story is set to be a long one, and the new bull market may be one of the most exciting chapters -- for the company and for shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "My Top-5 AI Growth Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist for 2024",
        "content": "The S&P 500 recently reached a new record high, signaling a bull market is here, and that means it's a fantastic time to bet on growth. Bull markets tend to favor growth stocks, and history shows us these times of market gains last longer than bear markets -- on average almost three years versus nine months. So there's reason right now to load up on stocks that may excel in this sort of environment and benefit from the momentum.\n\nThat's why I've got my eye on companies involved in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI) from chipmakers that power AI tools to companies using this technology to improve their operations. At a compound annual growth rate of about 21%, the AI market is forecast to reach more than $2 trillion by 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights. Companies investing now could greatly benefit down the road -- and so could you. Here are my top-five AI growth stocks to buy hand over fist for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is almost synonymous with AI these days. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) power the training of AI systems, the \"deep learning\" that allows them to understand complex concepts and deliver answers to our questions.\n\nNvidia has built an 80%-to-95% share of the AI chip market, according to analysts, and that's unlikely to change any time soon for two reasons. First, Nvidia now is a clear leader, so it may be difficult for rivals to attract customers away from the industry's \"go-to\" chipmaker. Second, Nvidia invests heavily in research and development (R&D), so it should stay ahead thanks to innovation too. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia's R&D spending increased 18% to more than $2.2 billion.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia's investments are bearing fruit, with return on invested capital soaring in recent times. NVDA Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nNVDA Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia's revenue has climbed over the past few years as it broadened its dominance from GPUs to power gaming and graphics to leadership in AI. And the company's profit has advanced too. Considering Nvidia's financial strength and AI market share, the stock is a no-brainer AI buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAI is helping Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) excel in both its e-commerce and cloud-computing businesses. The company has used AI in e-commerce for a while now, in everything from making warehouse operations and fulfillment more efficient to helping you, the customer, find just the right item. So, here, AI helps Amazon gain in efficiency, thereby lowering costs. By offering you a positive shopping experience, you're likely to come back. That's a double victory for Amazon's earnings.\n\nAs for cloud computing, Amazon has developed several AI tools that it offers its customers. For example, Amazon Bedrock gives clients access to top foundation models they can customize for their own use -- without having to build from the ground up or manage infrastructure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also offers Code Whisperer, a service that suggests code to developers, saving them valuable time.\n\nGenerative AI is \"top of mind\" for clients, Amazon said in its recent earnings call, so AWS, as the world's cloud-market leader, is in the perfect place to benefit in the years to come.\n\n3. Moderna\n\nModerna (NASDAQ: MRNA) may not be the first company that comes to mind when you think of AI. After all, it's a biotech developing vaccines based on mRNA technology. But Moderna actually could be a winner of the AI revolution and is investing in the technology today to increase its chances of that happening.\n\nModerna uses AI across its entire business, even launching an \"AI academy\" to train employees. But where AI really might change the game is in the area of drug development.\n\nModerna applies AI to explore relationships between the vast amounts of data it's collected over the years to produce better candidates. The company even signed a collaboration with International Business Machines (IBM) last year to use its AI tools. For example, an IBM foundation model can help predict a molecule's properties, helping scientists immediately understand the characteristics of a potential medicine.\n\nThe idea is AI can help Moderna more quickly identify the best candidates, and that may speed up the drug-development process, bringing products to market faster. This could score a win for Moderna, patients, and investors.\n\n4. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic(NYSE: MDT) is another potential winner in the AI-in-healthcare market -- a market expected to reach $208 billion in 2030 from $32 billion today, according to Grand View Research. Like Moderna, Medtronic has put the focus on this hot technology, creating an AI Center of Excellence.\n\nThe medical device giant created the center of excellence to cost-effectively drive AI innovation across its businesses with the goal of maintaining leadership in AI-enabled healthcare. Medtronic already uses AI across many of its products from the GI Genius endoscopy tool to the Touch Surgery Enterprise platform for AI-enabled surgery. So, it's well on the way to being a major player in the AI-in-healthcare revolution.\n\nOn top of this, you'll like the fact that Medtronic, following a transformation plan to become more efficient, may be heading into a new era of growth. In the most recent quarter, Medtronic reported growth across its business segments and geographies. Considering Medtronic's products hold Nos. 1 to 3 market-share positions, this performance may continue over time.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), parent of search giant Google, already has delivered an impressive track record of growth, as seen in the chart below. GOOG Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nGOOG Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nNow, AI may be set to deliver a new boost. Your searches on Google are about to garner even better results thanks to Alphabet's focus on this potentially game-changing technology. Alphabet recently unveiled its most powerful AI tool yet, Gemini, and tests of Gemini in search have resulted in improvements in quality and speed.\n\nWhy is this important? Google holds more than 90% of the search market right now, making it the leader by far. Supercharging Google search's capabilities should reinforce this leadership. That, in turn, should keep advertisers flocking to Google. Since this is Alphabet's biggest source of revenue, keeping Google search at the top of its game is crucial.\n\nAlphabet plans on applying Gemini across its products, from its smartphone to its cloud-computing offerings, so this investment in AI should go pretty far when it comes to driving growth. And that's why Alphabet is a top AI stock to buy this year in the new bull market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

In November 2023, Gabelli, while talking to CNBC, said that the US consumer is an incredibly strong position since the overall net worth of consumers in the country has gone up significantly over the past few years. However, Gabelli said income disparity in the US is high. Gabelli named several spending acts by the US government and said while the Fed is trying to reduce the aggregate demand, the amount of money the US government is putting in the system is having an opposite effect. Gabelli then went on to talk about the \"short-termism\" of the market and said while uncertainties remain and we cannot predict events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one can still make money investing in the stock market.\n\n\"You can make a lot of money in the market.. by doing simple things like buying specific stocks.\"\n\nBut how does Gabelli find \"specific stocks\" to invest in? GAMCO in a report highlighted that instead of always focusing on short-term earnings cycles and news, it focuses on true value of companies and positions itself for long-term earnings trends.\n\n\"We want to know everything and anything that will add to, or detract from, our valuation estimates. This method of analysis involves looking at businesses as a function of their assets and earnings power. We examine businesses as if we were owners of those businesses, and we believe that we can do that in a rational way by looking at industries on a global basis. Our investment professionals visit with hundreds of companies each year. Our work is proprietary, bottom up, and involves the full utilization of public resources. We calculate the Private Market Value (PMV) estimate of the business, which is what an informed strategic buyer would pay for a business in its entirety in a private transaction. Effectively, it is the intrinsic value plus a strategic premium. Finally, we look for a catalyst: something happening in the company’s industry or indigenous to the company itself that will help realize returns. A company’s PMV is not constant, and changes as a function of many variables. The objective is to identify large differences between our estimate of PMV and the stock market price. We then identify the catalyst to realize a return with minimal influence from the overall direction of the stock market. It is our belief that we can earn superior risk adjusted returns following this event-driven approach.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn another interview in August last year, Gabelli said that markets go up and down but what's important is that we want to invest in good companies with strong management and valuations. Gabelli said that there are opportunities beyond just the Magnificent Seven.

We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nBillionaire Gabelli’s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential 12 Best High Yield Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Gabelli Mario Gabelli Stock Portfolio: 10 Top Stock Picks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Billionaire Mason Hawkins’ 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theBillionaire Mason Hawkins' 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Billionaire Mason Hawkins' 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nOtis \"Mason\" Hawkins is a famous value investor who founded Southeastern Asset Management in 1975. Hawkins is estimated to be worth around $1.8 billion and his hedge fund had about $5.5 billion in assets under management as of March 2023. Southeastern Asset Management hunts for bottom-up opportunities around the globe, with the fund's core value and investing philosophy finding its roots in Benjamin Graham's value investing approach. Hawkins is among the traditional class of value investors who staunchly stick to age-old, tried and tested value investing principles. Back in 2008, Hawkins was asked during an interview how he examines intrinsic value of companies. The billionaire said he focuses on free cash flow as he and his team tries to project FCF for the next seven years, \"put a low or no growth terminal multiple on the business past 7 years, and discount back at a conservative discount rate.\"\n\n\"The second method calculates net asset value by adjusting book values of assets and liabilities to current liquidation values. (For example, real estate is rarely worth the original cost carried on the books, particularly if it’s been held for a long period.) Third, we check our longhand math against a data base of comparable transactions over the last 30 years, taking into account the interest rate environment at the time of the transactions. We mark our appraisal to the lower of the two values when comparable sales and our longhand math differ,\" Hawkins added.\n\nLongleaf Partners Funds, where Hawkins is a co-portfolio manager, is also a notable fund backed by Southeastern and regularly posts its performance and commentary on its website. The fund said in its Q4'2023 letter that it more than doubled the Russell 1000 Value Index, \"almost equalled the tech-led S&P 500 Index and approximately doubled\" its absolute return goal of inflation plus 10%. The fund said when everyone was busy worrying about recession, its team was finding contrarian opportunities:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our research team was busy in 2023. At the start of the year when everyone was still predicting an imminent recession, we saw opportunity as contrarians and improved our portfolio with weighting changes and compelling new investments, many of which have already contributed to the portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we have seen a growing consensus about a soft landing. This consensus view concerns us for the same reasons we were excited to be buying earlier in the year when everyone was fearful. However, we are confident in our ability to keep delivering double-digit returns with our portfolio of competitively advantaged, financially strong businesses with management teams that can take self-help measures in any environment. 2023 showed us that our investment approach can add meaningful value, even in a challenging period for bottom-up active equity managers.\" Mason Hawkins' Top Stocks with Upside Potential\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Mason Hawkins' Q3'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks with the highest upside potential from their current prices based on average analyst price estimates. Unlike many other hedge funds, Hawkins' top positions are not in stocks like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the value investor is looking at undervalued companies that are still under the radar. We ranked this list in ascending order of upside potential of these stocks. We also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors for these stocks. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $149\n\nUpside Potential: 6.43%\n\nBillionaire Mason Hawkins owns a $47 million stake in financial services company Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. Yahoo Finance data shows that Wall Street analysts have set a $149 price target on the stock for the next 12 months, while the stock was trading at around $137.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI).\n\nEarlier this month, Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform from Perform. Oppenheimer's analyst Dominick Gabriele said in his note that Fiserv Inc's (NYSE:FI) \"penetration expectation\" through 2026 is impressive and adds an \"upward upward bias for sustaining high total company margin expansion.\"\n\nGiverny Capital Asset Management made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Turning to our new positions, we have been following Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) for a couple of years now and finally bought a position during the third quarter. Fiserv has two businesses that reinforce each other: it is a key technology provider to several thousand global banks and credit unions. Mid-sized financial institutions need to offer a full complement of digital banking services to compete with larger national banks, but they can’t afford to build out an internal tech capacity. It’s more cost effective to outsource to Fiserv.\n\nFiserv’s other business is, broadly, payment processing: when you tap and pay at your favorite restaurant or retailer, you may be using a Fiserv device. That device, in turn, may connect directly to the business owner’s bank – and Fiserv built out the bank’s tech stack. The synergy here is important. Fiserv can sell terminals to the restaurant itself, but banks may also sell Fiserv products as part of their customer relationships. There is terrific distribution synergy\n\nFor the next few years, Fiserv’s growth should be led by Clover, a payments acceptance system that offers merchants faster transaction times, better fraud protection and stronger operational controls than many existing acceptance networks. While Clover is a clear leader in acceptance, it has a small market share today and could grow at double digit rates for some years. In turn, that should drive solid earnings growth for Fiserv. I believe the stock trades for a low-teens multiple of likely 2024 earnings, an attractive price for a steady compounder.”\n\n10. XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $96\n\nUpside Potential: 10.34%\n\nAmerican transportation company XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks in billionaire Mason Hawkins' portfolio with upside potential. According to Yahoo Finance, the stock's one-year average price estimate is $96. In October XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.88, beating estimates by $0.24. Revenue in the quarter jumped 1.7% year over year to $1.98 billion, surpassing estimates by $50 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Hawkins owns  a $1.2 million stake in XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO).\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our holdings in the industrials sector also contributed during the quarter. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO), which provides freight transportation services internationally, rallied on the news that industry competitor Yellow had filed for bankruptcy, resulting in market share gains for XPO.”\n\n9. Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $45.50\n\nUpside Potential: 15.14%\n\nAsset management company Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ) ranks eighth in our list of the top Mason Hawkins stocks with upside potential. The stock was trading at around $38.47 as of January 17 while its average price target set by analysts for the next 12 months is $45.50.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 13 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ). The biggest stakeholder of Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ) during this period was John W. Rogers' Ariel Investments which owns a $222 million stake in Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ).\n\n8. Affiliated Managers Group Inc (NYSE:AMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $176\n\nUpside Potential: 16.85%\n\nBillionaire Mason Hawkins owns a $118 million stake in investment management company Affiliated Managers Group Inc (NYSE:AMG). The stock was trading at around $147.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 28 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Affiliated Managers Group Inc (NYSE:AMG). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Affiliated Managers Group Inc (NYSE:AMG) was John W. Rogers' Ariel Investments which owns a $155 million stake.\n\nAriel Small Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Also in the quarter, we initiated a new position in boutique asset manager, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG). AMG has a unique business model in which it purchases meaningful equity interests in boutique asset management firms and in return receives a fixed percentage of revenues. The Company’s partnership approach allows for its affiliates’ management teams to own significant equity while maintaining operational independence. We believe AMG’s size and scale allow the company to be the leading destination for growing boutique firms addressing succession issues and/or seeking assistance in marketing, distribution and product development. In our view, investors currently underappreciate the company’s active and alternative-asset affiliate business model.”\n\n7. FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 67\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $297\n\nUpside Potential: 17.39%\n\nFedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) ranks seventh in our list of the best Mason Hawkins' stocks to buy with upside potential. Hawkins' fund owns a $158.1 million stake in FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).\n\nIn December FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said it plans to buy back $1 billion worth of shares.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 67 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).\n\nIn addition to FedEx, hedge funds also like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n6. Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $112\n\nUpside Potential: 25.84%\n\nEntertainment company Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) shares have gained about 19% over the past one year. They were trading at around $90.60 as of January 17. According to Yahoo Finance data, the stock's average analyst price estimate is $112.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 40 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) during this period was Robert Joseph Caruso's Select Equity Group which owns a $924 million stake in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV).\n\nRoth MKM recently upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral and upped its price target to $114 from $92.\n\nThe analyst said demand of live events over the next few years will be above-average.\n\nLike Live Nation, hedge funds also like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nBaron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Liberty Media Corporation-Liberty Live is a tracking stock created on 8/4/2023 representing Liberty Media Corporation’s holdings in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Billionaire Mason Hawkins' 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets 10 Stocks with 50% Upside Potential According to Analysts 12 Extreme Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "(Reuters) - MacKenzie Scott, ex-wife of Amazon.com billionaire Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, sold 65.3 million shares in the ecommerce giant last year, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.\n\nThe share sale forms about 25% of the philanthropist's Amazon stake in the e-commerce giant and would be worth $10.4 billion at Amazon's Friday closing price, the report said, citing a regulatory filing.\n\nReuters could not immediately confirm the filing. Scott did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nShe received a 4% stake in Amazon as part of her divorce from the company's founder in 2019. The stake, worth $36 billion at the time, made her one of the richest women in the world.\n\nScott, who pledged in 2019 to donate half her fortune to charity, has given millions of dollars to various causes.\n\nHer net worth on Friday stood at $42.6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n(Reporting by Shubhendu Deshmukh in Bengaluru; Editing by William Mallard)",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Reusable Water Bottles on Amazon Under $50.\n\nStanley Cups: The Latest Social Media Sensation\n\nThe Stanley fever has taken TikTok and Instagram by storm. There are over 1.73 million posts each for the hashtag #Stanley and #stanleycup on Instagram, as of January 26.

The hashtag #StanleyCup has more than 7.2 billion views on social media across the globe. The brand is also expected to report $750 million in sales in 2023, $70 million more than in 2020. As per the report, the success of the brand is heavily attributed to its marketing capabilities.\n\nWhile popularity may be good news for the brand, not all fame has positive outcomes. The fever has coerced people into committing crimes and unethical activities. For instance, a man was witnessed jumping across the Starbucks counter to get his hands on the limited edition pink cup.

        "title": "3 Key Quarterly Releases to Watch Next Week",
        "content": "Earnings season continues to chug along, with various companies reporting quarterly results daily. The period is undoubtedly an exciting time for investors, as companies finally pull the curtain back and unveil what’s transpired throughout the period.\n\nThis upcoming week, we have several notable names on the reporting docket, a list that includes several mega-cap tech favorites such as Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL.\n\nIt raises a valid question – what are analysts expecting out of each? Let’s take a closer dive into quarterly expectations.\n\nApple\n\nPerhaps the most beloved of the bunch, market leader Apple will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.\n\nShares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year. Revenue expectations have been slightly more negative, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOf course, investors will be focused on the company’s iPhone sales, but Apple’s services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. For the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion.\n\nApple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late, as we can see below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon, the e-commerce and cloud computing titan, will report on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has posted strong quarterly results as of late, exceeding our consensus EPS expectations by an average of 55% over its last four releases.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike AAPL, Amazon shares moved well higher post-earnings following its latest release, with shares continuing their momentum throughout 2024 so far. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been notably bullish for the release, as the $0.81 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has been taken nearly 7% higher since November and reflects growth of a sizable 280% year-over-year. Top line expectations have primarily remained flat. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning Amazon, AWS will likely be yet again a big focus among investors. For the release, the Zacks Consensus estimate for AWS sales stands at $24.3 billion, reflecting solid growth from the year-ago mark of $21.4 billion.\n\nThe market titan modestly fell short of consensus AWS net sales expectations in its latest report. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nLike those above, Meta Platforms is scheduled to unveil its quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has crushed earnings expectations as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates in four consecutive releases.\n\nShares faced modest pressure post-earnings following its latest release before quickly rebounding and melting higher. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been bullish on tech’s outlook, and Meta certainly hasn’t been an exception, with the $4.81 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up 2% since last November and indicating growth of 60%. Top line revisions have moved similarly, as the $38.9 billion consensus sales estimate has climbed 1% over the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company generates the bulk of its revenues through advertising, a metric that META has consistently positively surprised on as of late. For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus estimate for advertising net sales stands at $37.8 billion, showing considerable growth from last year’s $31.3 billion print. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is upon us, with a wide variety of companies unveiling quarterly results daily.\n\nNext week, we’ll hear from several mega-cap tech players, including Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, and Meta Platforms META.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Magnificent 7 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks looks at where the market stands after the early wave of big tech earnings reports from the likes of Tesla and Netflix. The episode then explores why investors might want to buy three of the Magnificent 7 technology stocks—Meta, Apple, and Amazon—with their quarterly earnings results due out on February 1.\n\nThe S&P 500 is trading near its new all-time highs heading into the most highly-anticipated week of corporate earnings that features reports from Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and other giants.\n\nNetflix, United Rentals, and American Airlines all surged following their financial releases, highlighting the ongoing strength of U.S. consumers and the wider economy.\n\nTesla was one of the standout underperformers thus far. But Wall Street might start to nibble at the EV giant sooner than later considering the oversold levels it is trading at.\n\nThere is no telling how Wall Street will react to the wave of Magnificent 7 reports next week. On top of that, there is little doubt that these big tech names and the broader market will face selling pressure and pull back down to key moving averages at some point again because that is always the case even in strong bull markets.\n\nBut the last several years have showcased how tricky the market timing game can be and why investors might want to adopt buy-and-hold mentalities. On top of that, owning some of these mega-cap tech giants is likely savvy investing even if it seems far too easy.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (META) shares are trading at new all-time highs ahead of its Q4 earnings release on February 1, skyrocketing 160% in the last year. Yet, Meta trades at a 16% discount to the Zacks tech sector, 10% below its 10-year median, and nearly 70% below its highs at 22.1X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nThe stock might be a little overheated, but it is still trading above all of its key short-term and longer-term moving averages. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nThe parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp grew its daily active user (people) base by 7% last quarter to 3.14 billion, while its monthly active users popped 7% to 3.96 billion, reaching half of the global population.\n\nMeta’s various apps serve different pockets of social media and digital communication, and the firm stands to benefit from ongoing ad spending in a world of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing in its AI future and it could still be a long-term winner if the metaverse dream becomes a reality.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the here and now, Meta is poised to churn out profits as it focuses on steady expansion and efficiency. Meta is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 46% in FY23 and another 23% in FY24 on the back of 15% and 14%, respective revenue growth. Meta’s positive earnings revisions activity helps it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is focused on efficiency and profitability these days and is set to report on February 1. AMZN is attempting to improve AWS cloud computing margins by rolling out more in-house chips, while also working with Nvidia.\n\nOn the e-commerce front, Amazon is boosting profitability through a different fulfillment network structure. AMZN is also growing its digital advertising unit and attempting to attract more Prime subscribers via different streaming offerings and other perks.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon’s earnings outlook has improved to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for the company to grow its adjusted earnings by 280% in FY23 from $0.71 per share to $2.70 and then expand another 36% in FY24. Meanwhile, AMZN is poised to grow its revenue by 11% and 12%, respectively during this stretch to climb from $514 billion last year to $637 billion in 2024. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon stock has soared 785% in the last decade to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 280%. Despite this run, Amazon is down 2% in the last three years vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 27% climb and it trades around 15% below its all-time highs.\n\nAmazon’s forward earnings multiple remains rather high. But its focus on bottom-line growth has it looking lightyears better than it was. Amazon’s PEG ratio might also suggest its P/E ratio will continue to come down.\n\nApple (AAPL), like all of the stocks on the list today doesn’t need an introduction and it reports earnings (Q1 FY24) on February 1.\n\nAAPL stock closed out 2023 on a downbeat note after hitting all-time highs as Wall Street worried about slowing growth in China, a saturated high-end smartphone market, possible legal setbacks, and more. Apple’s revenue did fall by 2.8% last year, but that is rather common given its somewhat cyclical iPhone-heavy business. And the stock is already bouncing back. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEven in a 'down year' Apple sold $200 billion worth of iPhones in FY23 vs. $142 billion in FY19. Plus, CEO Tim Cook has helped turn its iPhones, Macs, and more, which have amassed an installed base of “over 2 billion active devices,” into a separate growth engine via services-focused subscriptions.\n\nThe biggest growth segment at the company includes the App Store, streaming TV, and more.

        "title": "Earnings Countdown: Mega-Cap Stocks Take the Stage Next Week",
        "content": "Although next week will not be the most numerous in earnings reports, it will be the most important. Five of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks will be reporting and the two largest American energy companies – sharing with investors some of the most valuable economic data in the world.\n\nThus far, the earnings season has been generally upbeat with the majority of stocks reporting thus far beating both earnings and revenue estimates.\n\nTechnology\n\nFrom the Zacks Earnings Trend Report from research head Sheraz Mian, he notes that:\n\n“For the Technology sector, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +18.7% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues. Had it not been for the strong Tech sector contribution, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index would be down -5.9% (instead of up +0.6% as a whole).\r\n\r\nThe ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ - Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) - will start reporting Q4 results in the next few days. Total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +38.3% from the same period last year on +12.5% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +54.2% higher earnings on +12.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q3.”\n\nWhich is quite incredible when you think about it. We have many analysts and commentators commenting on how large a portion of the S&P 500 the mega-cap tech stocks have become, but the sales and earnings growth they put up is simply undeniable.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the market closes, we will get earnings from Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL, and then on Thursday Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta Platforms META.\n\nI also want to note the valuations on the five tech stocks reporting next week. Although there is much talk of “its only the mag 7 dragging the market higher,” none of them have absurd valuations, and a couple are quite appealing.\n\nWe can see that Amazon and Microsoft have the loftiest forward earnings multiples, while Meta Platforms and Alphabet have the lowest and Apple is right in the middle. Both Meta Platforms and Alphabet are trading below their five-year median valuations of 23.3x and 24.2x respectively and are forecasting EPS to grow 21% and 17% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Microsoft and Apple are trading above their five-year median valuations of 31x and 26x respectively. These are obviously historical premiums, but not excessively high. Microsoft is anticipating annual EPS growth of 15.5% over the next 3-5 years and Apple 12.7%.\n\nAnd finally, Amazon, with the most premium valuation is actually the farthest below its five-year median of 72.5x. Admittedly, Amazon’s valuation has always been a bit of a conundrum, because the e-commerce business runs with such low margins, but these days it is balanced by Amazon Web services, which is the largest cloud-service provider. AMZN is projecting annual EPS growth of 28.5% over the next 3-5 years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nI think that this data can yield a fairly simple conclusion; based on valuations Meta Platforms and Alphabet are quite appealing, while Microsoft and Apple may have to work off their premium multiples before they are as attractive. Amazon looks appealing as well based on its very high earnings growth expectations.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Apple and Alphabet have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.\n\nEnergy\n\nRegarding earnings expectations, energy stocks are on the completely other side of the spectrum from Technology. From the Earnings Trend Report:\n\n“Sectors expected to experience the biggest earnings declines in Q4 include Autos, Basic Materials, Medical, Energy, and Transportation.”\n\nEnergy stocks have struggled over the last year primarily due to the easing of Oil prices. Following the start of Ukraine-Russia war, and easing of inflation, the price of crude oil has steadily fallen from the $130 highs to $78 today, with intermittent spikes up to $95.\n\nThis reflects the cyclical nature of investing in oil stocks and doesn’t come as to big a surprise. But even with expectations of falling YoY earnings, I think this sector is still rather appealing, and worth considering as investments.\n\nOn Friday, US oil majors Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron CVX report earnings before the market opens.\n\nLike the technology stocks, when looking at energy from a historical valuation perspective it is hard to deny the attractiveness. Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron are trading at very reasonable valuations of ~10x forward earnings, easing considerably from the three-year highs near 30x. But they are also below the 10-year medians, which both stand at ~17.7x.\n\nChevron and Exxon Mobil also both pay hefty dividends of 4% and 3.7% respectively and have structural tailwinds. The structural tailwinds are namely a broad underinvestment in oil and gas infrastructure, which is likely to keep oil supply low for the coming years.\n\nBoth Exxon Mobil and Chevron have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe energy and technology sectors offer two very different outlooks regarding earnings, yet both may be appealing based on valuations. Because they are such critical and leading industries in the country, discerning investors would be wise to hold some mix of the stocks shared.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) hold the highest cash and short-term investment balances among nonbanking companies in the S&P 500 community. Although they are not hurting cash-wise, they are also quite careful about their spending.\n\nAmazon and Google-parent Alphabet entered the new year by announcing more layoffs. Last year, Amazon, Google, along with Microsoft, Meta and Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM), trimmed their respective workforces by 6% to 13%, but layoffs started back in 2022, costing several thousand employees their jobs.\n\nNew Round Of Layoffs Suggests Big Tech Bit Off More It Can Chew\n\nLast week, Google announced its job cuts across engineering and hardware teams as it continues its push for greater efficiency. Although other parts of the tech giant were affected, mostly impacted were workers in hardware, central engineering and Google Assistant voice-activated software product. As it continues to keep up with its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon, Google eliminated about 12,000 jobs last year under the leadership of Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud titan, Amazon laid off hundreds across Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios divisions, taking the overall job cuts to 27,000. Last year alone, Amazon laid off about 18,000 employees.\n\nCutting Jobs To Fund AI Efforts\n\nAlthough it seems like a strange time for job cuts considering that Big Tech ended 2023 by exiting the post-pandemic slump with the recovery of online advertising, Big Tech is in an expensive arms race to build AI services. Therefore, it is not a surprise that Google and Amazon opted to continue the trend of cost-cutting efforts, while streamlining operations and focusing on key projects. But even though this year will bring increased AI spending, its impact on revenue will likely be limited. Although generative AI is expected to pay out big-time, but turning GenAI magic into the desired top and bottom-line business impact will take time. Microsoft gained the early lead in the AI-race thanks to its partnership with the ChatGPT creator, OpenAI, but Amazon and Google are determined to catch up and to do so, they will need to spend their billions wisely.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "The next act in Amazon’s video business",
        "content": "Hi friends. This is Jason Del Rey, Fortune’s new tech correspondent.\n\nI’ve spent much of the past decade reporting on Amazon and its successes, failures, opportunities, and flaws—both at the online tech publication Recode (RIP) as well as in my new book, Winner Sells All.\n\nEven so, at various points over that time, I’ve struggled to understand the rationale behind some of the company’s big bets. One of those has been Amazon’s ambitious, and incredibly expensive, investments aimed at becoming a major player in the TV and movie streaming business.\n\nWhen Amazon first introduced Prime Video in 2011, the content library was so uninspiring that Jeff Bezos decided to give it away as part of the Prime shipping program.\n\n“I remember Jeff used those exact words—it’s an ‘Oh, by the way,’ former Amazon video executive Bill Carr told me years ago. “‘Yeah, Prime is $79 a year. Oh, by the way, there’s free movies and TV shows with it.’ And how much could consumers complain about the quality of movies and TV shows if it’s free?”\n\nBut over time, Amazon has become one of the most aggressive spenders in the entertainment industry, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. While company executives have long argued that Prime’s video business helps the company’s retail engine sell more stuff, Amazon’s own employees have sometimes had their doubts.\n\nAs the tech journalist Brad Stone wrote in his 2021 book Amazon Unbound, Amazon video employees he spoke to found “little evidence of a connection between viewing and purchasing behavior—especially one that justified the enormous outlay on video.”\n\nThe truth, Stone wrote, was that Amazon was making TV shows and films because “Bezos wanted Amazon to make TV shows and films.”\n\nSo what would happen after Bezos announced in February 2021 that he was handing over the CEO role to the longtime head of AWS, Andy Jassy? Well, the video bets kept coming. Shortly after Bezos announced his successor, Amazon announced that it had acquired the rights to Thursday Night Football, in a deal running through 2032 that is reportedly costing around $1 billion per year. A year later, the tech giant acquired MGM for $8.5 billion in its second-largest acquisition ever.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there are also signs that Amazon’s video initiatives under Jassy may come with a bit more attention paid to the bottom line. Earlier this month, Amazon cut hundreds of corporate jobs across its streaming and studio businesses. And in a major change, Amazon Prime Video movies and TV shows will begin including ads on Jan. 29 unless customers pay an extra $2.99 a month for an ad-free tier.\n\nAt the same time, the company is also making moves to acquire the rights to more live sports, agreeing to invest more than $100 million in a regional sports network that could give the tech giant streaming rights to more than three dozen teams across Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, and the National Basketball Association. Live sports are an area of the video business sources say Jassy is especially keen on and one that the company hopes will attract more lucrative TV ad dollars as it’s one of the last bastions of appointment viewing. Amazon’s $40 billion ad business is already one of the most profitable segments of the company.\n\nSo it shouldn’t be a surprise that when Fortune CEO Alan Murray asked Jassy in a recent interview to name the company initiatives he’s most excited about, the Amazon CEO started with this one:\n\n“I’m very bullish on what we’re doing with Prime Video.”\n\nNext week, Amazon announces its financial results for the holiday quarter, and a lot of attention will be aimed at the tech giant’s core retail business and what executives say about the current behavior of the average American consumer. But I’ll also be very curious to watch for any signs of where Jassy and Amazon are taking this very expensive, onetime side hobby, next.\n\nJason Del Rey\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

He is a Jefferies senior analyst. Brent, as always, great to get your insight, especially ahead of such a big week here for the tech sector. Heading in to next week, what's the top question you have for some of these tech giants?\n\nBRENT THILL: Demand environments, number one. AI hype is number two. There's a huge hype cycle we're in. And Kennedy's companies deliver on AI. And then I think just sustainability of demand. You've seen tech stocks go straight up. And I think everyone's concern is, is there a little bit of a bubble in terms of overall movement in some of these names? So can the demand hang in on the back side of this?\n\nSo I think those are some big ones at this point. I think that the biggest driver right now is the AI bubble that we're in. Certainly, we believe in it. But as they say, everyone may be overestimating the near term and underestimating the long term. So I think that's probably the biggest concern, especially for Microsoft, which has been running with all these Copilot AI excitement. Certainly, Amazon. Can they catch up to Microsoft is another big topic in AI. They've dropped back. We think that they can throughout the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd then I'd say, for Meta, the biggest thing we're watching is just overall advertising demand has been really coming back. We went from a hard landing to the economy to a potential softer landing. And that softer landing is good for advertising. All the Meta checks have been phenomenal. And we've continued to hear great things.\n\nI'd say the last thing we're watching is really these job cuts. And I think everyone in tech that we're talking to is saying that there are more cuts coming. I think many thought these cuts were done. But I do believe there's a lot of excess waste still in the tech ecosystem. And you're going to see probably more job cuts than maybe we would expect. And that goes back to not that demand is bad. But I think that these companies realize that they can do more with less. And that's a good thing to restoring the bottom line health to technology.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Brent, I want to come back to something that you just mentioned a moment ago in that we could see this bubble burst potentially at some point in the AI hype. And then, ultimately, the show me story that's started to really formulate at this point. Is there one company that you believe is on watch at this point, if that AI bubble does burst?\n\nBRENT THILL: Well, I think you have to look at the companies where there's the most euphoria around AI. And that's definitely Microsoft, Adobe. And there's a handful of others. Salesforce is probably not as euphoric on AI. But those are the companies. And we think that Adobe and Microsoft are in phenomenal positions. The question is-- again, and this happened last year with Microsoft, which is they come out. They show these demos. But then when you talk to the customers in the field, they're like, well, it's not quite as good as they demoed. And the adoption is not quite as fast.\n\nAnd so look, Microsoft's been guiding to this. They've said, front half of the fiscal year, which just ended, no revenue. Back half of this fiscal year, which ends in June, coming up is one of the revenue comes. So we're now expecting this revenue ramp. What kind of details are they going to give us? What kind of color? How are those deployments going to go?\n\nAll of this is talk. The implementation in the field of customers taking it starts to happen now. And I think this is where all the top execs that we know that have been in software for two plus dec-- three decades, four decades, in some cases, they're like, everyone's becoming a little skeptical.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Five of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech megacaps will report earnings next week, with artificial-intelligence investment, regulatory challenges and waning China demand among the shared themes in focus.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGiuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy US Fires on Houthi Missile Hours After Trafigura Ship Attack MacKenzie Scott Pares Her Amazon Stake by $10 Billion Gas-Addicted Europe Trades One Energy Risk for Another Putin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Seeing War Advantage\n\nAlong with Microsoft Corp., which just hit a historic $3 trillion market valuation, Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are set to post record revenues for the quarter, underscoring the strength of the US economy. Even so, they are likely to be asked about further cost reductions after the significant job cuts they have each embarked on in recent weeks.\n\nApple Inc., grappling with slowing China sales, antitrust accusations and bruised from a patent fight, could give investors a better sense of early demand for its new Vision Pro, which some big-name developers are steering clear of. Boeing Co., mired deep in a safety crisis that prompted the US Federal Aviation Administration to freeze a planned production increase of 737 Max, will face more questions about how it plans to allay concerns over the quality of its aircraft.\n\nMonday: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday: Microsoft (MSFT US) is set to post a 16% jump to record quarterly sales, with TD Cowen seeing strength in its Azure segment from returning cloud customers and rising AI demand. The monetization of its AI-powered virtual assistant Copilot will be scrutinized though the product won’t make significant topline contributions until later this year, Evercore said.\n\nAlphabet’s (GOOGL US) earnings per share is seen rising 52%, with Jefferies pointing to ad revenue growth in the year-end quarter and the ramping up of NFL Sunday Ticket channel on YouTube as driving forces. Its Google Cloud segment should see “measured and gradual” growth as customers prepare for AI deployments, Jefferies added. Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD US) AI exposure will help drive sales 9.5% higher, in contrast to Qualcomm (QCOM US), which is seen revealing a stagnant topline when it reports Wednesday despite a rebound in its handset and automotive segments. Starbucks’ (SBUX US) North American same-store sales growth is projected to about halve to 5.8% from the same period a year ago. Domestic sales were volatile in November and December amid union walkouts and social-media calls to boycott the coffee chain over its perceived response to the Israel-Hamas war, William Blair noted. General Motors (GM US) deliveries were flat in the quarter as strikes cut output at four plants that make the automaker’s top-selling models. Despite the dropoff — deliveries were up 41% the same period a year ago — profit could still beat expectations as US production likely outpaced sales to account for lost output during the strike, Bloomberg Intelligence said. UPS (UPS US) adjusted earnings per share will slide by double-digits for the fourth quarter in a row, weighed down by higher costs from its new labor contract and tepid shipping growth. Investors will want to gauge the firm’s progress on winning back market share lost during fraught labor talks and hear about the impact of Red Sea shipping disruptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday: Boeing (BA US) will see operating profit of $287 million, snapping a five-quarter streak of losses on more commercial-aircraft deliveries and strong services demand. With its growth ambitions dented by the US Federal Aviation Administration’s move to freeze planned production increases for the 737 Max aircraft, executives are set to face intense scrutiny on the company’s next steps.\n\nMastercard (MA US) should be able to raise earnings per share by 16% for the quarter as cuts to expenses offset slowing revenue growth and increased buybacks. Company guidance for 2024 should be in line with consensus, Baird said.\n\nThursday: Apple (AAPL US) may score a modest beat on earnings estimates despite slowing sales in China, Evercore said, noting that a patent dispute involving its smartwatches should have little impact. Initial signs point to strong demand for the Vision Pro headset which, along with AI-driven features on its iPhones, could drive growth this year, Bank of America said. Investors will want more color on its overhaul of its App Store and iPhone features in the European Union to appease regulators..\n\nMeta’s (META US) 2023 ad revenue growth was fueled by Chinese e-commerce platforms but whether the Facebook parent can rely on the likes of Shein and Temu this year remains to be seen, given simmering China-US tensions, BI said. Meta may also need to focus investments in its large-language model to improve ad targeting amid declining user engagement. Amazon (AMZN US) may beat expectations for a low-double-digit revenue gain — consensus calls for 11% — given a stronger-than-expected holiday season and sequentially improving sales at Amazon Web Services, BI said. The addition of ads to its Prime video service, along with its cloud order book and insights on consumer shopping trends, will be in focus.\n\nFriday: Exxon Mobil (XOM US) has warned of a $2.5 billion writedown in some of its California operations in guidance released this month. Gas trading and downstream-derivative tailwinds shored up its profits, TD Cowen said, though consensus estimates point to a 35% fall in earnings per share. Lower oil prices have also dragged Chevron’s (CVX US) profits lower as earnings per share is seen retreating 21% with an LNG pricing uptick failing to offset lower refining margins.\n\nCharter Communications (CHTR US) investors may focus on broadband subscriber numbers after its fight with Walt Disney over fees left its pay-TV customers temporarily unable to view channels backed by the entertainment giant. Broadband revenue could still get a boost from better average revenue per user gains with the end of promotional discounts, BI said. Cigna’s (CI US) earnings per share likely jumped 32%, more than double the previous quarter’s rate, amid a rise in medical customers and a largely stable medical loss ratio. Medical costs, forecast 14% higher in the quarter, is a concern, especially after health insurance peer Humana’s recent move to cut its forecast on higher-than-anticipated expenses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?

        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.3% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AMZN\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Amazon, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AMZN Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.6% over the past month to $2.70.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This, in turn, is expected to bolster the Google Services segment, which has been the key growth catalyst for Alphabet.\n\nExpanding Generative AI-Backed Offering\n\nApart from the latest generative AI additions to Chrome, Google's Art Selfie 2 uses generative AI to match users' faces with existing artworks, allowing them to find doppelgangers.\r\n\r\nFurther, Art Selfie 2 uses generative AI to create a stylized image of users’ faces, blending your selfie into a chosen scenario, allowing hair, head coverings, jewelry and clothing to be replaced.\r\n\r\nAlphabet also introduced an AI support assistant, which allows users to expand and ask questions, with the option to leave a thumb-up or down, view answer sources and suggest follow-up questions, enhancing its generative AI capabilities for virtual assistance.\r\n\r\nThe company is also set to introduce a generative AI-powered “Help me write” feature to Chrome for Desktop use. This new AI feature can adjust its writing style, including \"Shorten\" or \"Elaborate\" options, as well as \"Casual\" or \"Formal\" options, with fewer options than Docs or Messages.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing endeavors to infuse generative AI capabilities into its product offerings will result in an enhanced user experience, allowing Alphabet to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the generative AI market space.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market is expected to reach $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects in the promising gen AI market is expected to benefit Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntensifying Competition\n\nThe latest move is likely to aid Alphabet in strengthening its competitive position against peers like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META, which are also making continuous efforts to capitalize on the growth opportunities present in the booming generative AI market.\r\n\r\nNotably, Microsoft’s OpenAI introduced the GPT Store to create a marketplace for specialized chatbot agents based on their language models, particularly ChatGPT, allowing users to create unique agents for various purposes like salary negotiation and recipe development.\r\n\r\nFurther, Microsoft plans to offer users the ability to customize Copilot, a generative AI assistant, with customized versions called Copilot GPTs. These GPTs will be tailored for specific purposes like fitness, travel, or business.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Amazon announced generative AI capabilities for its virtual assistant Alexa, optimizing voice interactions, real-time information, smart home control and entertainment.\r\n\r\nAmazon also unveiled Titan Image Generator, a generative AI model that can create new or customize existing images, currently available in preview on Bedrock's AI development platform. This image generator tool uses English natural language prompts to create realistic images for advertising, e-commerce and media.\r\n\r\nMeta, on the other hand, unveiled Meta AI, an advanced conversational assistant for WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3, providing real-time information and photorealistic images.\r\n\r\nMeta AI uses Meta’s state-of-the-art foundational language model, Llama 2, for text-based chats, accessing real-time information through Bing's search partnership and offering image generation tools.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +285.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.70 points to a change of +280.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.66 indicates a change of +35.5% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $166.23 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $571.07 billion and $636.74 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.1% and +11.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.6%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.20 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $141.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.1%. The EPS surprise was +46.55%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is implementing layoffs of close to 700 employees, about 1% of its 70,000-strong workforce, following a previous reduction of 10% or around 8,000 workers in 2023.\n\nThis move comes amid ongoing cost-cutting pressures from investors, including activist shareholders like Elliott Management, to drive its margins.\n\nDespite these cuts, Salesforce still maintains 1,000 open positions, suggesting these layoffs are part of workforce adjustments rather than a significant strategic shift, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe company’s focus is on directing spending towards growth.\n\nLast September, Salesforce also shared plans to hire nearly 3,300 new employees across various departments, focusing significantly on sales, engineering, and developing the company’s data cloud product.\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft’s Bing Sees Modest Growth with ChatGPT Integration, But Google Still Leads the Search Market\n\nThese steps have contributed to a significant boost in its stock value, which increased by almost 80% over the last 12 months, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 37% rise.\n\nTech firms increasingly focus on artificial intelligence (AI), leading to a hiring surge in this area while other sectors face layoffs into 2024.

        "title": "Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks",
        "content": "In the last 10 years, Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) has experienced an annual average price return of around 19%, with a median dividend yield of 1.43%. That puts the total investment return at around 20% as an annual average over that period. I expect these returns are quite likely to continue, especially considering favorable future revenue estimates. The largest fundamental risk for the company seems to be its balance sheet.\n\n2024 operations updates\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nOn Jan. 16, Oracle released its first quarterly Critical Patch Update, or CPU, of the year. It addressed an important set of vulnerabilities across its product families. Around 389 new security patches are included, which target 191 common vulnerabilities and exposures, or CVEs. Thirty-seven of the patches are considered critical, focusing on fixing severe security risks.\n\nThe company's Financial Services Applications received 71 new security patches. Oracle Communications received 55 patches and Oracle Fusion Middleware received 40 patches. The CPU also addresses potential security weaknesses in MySQL, Java SE and the E-Business Suite.\n\nThese updates are crucial at a time when advanced technology companies like Oracle are expanding and adapting toward artificial intelligence and facing a range of threats from criminal organizations that are also utilizing such technologies. The updates should maintain the company's market position and keep clients' trust after a difficult period of heightened cybercrime. By 2025, worldwide cybercrime costs are estimated to reach a staggering $10.5 trillion annually, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.\n\nThe company's investments in advanced technology seem to be paying off, driving revenue growth and positioning it well in the cloud services industry. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Oracle reported a year-over-year total revenue increase of 9%. In the second quarter, it reported a year-over-year total revenue increase of 5%. The growth in the second quarter was largely driven by a 25% surge in cloud revenue, both IaaS and SaaS. The company has also been aggressively expanding into cloud data centers. Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison has noted that this reflects Oracle's commitment to high demand for cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial analysis\n\nOracle has particularly strong earnings growth as opposed to revenue growth historically. The chart below shows around a decade of plateaued revenue growth, which has now begun to increase. The second chart shows reliable earnings per share without non-recurring items growth over the last decade, albeit with periods of volatility. Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks\n\nBecause the company has focused on high-margin products, including databases and enterprise software, this can support earnings growth even when revenue increases are lacking. Oracle's continued shift toward cloud computing services is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the future. The recurring revenue model associated with cloud services leads to steady and predictable revenue streams that could contribute to maintaining around 20% annual total investment returns for shareholders over the next decade.\n\nOracle has a high net margin compared to its industry peers. At 19.64%, the major competitors that beat it on this metric are Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) at 27.97%, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) at 21.05% and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) at 22.25%. However, this should not undermine the company's strength in this area, as its net margin is ranked better than 90.93% of companies in the software industry, according to GuruFocus.\n\nTo help drive net margin growth, the company has been focusing on artificial intelligence, specifically through its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or OCI. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other leaders in the field have endorsed OCI's GPU clusters for AI infrastructure, reflecting strength in the area. In addition, Oracle is forming partnerships to focus on private and secure AI cloud services, which should further drive top-line growth and, more significantly, make it more efficient, creating further opportunities for net margin expansion.\n\nOracle has a strong record of repurchasing stock, doing so every single year on record since 2008. While its repurchasing rates have varied from under $1 billion in 2010 to $36.64 billion in 2019, the continuous effect of such financial management is highly beneficial for shareholders who are interested in price returns from the stock as opposed to dividends.\n\nValuation\n\nOracle does seem highly valued at the moment. Even with the GF Value line showing it to be fairly valued, I think the stock's valuation is a risk that investors need to consider. Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks\n\nIt has a price-earnings ratio of around 30.50 and a forward price-earnings ratio of around 20, which is more or less average for the industry it is in. However, if there is any slowdown in growth due to regulatory pressures surrounding its cloud infrastructure and AI services, the stock could see unwarranted volatility. This is true insofar as these regulatory risks are not already priced in. My perspective is they are not fully accounted for, leading to a potential slight overvaluation in the stock at present.\n\nTo get some perspective on the company's price-earnings ratio relative to its major industry peers, Adobe has a forward ratio of around 34, Synopsys of around 37 and Fortinet of around 37.\n\nBalance sheet and competitive risks\n\nOracle's balance sheet is one of the largest risks for the stock as its total liabilities have risen from 43.71% of assets in 2012 to 96.74% in the last trailing 12 months. Around 61.39% of assets are balanced by long-term debt right now, and the company issues debt on a regular basis, with only two years of no issuance since 2015. However, its cash flow from financing is usually negative due to the regular repurchase of common stock. I think this shows a financial management team far more focused on growth than the balance sheet; my only concern with this strategy is that too far an overextension could result in more moderate growth long term as a matter of equilibrium. The company might find itself needing to divert its resources to servicing debt, leaving less available for growth strategies and shareholder returns. During a severe economic crisis, the company's current level of debt would make it less agile to deal with the challenges.\n\nThe company is also going to face significant competition in cloud infrastructure, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Compute Engine. These companies have IaaS offerings and cloud solutions like private servers, bare metal servers and cloud-based object storage services. AWS is known for its extensive range of options, like EC2 and CloudFormation, providing security and tailorable compute capacity and resource management. Microsoft Azure has a global network of data centers and strong scaling capacity, while Google Compute Engine has notable security benefits and elastic load balancing.\n\nThe competition in these areas is fierce, and whether Oracle will be a dominant player is yet to be seen in many respects. It remains positioned for continued growth, but like all of the major organizations working in artificial intelligence and cloud solutions, specific niches are integral to maintaining market share.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Oracle is a buy for me. Whether the company's annual stock returns will average at around 20% over the next decade is speculative, but the company is positioned operationally to have strong performance ahead. However, the balance sheet and competition risks, in particular, make me skeptical about allocating a large amount to the investment. I feel less confident investing in Oracle than I do in Microsoft and Google, yet the stock remains on my watchlist for when I next allocate to the technology section of my portfolio.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Rivian Automotive: A Growth Stock Without Growth",
        "content": "Since its initial public offering, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has been priced like a growth stock. But it shouldn't be. The futuristic design, the made in the USA appeal and the backing from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are the main arguments in favor of the business case. But in reality, larger, faster-growing and more efficient competitors keep eating Rivian's market share and the company continues to disappoint in deliveries, economies of scale and stock performance.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with RIVN.\n\nThis is my case on why I think the stock is still overvalued despite a 90% drop from its all-time high and an 80% drop from its IPO price.\n\nBusiness and stock overview\n\nRivian Automotive designs, develops, manufactures and sells electric vehicles. It started trading in the stock market in November 2021 at $78 per share, valuing it at around $66.5 billion, 30% more than General Motors' (GM) current market cap and 20% more than BYD's (SZSE:002594) current total enterprise value. The company attracted millions of investors worldwide with its futuristic brand, at the time being described as the new Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and was backed by Amazon.\n\nThe EV manufacturer raised close to $12 billion with the IPO and less than two years later, the company had to issue in October a convertible bond round for $ 1.5 billion, indicating it is running out of cash. The stock is valued like a growth stock, but the business growth is insufficient to justify its stock price. Rivian Automotive: A Growth Stock Without Growth\n\nRIVN Data by GuruFocus\n\nA growth stock that is not growing\n\nTwo key metrics to follow for any automotive company are production and deliveries. They are the base of business performance and growth. And they have been relatively disappointing for Rivian in relation to what you would expect of a growth stock and the valuation at which it currently stands. The following chart may look rosy at first, but it is not. Rivian Automotive: A Growth Stock Without Growth\n\nIndeed, in the last quarter, deliveries have declined by 10% and were below estimates. It delivered 13,972 vehicles in the last three months of 2023, below estimates of 14,430. This is the second quarter in its young history that the company saw a decline in deliveries: the only other time was in the first quarter of 2023. Two quarters of a relative decline in the same year could show the growth is perhaps not as solid as many expected. The existing investors may assume it is a coincidence and the overall deliveries and production have increased over time when zooming out - the question is at what cost?\n\nStory continues\n\nInterest rates, monetary policy nor supply chains are reason enough to explain the decline. The real cause of the decline in deliveries is competition. Rivian Automotive: A Growth Stock Without Growth\n\nBoth Tesla and BYD registered quarter-over-quarter increases in the fourth quarter, with the latter taking over Tesla. This comes at a time when both companies are facing some challenging external factors when it comes to production and shipping. Both Tesla and BYD have production centers in China and shipping from there, while Rivian produces on U.S. soil. Manufacturing in the U.S. seems to be an advantage for shortened production and deliveries, but investors are quickly realizing that producing in the U.S. has become much more expensive in the last two years. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reported that Rivian has spent about half of its $18 billion cash pile and lost about $33,000 on each truck it sold in the second quarter.\n\nIndeed, while revenue increased, the cost of goods sold also increased significantly, aggravating the net income and burning cash faster. Rivian Automotive: A Growth Stock Without Growth\n\nRIVN Data by GuruFocus\n\nThe situation has worsened to the point that Rivian had to issue a new round of bonds earlier than expected, with a $1.5 billion bond issuance in October causing a 20% crash in the share price on the day of the announcement. Indeed, the notes are convertible, meaning existing investors could see themselves diluted further after an over 80% drop in the share price since its IPO.\n\nOn the ratios side, the picture is just as bleak. The returns on assets and on equity, two favoured metrics of a seasoned investor, are not improving. Rivian Automotive: A Growth Stock Without Growth\n\nThe company is not on track to becoming more efficient. It needs to spend at least as much money to generate revenue, and this is not an indicator of intrinsic growth. The fundamentals of the business are not improving.\n\nLastly, the valuation is also hard to sustain over time without real intrinsic growth and improved efficiency of the business. Based on the valuation metrics available, the overvaluation of Rivian in relation to the EV sector median rates the stock at a D and D+. Trailing and forward enterprise value as a multiple of sales are 2 to 2.50 times higher than the sector median. Rivian Automotive: A Growth Stock Without Growth\n\nBased on the fundamentals, lack of intrinsic growth and more efficient competitors with better prospects, the fair value of the stock should be below the median of the sector. With a more conservative approach, one could value the stock at sector median and therefore, the fair value should not exceed $10. I rate it, therefore, as a sell.\n\nWhat could invalidate my sell case\n\nMy sell case could be invalidated by a rapid scale up in operations. A number of new corporate partnerships, after the exclusivity with Amazon was terminated in early November, similar to the already announced AT&T partnership, could further boost sales. The boost in sales could help Rivian to scale up its operations and considerably reduce its costs per vehicle produced. Interest rate cuts and government subsidies to the EV company could further help to increase its sales and reduce costs, but the main factor would be a rapid scale up of operations to reduce the cost per sold vehicle.\n\nBottom line\n\nRivian's stock is currently still valued as a high-growth stock, albeit down 90% from its all-time high and 80% from its IPO price. The absence of intrinsic growth leading the company to spend at least as much more as it receives in return is a negative prospect for sustained growth. Without quickly closing on new partnerships and sustainably boosting deliveries, therefore scaling up its operations as soon as possible, it is likely that existing investors will continue suffering from lower stock prices, stronger competition and further dilution with possibly new (convertible) bond issuances. For these reasons, I do not believe the stock is an attractive buying opportunity.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Nasdaq Surges in 2024",
        "content": "The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index posted a solid return of 43% in 2023. Much of this rally was fueled by the surge in AI (artificial intelligence) and related stocks. Since AI isn't a passing theme but a significant long-term technological change, this tailwind can continue to contribute positively to the Nasdaq's performance in 2024.\n\nHistorically, the performance of the Nasdaq index, which is comprised mainly of growth stocks, has been closely related to broader economic cycles -- with stronger performance seen in periods of stable growth and innovation. Stronger-than-expected economic growth, low unemployment, and cooling inflation have increased optimism about the U.S. economy.\n\nMany analysts now expect the U.S. economy to avoid a recession and, instead, witness some gentle slowdown in the coming months. Additionally, with the Federal Reserve expected to slash interest rates in the second half of fiscal 2024, the economy may even gear back to growth mode. All this is helping bolster investor confidence and bodes well for the performance of the Nasdaq index, especially in the latter half of 2024.\n\nThat's why now may be a good time to pick up small stakes in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- blue-chip stocks that have a strong ability to soar in tandem with the broader technology sector.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nLong known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity suite, technology titan Microsoft is now also recognized for its forte in several areas such as gaming, cybersecurity, and cloud computing. The company's $13 billion investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, enabled the company to embed AI capabilities in its core offerings. This has not only improved productivity, but also opened new revenue streams.\n\nCloud computing platform Azure emerged as one of the most notable growth drivers for Microsoft, benefiting significantly from enterprises migrating infrastructure, applications, and workloads to the cloud. Thanks to its broad geographic footprint, increased GPU capacity, and AI capabilities based on Nvidia's H100 AI chips, Azure is witnessing rapid expansion of its customer base. Plus, the launch of AI-powered digital assistant CoPilot, which is integrated into the company's software-as-a-service products such as the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, GitHub, and Outlook, can also prove to be a major long-term growth catalyst.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering its strength in diversified business segments, cutting-edge AI capabilities, and robust financials with over $140 billion cash and strong operating cash flow, Microsoft may prove to be a smart buy now.\n\nIntel\n\nA prominent semiconductor player, Intel stands to benefit dramatically from the anticipated recovery in PC (personal computer) shipments in 2024. Research firm Canalys expects increasing demand for AI-capable PCs to be a major driver of this recovery and account for nearly one of every five PC shipments in 2024.\n\nCanalys projected that AI-capable PC shipments will reach 170 million in 2024. To capitalize on this growing AI PC opportunity, Intel launched the Intel Core Ultra processor, also called Meteor Lake -- the first AI PC processor available at a scale that enables dedicated low-power computations for AI workloads.\n\nFurthermore, with businesses and organizations increasingly opting for cloud computing, data analytics, and AI, Intel is also benefiting from rising demand for server processors and other data center components and services from traditional data centers. A clear leader in the CPU market, Intel is seeing robust demand for its Xeon processors from cloud service providers for AI, security, and networking workloads.\n\nThe company has also unveiled its Gaudi3 accelerator chip aimed at accelerating AI workloads in the data center. This will be in direct competition with Nvidia's and Advanced Micro Devices' AI chips.\n\nIntel is also making rapid inroads in the automotive AI market with its new family of AI-enhanced chips and a deal to acquire Silicon Mobility, a company that specializes in chips for intelligent electric-vehicle energy management. The AI automotive market is estimated to grow from $3.6 billion in 2022 to $14.9 billion in 2030, so it can present a significant long-term revenue opportunity for Intel.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of these AI-fueled tailwinds, Intel's current share-price pullback seems to present an attractive buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon\n\nE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon grappled in the last couple of years with reduced consumer discretionary spending and declining enterprise spending. However, with recessionary and inflationary fears receding, the future of this stock seems bright. The company reported a 13% year-over-year rise in revenue to $143 billion in the third quarter (ending Sept. 30, 2023), and operating profit surged 348% year over year to $11.2 billion.\n\nAmazon accounted for a 37.6% share of the U.S. e-commerce market in 2023 and is working hard to maintain its market dominance. It's been implementing strategies to regionalize its delivery network, improve delivery speeds, optimize inventory management, and reduce overall operational expenses.\n\nThe company is also investing heavily in deploying robotics in its warehouses and in generative AI capabilities for product discovery, inventory forecasting, and optimizing last-mile delivery routes. With global retail e-commerce sales expected to grow by 9.6% to $6.9 trillion in 2024, Amazon seems positioned to benefit from this secular trend.\n\nFurthermore, AWS (Amazon Web Services), after experiencing a slowdown, showed signs of revenue stabilization in the third quarter. This cloud computing platform is seeing an uptick in new customer engagements and deal closures. Coupled with the success of Amazon Bedrock, a new AI service that enables AWS customers to create customized generative AI applications, AWS should continue to thrive in 2024.\n\nGiven the strength of its e-commerce business and stabilization trends in the cloud computing business, Amazon seems like a compelling pick in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly",
        "content": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat Is Amazon.com's Debt?\n\nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Amazon.com had US$79.7b in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$64.2b in cash leading to net debt of about US$15.5b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Amazon.com's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$145.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$158.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$64.2b in cash and US$37.7b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$202.1b.\n\nGiven Amazon.com has a humongous market capitalization of US$1.62t, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. But either way, Amazon.com has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nStory continues\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\n\nAmazon.com's net debt is only 0.21 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 39.5 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On top of that, Amazon.com grew its EBIT by 99% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amazon.com's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amazon.com recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is far more risky for companies with unreliable free cash flow, so shareholders should be hoping that the past expenditure will produce free cash flow in the future.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, Amazon.com's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But we must concede we find its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow has the opposite effect. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Amazon.com can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Amazon.com, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "55.1% of Warren Buffett's $370 Billion Stock Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett led the Berkshire Hathaway investment company to market-beating returns every year (on average) since 1965.\n\nWhen he's considering buying a stake in a company, Buffett likes to see a long track record of success, solid growth potential, and a strong management team. He especially likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, because these tools can accelerate the effects of compound growth on an investment over the long term.\n\nBuying a stock solely for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities would be out of character for Buffett (and Berkshire). But the conglomerate happens to own stakes in a number of companies that are developing aspects of the technology on top of their core businesses, and just four of them account for 55.1% of its $370 billion portfolio of publicly listed stocks. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Snowflake: 0.3% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nThough it's just a tiny piece of the portfolio, Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) was an unusual choice for Berkshire Hathaway. It purchased the stock during its initial public offering in 2020, and while Snowflake is still higher than its $120 a share IPO price, it has been below where it closed its first trading day for almost a year, it isn't turning a profit, and it doesn't pay a dividend. However, Snowflake is an innovative cloud computing enterprise with a fast-growing presence in AI.\n\nSnowflake's flagship Data Cloud product helps organizations aggregate their data onto one platform, no matter which cloud infrastructure providers they use. Its Snowpark platform is a similar innovation that helps bring software developers together to collaborate securely in one place, no matter what programming language they prefer. And the company recently launched Cortex -- a collection of AI-focused tools designed to complement those cloud services.\n\nOne such tool is Document AI, which allows businesses to extract valuable insights from unstructured data of the types commonly found in contracts or invoices. Cortex also features Snowflake Copilot, a generative AI virtual assistant capable of creating computer code from text-based prompts. That could significantly accelerate software development projects for Snowflake's cloud customers.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon: 0.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire owned Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock since 2019, well before the generative AI craze began. Buffett has often expressed regret for not buying it sooner, but Amazon is quickly becoming one of the most dominant companies in the AI industry, and the technology could drive substantial growth for it in the future.\n\nAmazon is developing AI in every segment of its business. Its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is getting the most attention from investors because it offers business customers a comprehensive portfolio of large language models to help them build AI applications. Plus, in a bid to compete with Nvidia's industry-leading hardware, Amazon has developed its own data center chips designed to process AI workloads.\n\nIt also offers generative AI tools to businesses on its e-commerce platform to help them create more engaging product images, descriptions, and ads. Plus, AI is responsible for delivering more accurate product recommendations to customers based on their search habits and purchasing patterns.\n\nAmazon could prove to be one of Berkshire's best AI bets over the long term.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 6.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nSoda and beverage giant Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) isn't a company one would normally associate with AI. But it's dabbling in the technology in a few different ways, and even appointed a global head of generative AI last year to spearhead its strategy.\n\nCoca-Cola released a drink in 2023 called Y3000 that was formulated using AI. The company collected inputs from consumers to determine their visions for the future, then had an AI use that data to predict what Coca-Cola might taste like in the year 3000. Plus, the soda giant is using AI to curate marketing campaigns. It launched \"Create Real Magic\" at Christmas time -- featuring a generative AI model powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 technology -- to allow consumers to create Christmas-themed Coca-Cola imagery.\n\nInitiatives like Y3000 and Create Real Magic are designed to engage consumers on deeper levels than traditional media-based advertising, which increases brand awareness and (theoretically) drives more sales.\n\nBerkshire owned Coca-Cola stock since 1988, and its $23.6 billion stake is the portfolio's fourth-largest holding.\n\n4. Apple: 48% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire's largest holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which also happens to be the second-most valuable company in the world (narrowly being beaten by Microsoft. Apple was founded in 1976, but most of its success has come since 2007, following the launch of its first iPhone. That led to the introduction of several billion-dollar hardware platforms, including the Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones.\n\nBut Apple's latest smartphone, the iPhone 15 Pro, set the stage for its AI-powered future. It's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads more efficiently on-device, rather than relying on sending such tasks to external data centers. That means features like autocorrect and the Siri voice assistant deliver results to users much faster, but what's coming makes the new hardware even more appealing.\n\nApple is working on its own large language models, and that effort could culminate in an AI application that is intended to compete with ChatGPT. That has the potential to change the way consumers use the iPhone, because a powerful AI assistant of that caliber would bring automation to everything from emails to messages to appointment setting. The ability to quickly create and edit images and videos would also transform the way Apple users share content with their friends, families, and online.\n\nApple is positioned well in the AI race because it has an installed base of over 2 billion active devices worldwide (iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and others). That means any AI application it releases is likely to immediately see widespread adoption, potentially even leapfrogging today's leaders like ChatGPT. AI might not be the reason Berkshire first bought Apple stock, but the technology could drive substantial long-term gains for the company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Snowflake wasn't one of them.

Although inflationary pressures made life difficult for consumers last year, they have been spending quite aggressively.\n\nA steady rise in personal income helped consumers spend quite freely, which helped the retail sector overcome the challenge of rising costs last year.\n\nAs inflation started declining, consumers grew more confident and continued to spend. This saw consumer sentiment jumping to a two-and-a-half-year high in January. The University of Michigan’s preliminary index of consumer sentiment came up with a reading of 78.8 in January, surpassing both the previous month’s reading and the consensus estimate of 69.7.\n\nMore importantly, in January, the sub-index for the current economic condition increased to 83.3 from 73.3 in December. Also, the sub-index for consumer expectations rose to 75.9 in January from 67.4 in December.\n\nThe survey's gauge of one-year inflation expectations decreased to 2.9% in January from 3.1% in the previous month, marking the lowest level since December 2020.\n\nDovish comments from Federal Reserve officials after increasing interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 are also boosting consumer sentiment. The Federal Reserve has signaled that its monetary tightening campaign is nearing its end and rate cuts are on the anvil.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates will boost consumers’ sentiment further as it will allow them to spend more lavishly. Given this situation, the retail sector is poised to gain the most as consumers who have been spending cautiously over the past year will now spend more on retail.\n\nRetail sales totaled $709.9 billion, increasing 0.6% month over month in December, beating expectations of a rise of 0.4%. The unexpected jump came as inflationary worries eased, making consumers more confident about the economy’s future.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this situation, investing in retail stocks like Wingstop Inc., Target Corp., Casey's General Stores, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc. and Deckers Outdoor Corp. looks like an ideal choice.

        "title": "Tesla Is Just a Car Company, and It's Time Wall Street Valued It as Such",
        "content": "There are few constants on Wall Street. But one thing investors can always count on is a next-big-thing trend demanding attention. For much of the past half-decade, electric vehicles (EVs) have ranked high on the list of game-changing innovations.\n\nAlthough estimates vary wildly, as you'd expect from any industry-changing technology, Fortune Business Insights has penciled in a nearly 18% compound annual growth rate for the worldwide EV market through 2030. By the turn of the decade, we could be talking about nearly $1.6 trillion in annual sales.\n\nAt the moment, North American EV leader Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is leading the charge (pardon the necessary pun). Led by outspoken CEO Elon Musk, Tesla has introduced five mass-produced models (3, S, Y, X, and Cybertruck), and spread its wings into energy, storage, and various services, including its Supercharger network. Image source: Tesla.\n\nWhile Tesla is viewed by its shareholders as something of an artificial intelligence (AI), technology, and automaking company rolled into one, I'm going to show you why it's nothing more than a car company that should be valued as such by Wall Street.\n\nTesla broke the mold for automakers\n\nBefore digging into what's wrong with Tesla and the lofty valuation Wall Street has bestowed on the most valuable automaker by market cap, let me start by giving the company credit where credit is due.\n\nTesla became the first auto company in more than a half-decade to organically build itself from the ground up to mass production. That didn't happen by accident. Although it took a lot of capital, Tesla has seen its Model Y sport utility vehicle blossom into the best-selling vehicle in the world, based on the company's own preliminary data.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla has become the only pure-play EV manufacturer to generate a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). On Wednesday, Jan. 24, it reported its fourth consecutive year of GAAP profits. While legacy automakers are often generating sizable profits from their internal-combustion engine vehicles, their EV segments are bleeding red.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'll also add that investors appreciate the innovative capacity that Elon Musk has brought to the table. He's overseen the launch of Models 3, S, X, and Y, along with the Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, and a host of battery/storage solutions. It's fair to question if Tesla would be worth anywhere close to $661 billion without Elon Musk steering the ship.\n\nLet's face the facts: Tesla is just a car company\n\nBut this brings me back to the point at hand, Tesla's valuation. A roughly $661 billion market cap equates to the combined market value of many of the largest automakers. Tesla sustains this ultra-premium valuation on the basis that it's an AI-driven technology company. But dig into its operating results and history of fulfilling the promises made by Elon Musk and you'll find otherwise.\n\nFor example, Tesla brought in $96.8 billion in total revenue in 2023. Only $6 billion derived from its Energy Generation and Storage segment, with an additional $8.3 billion traced back to its \"Services and other revenue.\" This means 85% of the company's revenue comes from selling and leasing EVs.\n\nAs a company like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has shown, it's OK for ancillary operating segments to do the heavy lifting, with regard to operating income and cash flow. Although Amazon generates the bulk of its revenue from its online marketplace, most of its operating income and cash flow comes from its world-leading cloud infrastructure service segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS makes up just a sixth of Amazon's net sales, but has accounted for the entirety of Amazon's operating income in select quarters.\n\nHowever, Tesla's ancillary segments are mostly for show, at least from an operating standpoint. Though total storage deployed (in megawatt (MW)-hours) rose by 125% in 2023 from the prior-year period, solar deployed (in MW) declined by 36% from 2022. Despite Energy Generation and Storage revenue rising by 10% during the fourth quarter from the prior-year period, it was down from what was reported in the first, second, and third quarter of 2023.\n\nFurthermore, Services revenue of $2.166 billion was flat in the fourth quarter from the sequential third quarter, with a gross margin of just 2.7%. Once operating expenses are factored in, neither Energy Generation and Storage nor Services are doing much of anything to move the needle for Tesla. The Model 3 is Tesla's flagship sedan. Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla's auto business is facing mounting headwinds\n\nThe painful truth for Tesla is that it's a more or less average automaker contending with mounting headwinds in a highly competitive industry.\n\nBeginning in early 2023, Tesla began slashing the selling price on Models 3, S, X, and Y. Although optimists had assumed that these price cuts were strategic and based on improving production efficiencies, Musk noted during Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in May that the company's price cuts were in response to demand. Waning demand, coupled with rising global inventory, have more than halved Tesla's operating margin since September 2022 (17.2% to 8.2%).\n\nIf Tesla were producing a superior operating margin to other auto stocks, an argument could be made that it deserved a premium valuation. But most time-tested legacy automakers are generating operating margins right around 8%, give or take a percentage point in each direction. Tesla's forward price-to-earnings ratio comes in at 10 times the industry average despite delivering a run-of-the-mill operating margin.\n\nTo add to the above, a substantial percentage of Tesla's pre-tax income comes from unsustainable sources. You'd expect an innovative, high-growth company to generate organic growth by selling its core product(s). In Tesla's case, I'm talking about selling EVs, and to a far lesser extent generating a profit from the ancillary segments described above.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Tesla generated $433 million in profit from selling automotive regulatory credits given to it for free by governments. It also netted $333 million in interest income from its sizable cash pile. The world's largest EV company by market cap earned 35% of its $2.191 billion in pre-tax income in the fourth quarter from selling tax credits and generating interest on its cash. That's hardly \"innovative.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Elon Musk has a terrible habit of overpromising and underdelivering on new vehicles and innovations. For instance, not only was the launch of the Cybertruck delayed, but its production ramp is expected to be slower than Tesla's other models because of the complexity of the vehicle.\n\nOther examples of failing to deliver include the now-annual promise made by Musk that Level 5 autonomy is \"one year away,\" as well as Musk's commentary in 2019 that his company would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by \"the end of next year.\" While Tesla's side projects (e.g., Optimus robots) can be fun talking points, they don't provide any tangible value to the business. TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMost auto stocks are valued at 6 to 8 times forward-year earnings. Based on Wall Street's profit consensus for Tesla of $3.67 per share entering 2024, this would put Tesla's share price between $22 and $29 to be on-par with the auto industry. While an argument can be made that Tesla deserves a premium to traditional automakers given its first-mover advantages in the EV space, a triple-digit share price simply can't be supported given the company's operating performance and history of failing to meet production and innovation targets.\n\nIt's time to face the fact that Tesla is just a car company, and Wall Street should value it as such.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Walmart\n\nWhen our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nThese warnings coincided with a two-year-long slowdown in dealmaking across the business world as executives turned more cautious about the economic outlook and geopolitical unrest.\n\nLast year was the worst year in a decade for revenue from investment banking, a pullback that dragged down results across Wall Street.\n\nBut the administration's track record in actually stopping deals from happening once they were announced had not been great until recently.\n\nThe FTC, in fact, has been handed some high-profile defeats in some prominent cases, including suits to stop Microsoft's acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard and Meta's acquisition of virtual reality app developer Within.\n\n'This one's for you'\n\nWashington is having more success with the airline industry, however.\n\nFirst a federal judge agreed with the Justice Department that a partnership between JetBlue and American Airlines (AAL) to coordinate routes and schedules in the northeast section of the US would be anti-competitive, a ruling that forced the carriers to end that agreement last year.\n\nThen this month another federal judge blocked the union of JetBlue and Spirit, the sixth-largest and seventh-largest airlines in the US, arguing that removing Spirit as an independent carrier would mean higher prices for consumers.\n\n\"To those dedicated customers of Spirit, this one’s for you,\" wrote the judge, William Young.\n\nWhat was notable about the scuttled deal is that it turned in part on a novel DOJ theory, according to Gleklen, the partner with Arnold & Palmer’s antitrust group. Federal officials argued Spirit Airlines operated in a different market than traditional passenger airlines because it offered ultra low-cost fares.\n\n\"That's a more aggressive theory,\" he said, explaining that past airline merger challenges treated commercial air carriers as equals, regardless of the average fare prices.\n\nTD Cowen airline analyst Helane Becker said she expected the judge overseeing the challenge would ultimately let the JetBlue-Sprit deal go through.\n\nBut \"I think the DOJ wound up making a strong case and issued concerns for low fares in the South Florida market, especially for visiting friends and relatives because that's a big part of Spirit's business plan.\"\n\nThe ruling, though, does present challenges to both companies and raises questions about what's next — particularly for Spirit, whose clock is ticking with $1.1 billion in debt due in September 2025. The carriers have said they will appeal the ruling.\n\n\"When you do a little more digging, you find that Spirit may have a hard time surviving without this merger,\" Becker said.\n\nSome of these same legal theories will get another test as the Justice Department soon is expected to weigh in on another proposed merger between Alaska (ALK) and Hawaiian. Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines planes take off at the same time from San Francisco International Airport.

Federal officials argued Spirit Airlines operated in a different market than traditional passenger airlines because it offered ultra low-cost fares.\n\n\"That's a more aggressive theory,\" he said, explaining that past airline merger challenges treated commercial air carriers as equals, regardless of the average fare prices.\n\nTD Cowen airline analyst Helane Becker said she expected the judge overseeing the challenge would ultimately let the JetBlue-Sprit deal go through.\n\nBut \"I think the DOJ wound up making a strong case and issued concerns for low fares in the South Florida market, especially for visiting friends and relatives because that's a big part of Spirit's business plan.\"\n\nThe ruling, though, does present challenges to both companies and raises questions about what's next — particularly for Spirit, whose clock is ticking with $1.1 billion in debt due in September 2025. The carriers have said they will appeal the ruling.\n\n\"When you do a little more digging, you find that Spirit may have a hard time surviving without this merger,\" Becker said.\n\nSome of these same legal theories will get another test as the Justice Department soon is expected to weigh in on another proposed merger between Alaska (ALK) and Hawaiian. Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines planes take off at the same time from San Francisco International Airport.

        "content": "Consumers allow businesses to operate and grow. Knowing where people put their money and what industries are heating up can help you discover profitable investment opportunities.\n\nWhile we all have to buy the necessities, many people have extra money lying around after buying their essentials. While some of this money gets saved, some of it will also go into discretionary purchases. These buys stimulate the economy and reward shareholders who invest in the right companies. Investors looking to diversify into consumer discretionary stocks may want to consider these three picks.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) caters to people who want to look and feel great. The firm offers many cosmetics and beauty products, but there’s one key difference. Elf Beauty uses cruelty-free ingredients. Many cosmetic products use ingredients that require animal testing. It’s a gruesome process that Elf Beauty bypasses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nElf Beauty has been a hit with Gen Z and has experienced tremendous revenue and net income acceleration in recent quarters. The beauty brand increased its sales by 76% year over year (YOY) in Q2 of fiscal 2024. Further, net income growth almost tripled.\n\nMoreover, ELF is a profitable company that currently has a 51-forward P/E ratio. Not everyone may like that multiple. But investors who hold onto the stock for 5-10 years have plenty of time for that valuation to become more attractive.\n\nSo far, the long-term approach has worked well for shareholders. The stock has gained 185% over the past year and has increased by 1,723% over the past five years.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a thriving fast food restaurant that has established itself as a healthier alternative to big-name fast food joints. Investors have bid up shares to a 46% gain over the past year. The stock has marched up by 328% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, the fast food chain delivered another strong quarter. The company wrapped up Q3 2023 with an 11.3% YOY revenue increase and a 21.8% YOY growth in net income.\n\nFurther, Chipotle expanded its physical footprint with an additional 62 restaurants. “Chipotlanes” allow customers to pick up digital orders without leaving their cars. So, the company’s fast-growing segment is included in 54 of those locations. Chipotle aimed to close out 2023 with 255-285 new restaurant openings. The company will then strive to open 285-315 new restaurants this year.\n\nThus, investors should feel good about a company that expanded in 2023 and wants to do more next year. That’s one of the signs of a good business model.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an e-commerce juggernaut that saves people time and offers millions of product choices. You can find almost everything that you need on Amazon. And, that distinction helped the tech conglomerate become one of the largest companies in history.\n\nCurrently, Amazon has a $1.6 trillion market cap and continues to deliver for investors. Shares are up by 59% over the past year and have gained 85% over the past five years.\n\nWhile many people think of Amazon for its online marketplace, the company has evolved. Amazon Web Services (AWS)has become a large segment, and advertising has immense potential between Twitch, Amazon’s online marketplace, and other assets.\n\nThe tech giant grew sales by 13% YOY in the third quarter with an emphasis on international expansion. International sales grew by 16% YOY while the larger North American segment only generated 11% YOY growth.\n\nAlso, Amazon is an innovator in artificial intelligence, focusing on generative AI. Amazon Bedrock makes it easy for developers to build and scale generative AI applications. Therefore, this new venture can help the company generate higher returns for shareholders.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in ELF.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks are the type of investment that allows people to sleep soundly at night. These are the shares of established companies that are profitable, have clean balance sheets, and have a track record of performance. Banks, insurers and healthcare companies are examples of rock-solid blue-chip stocks.\n\nThey may not be flashy or exciting, but they can deliver steady gains to investors over the long term and are far less risky than many growth stocks and shares of start-up companies. Importantly, blue-chip stocks tend to fall less during a market correction and recover faster when the bulls start running again on Wall Street. Here are three blue-chip stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest healthcare insurer in the U.S., remains a great blue-chip stock to buy and hold forever. And there’s an opportunity to buy the dip in the stock after its recent fourth-quarter financial results. While the company beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines, its stock has slumped after it reported a higher-than-expected utilization rate for medical services, which can eat into profits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYear-to-date, UNH stock has declined 5%. However, the company’s share price has still doubled over the past five years. Healthcare stocks often perform well in election years. An 18-forward P/E ratio is low for UNH stock. UnitedHealth also pays a quarterly dividend of $1.88 per share, giving it a yield of 1.50%.\n\nThomson Reuters (TRI) newspaper with \"etf\" circled. etfs to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIt’s a challenging time for media companies, especially newspapers. The industry is awash in layoffs and red ink. Yet Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) continues to buck the trend and its stock is now trading near an all-time high. The company’s bread-and-butter continues to be its international newswire, which media outlets are relying on more than ever as they cut back their own newsrooms. However, Thomson Reuters continues to make strategic investments in new areas, including artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nStory continues\n\nMost recently, Thomson Reuters has increased an offer it made to buy Swedish tax preparation firm Pagero by 25% to $789 million. Thomson Reuters already controls 54% of Pagero and is seeking to gain 100% control of the company, which it hopes to add to its other accounting services that include digital firms such as Checkpoint. Thomson Reuters has a strategy to grow through mergers and acquisitions and has a $10 billion M&A budget through 2025.\n\nTRI stock has gained 22% in the last 12 months and is up 181% over five years.\n\neBay (EBAY) Indicators Say Stay on Sidelines When It Comes to eBay Stock\n\nSource: Mano Kors / Shutterstock.com\n\nA lot of people are down on e-commerce company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). But the company’s current valuation is dirt cheap and the company continues to implement a turnaround strategy that could make it a worthwhile long-term investment. Right now, EBAY stock is trading at only eight times future earnings estimates, which is about as cheap as you’ll find for a technology concern. Also, the shares come with a quarterly dividend payment of 25 cents a share, giving it a yield of 2.40%.\n\nMost technology stocks, including e-commerce rival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), pay no dividend. Additionally, eBay just announced plans to eliminate 9% of its workforce, or about 1,000 full-time employees, as it seeks to control costs and lower expenses over the coming year. Last fall, eBay issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance for the holiday sales period that fell short of Wall Street estimates, causing its stock to drop. But over five years, EBAY stock is up 23%, with future gains likely.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. received inquiries from the US Federal Trade Commission on their investments and partnerships with artificial intelligence startups Anthropic and OpenAI, part of a study on how AI is impacting competition in the technology industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Sinks After Warning About ‘Notably Lower’ Growth Rate Putin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Sensing Advantage in War US GDP Grew 3.3% Last Quarter, Capping Unexpectedly Strong Year Microsoft Cuts 1,900 Jobs in Gaming, Including at Activision\n\nThe antitrust and consumer protection agency on Thursday said it sent subpoenas to the companies to gather information. The probe focuses on more than $19 billion in investments by Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google, a series of transactions that cemented alliances between the world’s cloud-services giants and the leading developers of artificial intelligence software.\n\nAntitrust enforcers across the world have become concerned as many of the most promising AI startups now depend heavily on the old guard of dominant tech companies for their financing and infrastructure needs.\n\nIn comments during a public workshop Thursday, FTC Chair Lina Khan said the agency is closely monitoring the industry and warned that AI companies “cannot use claims of innovation as cover for law breaking.”\n\n“There is no AI exemption from the laws on the books,” she said.\n\nGoogle said it doesn’t have exclusive rights to Anthropic’s technology, and its investment doesn’t include a board seat or voting rights.\n\n“We hope the FTC’s study will shine a bright light on companies that don’t offer the openness of Google Cloud,” said Peter Schottenfels, a company spokesperson.\n\nMicrosoft said the US is a leader in artificial intelligence because of collaborations between American companies.\n\n“Partnerships between independent companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, as well as among many others, are promoting competition and accelerating innovation,” said Rima Alaily, Microsoft’s top competition lawyer. “We look forward to providing the FTC with the information it needs to complete its study.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon and Anthropic declined to comment. OpenAI didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe inquiry comes as technology giants take a bigger role in backing nimble AI startups in a bid to stake a claim in the booming sector. Over the past year, Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around AI tools powered by OpenAI’s technology, while Google has said it plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into its experimental search tool sometime this year.\n\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The ouster and subsequent reinstatement of Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive officer, in November exposed how inextricably linked Microsoft and the company have become. Those ties have already spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, Google in October committed to back Anthropic with $2 billion, and Amazon last year also agreed to an investment of as much as $4 billion. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, who left that company amid differences over the direction of the business.\n\nRead More: Big Tech’s Massive AI Startup Deals, By the Numbers\n\nRebecca Kelly Slaughter, one of the FTC’s three Democrats, criticized the tech giants for structuring their transactions in a way designed to avoid the US merger law that would have required them to notify antitrust enforcers.\n\n“It’s reasonable to wonder whether these investments could lead to a heavily consolidated market dominated by only a few,” she said at the same workshop where Khan spoke.\n\nBut, she warned, “studying a market is a compliment to, and not a substitute for, appropriate enforcement.”\n\nMicrosoft didn’t report the OpenAI transaction to the agency because the investment doesn’t amount to control of the company under US law, Bloomberg has reported. OpenAI is also a nonprofit, and acquisitions of non-corporate entities aren’t reported under US merger law, regardless of value.\n\nIn the case of Google and Amazon, the deals were structured as convertible notes, a type of debt that will convert to equity at the startup’s next funding round. Those don’t require notification to the agency until they’re converted.\n\nThe FTC is conducting the inquiry under its so-called 6(b) authority that allows it to issue subpoenas to conduct market studies. The agency generally issues a report on its findings after analyzing the information from companies, though that process can take years to complete. The agency is still finalizing the results of studies on pharmaceutical middlemen and supply chains that it started in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAlthough the information is collected for research purposes, the FTC can use any details it gleans to open official investigations or aid in existing probes. Last summer, the agency opened an investigation into whether OpenAI has violated consumer protection laws with its popular ChatGPT conversational AI bot.\n\nThe FTC and its sister agency, the Justice Department, share jurisdiction over antitrust probes and have been debating internally which should take the lead on AI. The Justice Department has generally handled antitrust issues related to Microsoft since its blockbuster monopolization case against the Windows maker in the late 1990s. The FTC, however, recently handled Microsoft’s acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard Inc.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission is looking into some of the agreements that have been struck between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers. The EU’s executive arm is investigating the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority said in December that it also would probe Microsoft and OpenAI’s partnership.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary, Julia Love, Matt Day and Jackie Davalos.\n\n(Updates with Google and Microsoft statements beginning in sixth paragraph. An earlier version’s ninth paragraph was corrected to show that Amazon invested in Anthropic in 2023, not this year.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Goldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Hong Kong Life in Amazon’s Expats Is Tragic, Lonely and Boring",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nicole Kidman showed up in Hong Kong to shoot the new Amazon miniseries, Expats, at a particularly awkward moment for the city. It was August 2021, when China (and by extension, Hong Kong) was steadfastly clinging to Covid Zero practices. Strictures included not just masks but school shutdowns, plexiglass partitions to separate diners in restaurants and—deeply infuriating to residents—one to three weeks of mandatory hotel quarantine for anyone arriving from overseas.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Sensing Advantage in War Tesla Sinks After Warning About ‘Notably Lower’ Growth Rate US GDP Grew 3.3% Last Quarter, Capping Unexpectedly Strong Year US Extends Lead Over China in Race for World’s Biggest Economy\n\nThe policies stripped Hong Kong of two of its best features—easy travel and a vibrant social scene—and the news that Kidman was being allowed to skip the mandatory confinement spread faster than any pathogen. Officials defended the exemption, saying the shoot would be good for Hong Kong’s battered economy and global reputation. True or not, it emphasized how absurd the city’s Covid policies had become. One lawmaker noted that she herself was bound to observe the rules of quarantine and wondered how her work “compares with that of a film star.”\n\nBut Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997, makes no pretensions of fairness. Expats, based on the novel by Janice Y.K. Lee, isn’t that interested, either.\n\nIt takes place in 2014, the year the pro-democracy Occupy protests shook the city for months, and focuses on three American women. Margaret (Kidman) is what’s known as a trailing spouse, having given up her work to enable her husband’s move to Hong Kong; her neighbor Hilary ( Sarayu Blue) has an ambiguous career, an unreliable husband and some amazing jumpsuits; newly graduated Mercy ( Ji-young Yoo) is desperate to outrun an old family curse.\n\nThe show opens roughly a year after the youngest of Margaret’s three children has gone missing, an horrific event that connects the women and defines them to varying degree. In flashback, the series deals with the more pedestrian dramas of Margaret’s previous life. She wants to go back to the US, where her friends were “CEOs, artists.” She’s at loose ends in their palatial apartment and jealous of the bond between her children and their live-in maid. “This isn’t real life,” she complains to her husband Clarke (Brian Tee). “There’s nothing wrong with spoiling ourselves a bit,” he tells her. “We deserve it.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd Clarke is the likable one. Unlike the others, he’s able to turn outward to the people around him. The first episode begins with preparations for his lavish 50th birthday party, an obviously strained and possibly misguided celebration under the circumstances. It’s also a rare moment in which we see any of the characters surrounded by any semblance of community. The three women, on the other hand, are mostly alone in their distress.\n\nIt’s bleak, and it’s boring. Not a lot happens. The characters agonize, make predictably unfortunate decisions and say things they regret. Overall, they hold themselves apart. Their deepest thoughts are expressed in voiceover, not to other people.\n\nIt doesn’t make for very compelling TV, but it does reveal an unflattering truth about expat life in Hong Kong: It can be a pretty self-centered undertaking. You’re thousands of miles and several time zones from the obligations of extended family, buffeted by perks and privileges and merely inconvenienced by even the most seismic political upheavals. It’s a nice bubble—until it pops.\n\nCreator Lulu Wang makes the most of Hong Kong as a backdrop, painting the city by turns exotic, fancy, impenetrable and lonely. There’s the skyline and the harbor, sure, but also the escalators, the unmistakable tiling in the metro, the winding roads, the multicolored housing estates. In a scene at the sprawling Hong Kong International Airport, a teenage girl complains about the long walk to the gate.\n\nFor all the detailed and loving cinematography, Expats feels oddly placeless. The same story could unfold in a wealthy enclave in Dubai, London or Mexico City. That’s part of the point, I’m sure, but Hong Kong is far from a neutral backdrop. Its future feels precarious for the 7.8 million people who live here, almost all of whom are local or mainland Chinese. Of the roughly 620,000 foreign residents, most are domestic workers and drivers, not well-compensated executives.\n\nThere’s only one memorable local character in the series, played by Hong Kong native Bonde Sham: Charly, a young activist who gets involved with Mercy. Their ultimate falling out doesn’t make a lot of sense, but her parting shot lands. “You’re a tourist! [The protests] don’t affect your future. You can just leave—another blessing I’m sure you can’t see.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Goldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?

        "content": "In this article, we look at the 30 most polluted countries in the world heading into 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis on corporations that have committed themselves to tackling pollution and head over directly to the 10 Most Polluted Countries in the World Heading into 2024.\n\nWhile humanity has progressed immensely over this past century, it has not come without a cost. With approximately 100,000 daily flights ferrying passengers over the skies, 1.5 billion cars on the road, and uncountable numbers of products churned out of factories each day, the standard of living has certainly risen – but with it, so have global carbon emissions. A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in March last year stated that carbon emissions rose 0.9% in 2022 to reach an all-time high of 36.8 Gt.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, vehicle emissions, by-products of manufacturing, fuels from chemical production, coal power plants, and use of natural gas to heat homes are the primary sources of human-induced air pollution, and subsequently these contribute to global warming. A report in Reuters last year highlighted that 98% of the world’s population got exposed to global warming between June and September 2023.\n\nSeveral large corporations have in recent years taken measures to control pollution and protect the environment. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2020 announced that it would purchase credits for sustainable aviation fuel from SkyNRG to reduce pollution caused by its employees’ commercial flights. Business travel accounted for 3% of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s carbon emissions in 2019. The plan involved Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) buying credits from SkyNRG and supplying it to Alaska Airlines to operate flights between Seattle and San Francisco, San Jose, and Los Angeles.\n\nLast year in September, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced an investment in direct air capture (DAC) technology, which cleans the atmosphere from emissions. The company said it will purchase 250,000 tonnes of removal credits from 1PointFive’s DAC plant in Texas over the next 10 years. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) believes this decision will contribute towards meeting its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. While Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not reveal the financial aspects of the investment, a news story in Reuters quoting developers of DAC technology reported that these removal credits cost in the range of mid-to-high-triple digits per metric tonne.\n\nStory continues\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has also aligned its offerings with environmental needs. In 2018, the company announced that it was pivoting from taxis to scooters and e-bikes, with a key focus on sustainability. During the same year, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) launched e-bikes in the United States, and also acquired JUMP, a bike-sharing startup, for $200 million. Two years later in 2020, the company invested $170 million in Lime, an electric scooter company.\n\nAfter successfully launching e-bikes in Europe and North America, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) entered African markets in August 2023, starting with its electric motorbike service in Kenya, which resulted in its stocks gaining 3.7% over the next two months according to NASDAQ. You can read more on this in our article on the 20 Most Bicycle-Friendly Countries in the World. 30 Most Polluted Countries in the World Heading into 2024\n\nHung Chung Chih/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have ranked the most polluted countries in the world by using two metrics – air pollution and water quality. Data for air pollution has been sourced from our article, 30 Most Air Polluted Countries in the World, whereas the 2022 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) was considered for water quality levels with respect to drinking and sanitation.\n\nAfter seeing how each country ranked on both of these metrics, we averaged their rankings. Suppose, a country ranked as the most (1st) polluted country in terms of air quality and ranked 3rd when it came to water pollution, it received a score of 2 (1+3 divided by 2). Countries are listed in this article in descending order of their average ranking scores.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 30 Least Polluted Countries in the World.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet’s now head over to the list of the most polluted countries in the world.\n\n30. Guatemala\n\nScore: 37.5\n\nGuatemala is one of the most polluted countries in the world, with solid waste management being a serious environmental issue, and its water bodies also exhibiting high levels of pollution.\n\n29. Iran\n\nScore: 37\n\nAir pollution is a chronic problem in Iran, where its capital Tehran is among the most polluted cities in the world. According to IQAir, Iran ranks as the 21st most polluted country in terms of air quality with an PM2.5 concentration of 32.5 μg/m³. Much of this is attributed to emissions from millions of old cars on the road, as well as smoke from factories and power plants.\n\n28. Peru\n\nScore: 36.5\n\nPeru is among the most polluted countries in Latin America, with pollution levels being particularly high in urban centers such as Lima. The country ranks 103rd in the world when it comes to water quality, with an EPI score of 43/100 according to the Environmental Performance Index.\n\n27. Uzbekistan\n\nScore: 34\n\nUzbekistan is the 20th most polluted country in the world based on air quality, according to IQAir, with a PM2.5 concentration of 33.5 μg/m³. It ranks 77th globally for sanitation and drinking water.\n\n26. Bahrain\n\nScore: 32.5\n\nBahrain has the fourth worst air quality in the world, with a PM2.5 concentration of 66.6 μg/m³. Much of its air problem is owed to sandstorms and the high use of private vehicles. The country fares much better when it comes to water quality and has an EPI score of 56.6 out of 100.\n\n25. Mongolia\n\nScore: 32\n\nThe annual PM2.5 concentration in Mongolia of 29.5 μg/m³ is more than five times higher than WHO’s recommended levels. One of the major reasons why Mongolia ranks among the most polluted countries in the world is the reliance on coal as the primary fuel for urban heating.\n\n24. Kyrgyzstan\n\nScore: 31\n\nKyrgyzstan’s capital Bishkek was ranked as the second most polluted city in the world in 2022, after which the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) urged the country to move away from coal towards more energy-efficient alternatives. Kyrgyzstan also ranks low on water quality, with an EPI of 45.5 out of 100.\n\n23. Myanmar\n\nScore: 29\n\nMyanmar is Southeast Asia’s most polluted country with a PM2.5 concentration of 24.3 μg/m³. According to the Air Quality Life Index 2022, life expectancy in Myanmar would increase by 2.7 years if the country was to reduce pollution levels to meet WHO’s pollution guidelines of 5 µg/m³.\n\n22. South Africa\n\nScore: 27.5\n\nSouth Africa has the 16th highest level of water pollution in the world. According to a report, 46% of the country’s water supply systems are contaminated by bacteria and sewage, and do not meet microbiological standards. A primary reason behind this is industrial waste getting dumped into rivers.\n\n21. Senegal\n\nScore: 27\n\nSenegal is one of the most polluted countries in the world. According to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), the country ranks seventh on water pollution. On the other hand, it is the 47th most polluted country in terms of air quality with a PM2.5 concentration of 20.4 μg/m³.\n\n20. Gabon\n\nScore: 26\n\nThe primary causes of pollution in Gabon range from carbon emissions from vehicles, construction, factories and burning stubble, to the release of harmful gasses from cooking fuels. The air quality in the country starts to deteriorate in October, with winters being the worst-hit season in Gabon in terms of air pollution.\n\n19. Indonesia\n\nScore: 24\n\nIndonesia is the 26th most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with a PM2.5 concentration of 30.4 μg/m³. In August 2023, Jakarta became the most polluted city in the world for a brief period of time. The country does not fare any better in water quality either, ranking 125th when it comes to clean drinking water and sanitation.\n\n18. Iraq\n\nScore: 23.5\n\nPollution is a serious environmental issue in Iraq. The war-torn country is the second most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, and is only next to Chad, with a staggeringly high PM2.5 concentration of 80.1 μg/m³.\n\n17. Laos\n\nScore: 23\n\nAccording to a report, nearly 10,000 people die in Laos every year from causes related to pollution, of which 44% are linked to household air pollution. The country has a PM2.5 concentration of 27.6 μg/m³, while it is the 17th worst country for water quality with an EPI of 26.5 out of 100.\n\n16. Zambia\n\nScore: 21\n\nZambia is one of the most polluted countries in the world. A vast majority of the population in the country relies on firewood and charcoal for cooking food and heating, which is a contributing factor in the pollution over there. Zambia ranks as the eighth worst country in terms of water quality as well with an EPI of just 13.4 out of 100.\n\n15. Ghana\n\nScore: 20.5\n\nGhana’s water bodies exhibit a high level of pollution. The air quality in the African country also remains poor with a PM2.5 concentration of 30.2 μg/m³.\n\n14. Madagascar\n\nScore: 19.5\n\nAbout one in three people in Madagascar experience premature death due to pollution. It has the third highest water pollution level in the world, with an EPI of just 5.9 out of 100.\n\n13. Egypt\n\nScore: 18.5\n\nEgypt is one of the most polluted countries in the world. Due to its close proximity to desert regions, the country receives a large portion of dust from surrounding areas. According to IQAir, the air quality in Egypt is between 10-100 times more polluted than the global acceptable standards with levels varying throughout the year.\n\n12. Tajikistan\n\nScore: 17\n\nTajikistan is the tenth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with a PM2.5 concentration of 46 μg/m³. The country ranks low when it comes to clean water and sanitation as well, with an EPI of 30.9 out of 100.\n\n11. Nepal\n\nScore: 16.5\n\nPollution levels have been deteriorating in the landlocked South Asian country, Nepal. In April 2023, its capital Kathmandu was the most polluted city in the world for about a week. Nepal has a PM2.5 concentration of 40.1 μg/m³, and an EPI score for water quality of 27 out of 100.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 10 Most Polluted Countries in the World Heading into 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n30 Most Polluted Cities in the U.S. 25 US Cities with Cleanest Air and Water 25 Most Polluted Cities in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 30 Most Polluted Countries in the World Heading into 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. must provide information to the US Federal Trade Commission on their investments and partnerships with artificial intelligence startups Anthropic PBC and OpenAI Inc. as part of an agency study announced Thursday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Sinks After Warning About ‘Notably Lower’ Growth Rate US GDP Grew 3.3% Last Quarter, Capping Unexpectedly Strong Year Microsoft Cuts 1,900 Jobs in Gaming, Including at Activision Boeing Blocked From Building More 737s in Hit to Growth Plan\n\nThe antitrust and consumer protection agency said it sent subpoenas to the companies to gather information on how the development of AI is impacting the competitive landscape. The inquiry focuses on more than $19 billion in investments by Microsoft, Amazon and Google, in a series of transactions that cemented alliances between the world’s cloud services giants with the leading providers of artificial intelligence software.\n\nAntitrust enforcers across the world have become concerned as many of the most promising AI startups now depend heavily on the old guard of dominant tech companies for their financing and infrastructure needs.\n\nIn comments during a public workshop Thursday, FTC Chair Lina Khan said the agency is closely monitoring the industry and warned that AI companies “cannot use claims of innovation as cover for law breaking.”\n\n“There is no AI exemption from the laws on the books,” she said.\n\nGoogle and Anthropic declined to comment. Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe inquiry comes as technology giants take a bigger role in backing nimble AI startups in a bid to claim a stake in the booming sector. Over the past year, Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around AI tools powered by OpenAI’s AI mode, while Google has said it has plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into its experimental search tool sometime this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker OpenAI and the ouster of its CEO Sam Altman in November exposed how inextricably linked Microsoft and the company have become. Those ties have spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees, who left the company amid differences over the direction of the business. Alphabet’s Google in October committed to back it with $2 billion, and earlier this year Amazon agreed to an investment of as much as $4 billion.\n\nThe FTC is conducting the inquiry under its so-called 6(b) authority that allows it to issue subpoenas to conduct market studies. The agency generally issues a report on its findings after analyzing the information from companies, though that process can take years to complete. The agency is still finalizing the results of studies on pharmaceutical middlemen and supply chains that it started in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAlthough the information is collected for research purposes, the FTC can use any details it gleans to open official investigations or aid in existing probes. Last summer, the agency opened an investigation into whether OpenAI has violated consumer protection laws with its popular ChatGPT conversational AI bot.\n\nThe FTC and its sister agency, the Justice Department, share jurisdiction over antitrust probes and have been debating internally which should take the lead on the AI. The Justice Department has generally handled antitrust issues related to Microsoft since its blockbuster monopolization case against the Windows maker in the late 1990s. The FTC, however, recently handled Microsoft’s acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard Inc.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission is looking into some of the agreements that have been concluded between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers. The European Commission is investigating the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary, Julia Love, Matt Day and Jackie Davalos.\n\n(Updates with additional company comments in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround Goldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Can America’s New Union Hero Take on Elon Musk’s Tesla?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Prologis (NYSE:PLD), with its dividend yield of 2.7%, offers a unique investment opportunity in the real estate sector, focusing on industrial logistics properties. This specialization is particularly timely, tapping into the exponential growth of e-commerce and the consequent demand for distribution centers and warehouses. The surge in online shopping, accelerated by digital transformation and consumer behavior shifts, makes Prologis a strategic choice for investors aiming for consistent, growth-oriented returns.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of investing in Prologis is the indirect connection it offers to one of the world's largest e-commerce companies, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). While Prologis’ tenants are diverse, Amazon stands out as a notable lessee, making an investment in Prologis an indirect way of tapping into the retail giant's expansive growth. This relationship with Amazon adds a fascinating dimension to Prologis' investment appeal – it's like earning dividends from Amazon's continued expansion and dominance in the e-commerce sector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nInvestors usually face a trade-off between growth and income; high-growth investments rarely provide regular income, and high-dividend stocks often don't offer substantial growth prospects. Prologis, however, breaks this mold. By investing in the logistics real estate that is fundamental to the operation of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Prologis is firmly positioned in a rapidly growing sector. At the same time, its status as a REIT means it distributes the majority of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrologis owns and manages a vast array of logistics properties across strategic locations globally, including key urban and suburban areas. This extensive geographical footprint is vital in mitigating risks associated with regional economic variations. The company’s properties, which serve as critical hubs for e-commerce giants and supply chain operators, ensure a strong and diverse tenant base. The increasing reliance on efficient logistics and distribution networks underscores the long-term demand for Prologis’ properties.During the fourth quarter of 2023,  Prologis announced a dividend of $0.87 per share. The total dividends paid from January to December 2023 were $3.48.\n\nInvesting in Prologis offers more than a stake in industrial real estate; it provides a pathway to indirectly benefit from Amazon's success. As e-commerce continues to flourish, driven by consumer preferences and technological advancements, Prologis' role in this ecosystem becomes increasingly vital, potentially enhancing its dividend prospects. This connection offers a compelling reason for investors to consider Prologis as a way to diversify their portfolio and gain exposure to the booming e-commerce sector.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.  Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nImage Credit: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report PROLOGIS (PLD): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Want to Earn a Dividend from Amazon?

        "content": "Netflix’s NFLX efforts to bolster its content portfolio offerings on the back of its expanding partner base have been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nIts shares have gained 28.8% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 3.3%. The growth can be attributed to its expanding subscriber base, which contributes directly to its subscription revenues, the strength of its content portfolio and partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe company recently announced a long-term partnership with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which is part of TKO Group Holdings, Inc. TKO, to bring WWE’s RAW to air exclusively on Netflix every week starting January 2025.\r\n\r\nRAW, which airs on Mondays, is the top show on the Comcast-owned USA Network, with 17.5 million unique viewers over the course of the year.\r\n\r\nThe rights deal that cost over $5 billion will span a period of 10 years. For the time being, RAW will be aired only in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Latin America.\r\n\r\nWith this partnership, Netflix aims to boost revenues and gain subscribers from the United States and Canada (UCAN) region as well as from the Latin America (LATAM) region. In the fourth quarter, the company gained 2.81 million and 2.35 million paid subscribers from the UCAN and LATAM regions, respectively.\r\n\r\nOutside the United States, Netflix will exclusively telecast RAW and WWE’s other weekly shows like SmackDown and NXT, premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble as well as documentaries, original series and upcoming projects in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe RAW deal marks Netflix's first long-term bet on live events that appeal to a loyal, multi-generational base of fans who watch WWE each week. Live sports can become an excellent way for Netflix to retain these viewers who may otherwise have passed on a Netflix membership after its password-sharing crackdown.\n\nNetflix, Inc. Price and Consensus Netflix, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc. Quote\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix’s Growing Subscriber Base to Fend Off Competition\n\nThis Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is riding on an expanding subscriber base and a strong portfolio of content, which is expected to drive top-line growth in the near term and fend off competition from its contenders like Amazon AMZN and Roku ROKU. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nRecently, Amazon announced a partnership with Diamond Sports Group. Amazon Prime Video will become the primary streaming partner to air the group’s live content. This will give Prime Video users access to content like live MLB, NBA and NHL games, and others.\r\n\r\nRoku announced a partnership with Tennis Channel to launch the latter’s second channel, T2, on The Roku Channel, providing free and continuous access to live coverage of top tennis players and signature events for its 100 million strong audience.\r\n\r\nNetflix is set to launch a pipeline of sports content on its platform in the near term. These include the episodes of NASCAR: Full Speed (Season 1), Sunderland ‘Til I Die (Season 3), Formula 1: Drive to Survive (Season 6), Full Swing (Season 2), Tour de France: Unchained (Season 2) and more.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, Netflix had 260.28 million paid subscribers globally, up 12.8% year over year. For the first quarter of 2024, Netflix expects paid net sub additions to be down sequentially (reflecting seasonality as well as possible pull forward from the strong fourth-quarter 2023 results) but up by 1.8 million year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Netflix’s 2024 revenues is pegged at $38.40 billion, indicating growth of 13.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings has increased by 11 cents over the past 30 days to $16.08 per share.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Amazon (AMZN) reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis online retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +281%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $166.19 billion, up 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.81% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amazon?\n\nFor Amazon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.58%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Amazon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amazon would post earnings of $0.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of +46.55%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAmazon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, Match Group (MTCH), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share for the quarter ended December 2023.

        "title": "Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer said in a latest program on CNBC that \"all is not well in corporate America.\" Cramer was referring to weak earnings which according to him show that the state of the economy is \"sluggish.\" Cramer said that we are \"hearing\" that the Fed might not be done tightening or at least be \"reluctant to cut in the spring\" because inflation remains sticky. Jim Cramer said that when the Fed began hiking interest rates stocks were punished and when the Fed pivoted near the end of 2023 stocks exploded which included many companies which, according to Cramer, didn’t \"deserve\" to see their stock prices soar.\n\nJim Cramer said that latest earnings show the effects of the Fed's tightening. He said many companies that raised prices are now seeing sales declines, which means they will have to roll back price hikes which would affect their stock prices. Cramer said it's \"disturbing\" but it's part of the business cycle.\n\n\"Throw Out the Old Playbook\"\n\nIn a separate program, Jim Cramer said the Fed's tightening cycle is peculiar in nature in its effects on stocks. Cramer said homebuilder stocks like Pulte Group, Lennar and Toll Brothers are going higher despite rate hikes while in the past homebuilder stocks always got punished during rate hikes. Cramer said in any \"normal\" tightening cycle stocks from homebuilding, steel and industrials sectors would get slaughtered but in this cycle many of the stocks from these sectors touched new highs.\n\nCramer also said the \"AI craze should have ended ages ago\" but stocks like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are still going higher. Cramer said that means AI was not a hype, after all.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer also said people kept complaining about lack of market breadth and the concentration of market gains in a few companies often called the Magnificent Seven group. Cramer said this lack of breadth has not mattered \"one bit.\"\n\nCramer said when the market is not sticking to the old playbook anymore, you've \"got to throw out\" the playbook and write a new one. Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds?Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer recently recommended investors to \"hold\" BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock. Cramer said he does not understand why this stock is so \"inexpensive.\" Over the past one year BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock has lost about 31%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX). The most significant stakeholder of BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) during this period was Israel Englander's Millennium Management which owns a $54 million stake in BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX).\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Notable trims in the quarter included Zscaler, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Ingersoll Rand. BioNTech is a biotech company focused on developing immunotherapies to treat cancer and other serious diseases. Management has been using its COVID-19 vaccine cash flows to reinvest in building a substantial early stage pipeline. The company’s intellectual property in mRNA and COVID-funded manufacturing capacity leave it well positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While we are optimistic that this pipeline will eventually yield promising medications within oncology and infectious diseases, patience will be required. In the meantime, demand for COVID-19 vaccine boosters continues to wane. Therefore, we decided to trim the position in favor of more compelling near-term opportunities.”\n\n9. Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nA caller recently asked Jim Cramer during his program about his thoughts on buying some more Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) stock. Cramer said you \"should\" buy more shares of the industrial tools company. Cramer highlighted the stock's over 3% dividend yield. Cramer said that if people are buying Home Depot on lows, they should be buying Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK).\n\n8. Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS), Jim Cramer said it is the \"best one of the silver companies.\"\n\n\"Holy cow, they crushed it,\" said Jim Cramer about the Canada-headquartered mining company.\n\nFor 2024, Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS) expects its total silver production to be between 21 million to 23 million ounces, while total gold production is expected to be between 880K - 1,000K ounces.\n\nA total of 22 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS). The most notable stakeholder of Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS) during this period was David Greenspan's Slate Path Capital which owns a $76 million stake in Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS).\n\n7. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 36\n\nJim Cramer recently recommended investors to buy gold stocks. Here's what Jim Cramer said when he was asked whether Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) stock should be bought:\n\n\"When rates go up, people sell gold, and that means you should buy gold. Because we buy gold for insurance.”\n\nIn December, Barron's published a list of its favorite stock picks for 2024. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) made it to the list. Barron's likes Barrick Gold Corp's (NYSE:GOLD) plans to increase mine output by 30% by the end of the decade. Barron's thinks Barrick Gold Corp's (NYSE:GOLD) CEO Mark Bristow is the industry's \"most effective leader.\"\n\nLike GOLD, Jim Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company in its Q3 earnings call talked about guidance and future plans:\n\n\"We are expecting a further improvement in production in the fourth quarter. But as I pointed to the annual production is now expected to be marginally below the low end of the 4.2 million to 4.6 million ounce range. Copper remains on track to achieve its guidance of 420 million to 470 million pounds. As you can see here, the financial results were strong with operating cash flows growing by 35% to more than $1 billion quarter-on-quarter, free cash flow up significantly to $359 million and a 26% increase in adjusted net earnings to $0.24 per share. Barrick’s robust balance sheet secures our capacity to continue investing in our growth projects independent of the market, both new and existing, while we continue to reward our shareholders through dividends.\n\nWhile growing our business, we have also been driving a new safety culture, including a new set of standards and initiatives to keep improving this important part of our business. We call this the Journey to Zero. Sadly, this key priority was impacted by two fatalities during the quarter, which are deeply disappointing for me and the company. We remain highly motivated to achieve these Zero goals.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nIn a latest program on CNBC, while answering a question about Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA), Jim Cramer said that Moderna Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stéphane Bancel is the \"real deal.\" Cramer said that he would \"back\" Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) at the current levels.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA).\n\nEarlier this month, Goldman Sachs published a list of stocks with weak pricing power it believes can outperform. Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) made it to the list. In addition to Moderna, Jim Cramer is also bullish on  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nModerna during its Q3 earnings call talked about its guidance and future expectations:\n\nFor the U.S., we expect 2024 to be at least $2 billion and believe it will grow over time. Lastly, we expect approximately $1 billion from RSV and other international COVID sales. And finally, in 2025, we expect a return to growth. Let me finish by giving you a more fulsome view on 2024 and our thinking on 2025. Starting with 2024, as I just explained, we expect sales to be approximately $4 billion. Cost of sales are expected to be approximately 35% of sales. R&D expenses of approximately $4.5 billion in 2024, would be down 6%. In 2024, the majority of our R&D expenses are for registration trials, which are now mostly committed. I will speak to our view on 2025 R&D expenses in a moment. SG&A expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in 2024 would be down 13%.\n\nWe expect taxes to be negligible in 2024 and capital expenditures to be similar to 2023 at $0.9 billion. In summary for 2024, Spikevax will generate nearly $1 billion of income. When we combine that with our estimated investments in R&D and capital expenditures, our cash balance is projected to be approximately $9 billion at the end of 2024. Now for our preliminary thoughts on 2025. As mentioned earlier, sales will return to growth.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires 13 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now George Soros and Jim Cramer Love These Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "5 Retail Stocks to Buy on Soaring Consumer Confidence",
        "content": "Americans are a lot more optimistic about the economy’s future now as inflation continues to decline and hopes of rate cuts in the near term are high. Although inflationary pressures made life difficult for consumers last year, they have been spending quite aggressively.\n\nA steady rise in personal income helped consumers spend quite freely, which helped the retail sector overcome the challenge of rising costs last year.\n\nAs inflation started declining, consumers grew more confident and continued to spend. This saw consumer sentiment jumping to a two-and-a-half-year high in January. The University of Michigan’s preliminary index of consumer sentiment came up with a reading of 78.8 in January, surpassing both the previous month’s reading and the consensus estimate of 69.7.\n\nMore importantly, in January, the sub-index for the current economic condition increased to 83.3 from 73.3 in December. Also, the sub-index for consumer expectations rose to 75.9 in January from 67.4 in December.\n\nThe survey's gauge of one-year inflation expectations decreased to 2.9% in January from 3.1% in the previous month, marking the lowest level since December 2020.\n\nDovish comments from Federal Reserve officials after increasing interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 are also boosting consumer sentiment. The Federal Reserve has signaled that its monetary tightening campaign is nearing its end and rate cuts are on the anvil.\n\nLower interest rates will boost consumers’ sentiment further as it will allow them to spend more lavishly. Given this situation, the retail sector is poised to gain the most as consumers who have been spending cautiously over the past year will now spend more on retail.\n\nRetail sales totaled $709.9 billion, increasing 0.6% month over month in December, beating expectations of a rise of 0.4%. The unexpected jump came as inflationary worries eased, making consumers more confident about the economy’s future.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this situation, investing in retail stocks like Wingstop Inc. WING, Target Corporation TGT, Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK looks like an ideal choice.

        "title": "Warren Buffett's \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence Bets: 48.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's $365 Billion Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks",
        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett used to have a reputation for avoiding technology sector investments because of the complexities involved. On the other hand, it's probably fair to say the Oracle of Omaha changed his tune. Today, over half of Berkshire's stock portfolio is made up of technology-focused businesses. Even more striking, 48.5% of its $365 billion portfolio is actually held in just two \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nNamed for their incredible sizes, resources, and technology advantages, the Magnificent Seven is a group that includes Microsoft, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Each of these technology giants is a major player in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. But notably, only two of them have attracted investment from Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $2.96 trillion, Apple stands as the second-most-valuable publicly traded company, trailing just slightly behind Microsoft. While the iPhone maker recently lost its title as the world's largest business, it remains the largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio by far.\n\nBerkshire's last public filing showed that it owned more than 915 million shares of Apple stock. At today's prices, that position is worth over $175 billion and accounts for approximately 48% of the total stock portfolio Buffett's company owns.\n\nApple has been somewhat secretive about its AI initiatives, but it has some big advantages in the space. For starters, the tech giant has a massive base of users who love its mobile devices, computers, wearables, software, and services. The company's loyal user base love its ecosystem, and its customers also generates tons of valuable data that can be fed to AI systems.\n\nApple leads the market when it comes to smartphone unit sales in the U.S. and the world at large, a particularly impressive feat given that it typically sells hardware at higher prices than its competitors. Thanks to its incredible pricing power and the popularity of its products, the company captures roughly 85% of worldwide operating profits on smartphone sales. Apple continues to dominate the mobile market, and it's also been an early mover in the voice-based-assistant space with its Siri software.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf AI-powered personal assistants come to be a revolutionary new product category in the way some analysts and tech luminaries are predicting, Apple's user base and early mover advantages could help it be a big winner in the space. Strength in the unfolding virtual-assistant space could give way to big opportunities in online search, e-commerce, and productivity software.\n\nIn addition to virtual-assistant technologies and other AI features that will continue to evolve on its mobile and computer hardware, Apple is reportedly working on a self-driving smart car. The tech leader's incredible brand strength could make it a formidable player in the auto market. Delivering an AI-powered computing platform on wheels could have disruptive impacts across multiple industries.\n\nAs the AI revolution continues to unfold, Apple's existing strengths and penchant for delivering hugely influential products could help the stock continue to be one of Buffett's biggest winners.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns 10 million shares of Amazon stock, a position that's valued at roughly $1.5 billion. While that holding works out to just 0.4% of Berkshire's total stock portfolio, it's the only other Magnificent Seven stock the investment conglomerate owns -- and it has a range of exciting AI opportunities.\n\nWhile Amazon is best known as a market-leading e-commerce company, the large majority of its profits actually come from its cloud-infrastructure services. Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to lead the cloud computing market, and it will see rising demand as more applications are developed, launched, and scaled on its infrastructure.\n\nGenerative AI tools and features have already been rolled out on AWS and seem to be a hit with customers, and the business stands to see long-term tailwinds stemming from the development of new artificial intelligence services on its infrastructure.\n\nBut the cloud unit isn't the only Amazon business poised to benefit from AI. The tech giant has built a fast-growing digital advertising business on the foundation of its massively popular e-commerce business. The company has huge troves of data on what users of its online retail platform are interested in, and AI should continue paving the way for increasingly efficient digital ad targeting.\n\nBeyond boosting its ad business, AI also has the potential to revolutionize key facets of the company's online retail business. AI is likely to power huge increases in robotics capabilities and help Amazon unlock the untapped profit potential of its massive e-commerce business.\n\nWhile the company's online retail operations have historically generated a relatively low margin because of high costs, increased warehouse automation stands to be a major positive catalyst. The rise of AI-powered autonomous vehicles and delivery robots is also likely to increase profitability for the e-commerce business.\n\nBetween its cloud business, digital ads unit, and online retail segment, Amazon is poised to win big with AI on multiple fronts. While the tech giant occupies a relatively small position in the Berkshire portfolio, it wouldn't be surprising to see Buffett's company increase its holdings in the stock at some point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Maybe you’ve fallen for the hype and it’s time to think about which stocks to sell. It’s easy to get excited about a stock with massive potential, or one that seems like everyone is talking about. Social media and 24-hour financial news broadcasts play a part, too, in building up a hot stock.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, is real. But you can’t let the hype force trigger you to make a bad decision. If you have, you have some stocks to sell.\n\nAll too often, yesterday’s hot stock is today’s disappointment that’s doing nothing but dragging your portfolio into the red. It doesn’t take much for the shine to rub off that apple – and reveal the worm lurking underneath.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe names on this list get plenty of attention and all were high-flyers at one point. But you’ll see a more complete picture about which stocks to sell when you take the emotion out of the equation, which is exactly what the Portfolio Grader does.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader analyzes stocks based on earnings performance, revenue and profit growth, analyst sentiment, momentum and other factors. Then it assigns stocks a grade from “A” to “F” to indicate if they are good buys now or stocks to sell.\n\nThese over-hyped names most certainly fall in the latter category.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Exterior of Lucid Motors (LCID) building\n\nSource: gg5795 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of several automakers that were a hot bet just a couple of years ago to make major inroads in the electric vehicle market. LCID stock topped $55 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nToday, you can buy Lucid shares for about $3. The stock price is down 63% in the last 12 months and there’s speculation in the financial community that the company could run out of cash within a year.\n\nLast year, Lucid fell far enough to be removed from the Nasdaq 100 index. There isn’t a lot of hope that the company will turn things around this year. It produced only 2,391 vehicles in the fourth quarter, down from 3,493 a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nLCID stock gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nDrugmaker Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) was one of the hottest pharma stocks you can buy during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was one winner in the race to come up with a Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut now the U.S. government stopped paying for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, leaving it solely in the hands of insurance companies.\n\nSince only 14% of U.S. adults are believed to have gotten an updated vaccine, Pfizer’s revenues are way lower than they were just a year ago.\n\nEarnings in the third quarter were $13.2 billion, which is a lot of money. But it’s down 41% from a year ago. Pfizer posted a loss of $2.38 billion, or 42 cents per share, for the quarter.\n\nPFE stock is down 51% from its highs of two years ago. It gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nOh, my. I can’t think of any stock that’s been as over-hyped as GameStop (NYSE:GME). This company has literally been the subject of s streaming TV documentary about the retail investors on a Reddit forum that bandied together to take on short-sellers.\n\nFor a few magical days, GameStop stock actually shot to the moon. Short-seller Melvin Capital went under. But then Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), whose platform was handling many Reddit-fueled transactions, imposed trading restrictions that restricted new long positions in GME stock, and the squeeze was over.\n\nThe whole thing was ugly, running purely on emotion and excitement. But the fundamentals of GameStop never supported a higher stock price, despite the so-called “diamond hands” that the company’s fans celebrated.\n\nRevenue in the third quarter was $1.07 billion, down 9% from a year ago. The company also posted a net loss of $3.1 million or 1 cent per share.\n\nGameStop’s bulls would simply say, “I like the stock.” But the numbers don’t lie. GME stock is down 27% in the last year, getting a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nUndoubtedly, Target (NYSE:TGT) is an immensely popular retailer, boasting nearly 2,000 stores. But the shine is off Target shares, as the company’s seen a drop in shoppers.\n\nDepressed consumer spending and supply chain problems took their toll.\n\nThe stock is down 43% from its 2021 high, including 14% in the last year. Target’s best thing going for it is its dividend, which at 3.1% has increased for 53 consecutive years.\n\nBut the dividend doesn’t make up for this being an over-hyped stock. Third-quarter earnings showed revenue of $25.4 billion, down from $26.5 billion a year ago. And the fourth quarter would not get any better, with comparable sales set to decline by mid-single digits.\n\nTarget should be a better stock than it is. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNio (NIO) NIO logo, sign atop of North American headquarters and global software development center in Silicon Valley. NIO is Chinese electric autonomous vehicles manufacturer\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to talk about a disappointing Chinese stock, the conversation wouldn’t take long to turn to Nio (NYSE:NIO). The electric vehicle maker lost all the momentum it built in 2021 when shares rose from less than $10 to more than $60.\n\nNio’s returned all those gains; shares today trade for just $6, and the stock is down 50% in the last year.\n\nNio posted a net earnings loss of 4,556.7 million RMB ($624.6 million) in the third quarter. It’s making plans to spin off its battery production unit and, after doing so, will no longer control its supply chain.\n\nNio is also very dependent on China’s ailing economy. When Beijing fails to grow its GDP, or an index like the CSI 300 shows weakness, that is usually reflected in Nio stock.\n\nI used to have high hopes that Nio would be a challenger to Tesla (NASDAQ:TLSA) in China. But there are other, better Chinese EV stocks out there now, and Nio is just an over-hyped stock to sell. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nI don’t think you can call Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China any longer. While Alibaba shares some traits—it’s an e-commerce company with a cloud computing presence—Amazon has lapped BABA stock over and over in recent quarters.\n\nAlibaba’s rough road started in 2020 when Chinese regulators put the brakes on the proposed spinoff of Alibaba’s fintech unit, Ant Group. Beijing eventually issued a $2.8 billion antitrust fine.\n\nAnd then last year, Alibaba nixed its plans to spin off its cloud business, prompting more investors to dump their shares.\n\nBABA stock is down over 40% in the last year and down by over 70% since December 2020. BABA stock gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) dis stock\n\nSource: Volodymyr Plysiuk / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe House of Mouse isn’t the happiest place on Earth any longer, at least if you’re an investor. Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) used to be in the habit of printing money, but a change in leadership was traumatic.\n\nDisney fought Florida’s governor in culture wars and even its employees. ESPN’s costs soared and competition on streaming services intensified. Bob Iger hustled back to reclaim the CEO job and is trying to right the ship, but he’s reportedly planning to step aside again in 2026.\n\nThere also may be a proxy fight in the works, with Trian Fund Management and activist investor Nelson Peltz making moves within the board of directors.\n\nDIS stock is down 50% in the last two years. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Running on Empty: 3 EV Stocks to Steer Clear of in 2024",
        "content": "The Electric Vehicle industry is slowing down due to several macroeconomic conditions including high interest rates and low consumer spending. However, 2024 will see an improvement in the economy, and we could see demand pick up pace. Despite the slowdown, we have seen several companies report impressive delivery numbers, and this shows that quality EVs continue to sell, no matter the economic situation. But this is a highly competitive industry, and not all companies are meant to succeed. This has led to this list of EV stocks to sell.\n\nBefore you lose all your money, it is time to consider these three EV stocks to sell that are set to hit rock bottom in 2024.\n\nFisker (FSR) Photo of steel blue electric car being charged with wind silos and blue sky in the background. EV\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Alexander Steamaze\n\nFisker (NYSE:FSR) is one of the top EV stocks to avoid and should never be a part of your portfolio. The company has not been able to deliver on its promises and has seen several problems with Fisker Ocean. It has recently come into trouble with the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration over braking issues. This is a serious issue and not something that car owners would take lightly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFisker produced 10,000 cars last year and only delivered 4,700. It has not provided any numbers for 2024 yet. It also has a massive inventory of unsold cars from 2023 and has had to cut back on the production goals in early December. This shows that the company doesn’t believe it will be able to meet the production targets.\n\nThe management provided business updates recently and has announced a Dealership Partner model with 100 dealers, but further details are awaited. Through the new dealer initiative, the company plans to sell the inventory of 2023 before the end of this quarter.\n\nHowever, I am uncertain whether it will be able to clear the inventory when there is no demand for its cars. The overall EV demand is slow and on top of that, the demand for Fisker Ocean is minimal. If the vehicles are paid for, they might sell, but it is hard to expect new orders to come in. It aims to collect $290 million by selling the inventory which will provide enough cash to continue operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn my opinion, these are ambitious goals, and we have already seen the company over-promise and under-deliver, so it is hard to believe that these goals will turn into a reality. FSR, a penny stock trading at $0.89 is one of the top EV stocks to sell.\n\nLucid (LCID) Closeup photo of red electric vehicle being charged with blue and black charger plugged into charging port. undervalued EV stocks. Top-Rated EV Charging stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Dmytro_Yushchenko\n\nAnother stock to steer clear of in 2024 is Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID). I have already written about this in the past and I am saying this again, get rid of Lucid right away. LCID stock is already down 64% year to date, trading at $3 today, and there are little hopes of it rising.\n\nThe company failed to meet the guidance and has been burning more cash than it is generating. It used $2 billion in the first three quarters of 2023 and only had $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. However, it struggles to make the projected number of vehicles each quarter, and profitability is miles away.\n\nLucid aims to launch the Lucid Gravity by the end of the year, but considering the growing competition in the industry, the company may not receive the response it expects. Consumers already have a wide variety of options to choose from and the market is focusing on delivery numbers. Lucid is already late to the EV race, and with the amount of cash it is currently burning, it might not be able to survive for long.\n\nThe only reason Lucid has survived this long is due to the investment from the Saudi Arabian sovereign fund. With a 60% ownership stake in Lucid, Saudi Arabia aims to transition into clean energy and will open a factory for Lucid where vehicles will be produced and it has already placed an order for 100,000 cars.\n\nBut Reuters recently pointed out that Lucid could run into trouble due to the supply chain issues in Saudi Arabia since the country has already tried to attract automotive talent in the past but has failed. If the county’s EV dreams crash, Lucid will lose everything.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Illustration of blue electric vehicle (EV) charging with dark black background. EV Stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/DigitalPen\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) is another unproven EV company that might not survive for long. The company has gained a lot of enthusiasm and interest due to its Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) partnership, but we are yet to see the numbers.\n\nRivian has only generated $3.8 billion in revenue and lost $5.6 billion which shows that turning profitable or even reaching a breakeven may not happen anytime soon. RIVN stock was as high as $28 in July and has been losing value since then.\n\nThe cost of production is high, and while the losses are reducing, it will still not be able to report impressive numbers in the coming quarter. It may have enough cash for now, but the long-term picture looks blurry.\n\nIt has significant debt which leads to a high interest expense. While it produced 57,232 vehicles last year and delivered 50,122 which shows that there is demand for its vehicles but the cost of production is very high. The company will also be providing vehicles to AT&T (NYSE:T) , and this is a strong move but it is too soon to hail this move.\n\nEven if the company leverages production, I believe it will continue losing money throughout the year. Investors do not have the patience to sit and wait for it to report a profit. While the stock is trading at $16 today, sell it and take whatever money you can. I believe it is too risky to hold on to Rivian stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Amazon by 2025?",
        "content": "A few years ago, it seemed unlikely that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) could become as valuable as Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). At the beginning of 2020, Nvidia had an enterprise value of $136 billion while Amazon was worth $889 billion.\n\nBut today, Nvidia is worth $1.46 trillion and Amazon is worth $1.60 trillion. Both of those tech giants kept growing over the past four years, but Nvidia closed in on Amazon as the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market lit a raging fire under its data center business.\n\nCould this red-hot chipmaker actually overtake the e-commerce and cloud leader by 2025? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow rapidly did Nvidia grow over the past few years?\n\nNvidia's revenue declined 7% in fiscal 2020, which ended in January 2020, as it struggled with the slower growth of the PC gaming market, the decline of cryptocurrency prices -- which drove miners to flood the market with secondhand GPUs -- and supply chain disruptions caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut in fiscal 2021, its revenue surged 53% as the gaming and AI markets heated up again. That growth continued over the following year and its revenue soared 61% in fiscal 2022.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, its revenue growth flatlined as PC sales dropped in a post-pandemic market and the macro headwinds forced data center operators to rein in their spending. By the end of the year, many analysts expected Nvidia's revenue to grow only about 10% in fiscal 2024. However, those conservative forecasts didn't account for the explosive growth of the generative AI market over the past year -- which drove many companies to accumulate Nvidia's top-tier data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks. That's why the same analysts now expect Nvidia's revenue to soar 119% to $59.1 billion in fiscal 2024 (which finalizes at the end of this month).\n\nIf Nvidia matches that target, it will have grown its annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 52.5% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2024. Amazon is expected to grow its revenue at a CAGR of 19.4% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon also experienced a boom and bust cycle over the past four years. Its growth initially accelerated during the pandemic as more people shopped online and companies ramped up their spending on cloud-based services, but it slowed down as those tailwinds dissipated. Inflation and rising interest rates exacerbated that slowdown -- but its core e-commerce and cloud businesses have gradually stabilized over the past year.\n\nNvidia could keep growing faster than Amazon\n\nThe bulls believe Nvidia's sales will keep soaring as it sells more data center chips, which made up 80% of its revenue in its latest quarter, and its gaming business grows again. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 36% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026 as the AI market continues to expand. They also expect its EPS to grow at a CAGR of 38%.\n\nWe should take those estimates with a grain of salt since those analysts were largely blindsided by the generative AI boom, but the long-term forecasts for the AI industry reinforce that bullish outlook. The broader AI market could grow at a CAGR of 19% from 2023 to 2032, according to Precedence Research, while Fortune Business Insights believes the generative AI niche will expand at an even faster CAGR of 47.5%.\n\nNvidia's stock isn't cheap at 33 times next year's earnings, but its dominance of the growing data center and gaming GPU markets could justify that higher valuation. But Nvidia still needs to overcome some unpredictable challenges, including the latest export curbs on advanced AI chips to China; the development of first-party AI chips by major customers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI; and a potential supply glut caused by companies accumulating too many data center GPUs.\n\nYet Nvidia could still grow faster than Amazon, which is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at a CAGR of 12% and 34%, respectively, from 2023 to 2025. And at 43 times next year's earnings, Amazon's stock still looks pricier than Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia could be worth more than Amazon by 2025\n\nBased on all these facts, Nvidia could easily become more valuable than Amazon by the end of 2025. Its stock would only need to rise about 10% from its current levels to lift its enterprise value past Amazon's, and it could continue to outperform the e-commerce and cloud leader over the next two years as the AI market continues growing.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.\n\nGrowth stocks have rewarded investors over the past several years, thanks to the hyper growth and mind-numbing expansion of technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Data from the CFA Institute showed that since the end of the financial crisis, growth stocks outperformed value stocks by 144% through June 2018. The study highlighted that this massive outperformance was not a \"fluke\" since most of the growth stocks studied were trading at decent valuation multiples during 2009 and they also saw earnings growth during the period which was analyzed in the study.\n\nIn theory, growth stocks tend to underperform during a high interest rate environment when investors turn to realistic valuations and move away from risky assets. But what happened last year was the opposite of this. That means Mr. Market really cares about AI and the impact it is creating. That's why investors are still happy to buy technology stocks trading at higher multiples. Many analysts believe we are going through the beginning of the AI revolution and the AI products and services mega-cap technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making will have far-reaching consequences on human progress.\n\nCan Growth Stocks Continue to Outperform in 2024?\n\nFinancial markets defied all expectations last year and avoided the much-feared recession. But will the AI-related euphoria and economic resilience help the stock market this year? UBS said in its 2024 market outlook report that it would be \"historically unusual\" if the US economy ends up avoiding recession after the rate hikes of 2022 and 2023. But the report said there is a reason for optimism this time as UBS expects no significant economic contraction in 2024 even though it sees a slowdown in growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Invest in Quality Stocks with Higher Multiples?\n\nIn this environment, UBS recommended investors to pile into quality stocks. The firm said quality stocks can have higher valuations on a relative basis but it said quality stocks would be worth paying for this year.\n\n\"Quality stocks have historically outperformed in the late stages of the business cycle, including in periods of economic contraction, which should offer portfolio protection if the economy slows more than we expect. The quality tilt also aligns with our preference for US technology companies, which should be among the key beneficiaries of AI-related demand for both hardware and software. Quality stocks typically have higher valuations than the overall index, but we think that quality is worth paying for in 2024. Investors can find quality stocks within US tech; stable quality-income and high-quality cyclical stocks in Europe; and in select names in Asia.\" Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to see which stocks with extreme revenue growth are on the radar of billionaire investors.  For this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with EPS growth of over 30% over the past five years, sales growth of over 25% over the past five years and quarter-over-quarter sales growth of over 25% posted in the most recent quarters. From these stocks we selected 11 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. To find the number of billionaire investors for these stocks we used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of billionaire investors and their stock holdings. Why care about billionaires and hedge fund managers?

        "title": "Alibaba Stock (NYSE:BABA): Wait Until Earnings, but Be Ready",
        "content": "If any Wall Street-listed company represents the ups and downs of China’s economy, it would be Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). You may be ready to load up on Alibaba shares right now, especially if you’re optimistic that China will turn a corner this year. For the very long term, I am bullish on BABA stock, but today, I’m providing a cautionary note due to an imminent make-or-break event.\n\nAlibaba is basically the Chinese counterpart to America’s Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Like Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba is an e-commerce giant in China that is also successful in market niches outside of e-commerce.\n\nMaybe China is on the cusp of an economic comeback of epic proportions; it’s hard to know for sure. Nevertheless, if Alibaba posts positive numbers and provides encouraging guidance in an upcoming earnings report, the bull case for BABA stock could be practically unassailable.\n\nIs Alibaba Stock Too Cheap to Ignore?\n\nFirst and foremost, I should address an eyebrow-raising comment made by a highly respected analyst firm. Specifically, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analysts reportedly went so far as to declare that Alibaba stock is “too cheap to ignore.”\n\nCertainly, it’s hard to argue with the “cheap” designation. While American technology stocks soared last year, BABA stock foundered like a sinking ship. Hence, if you truly believe in buying low and selling high, investing in Alibaba should make perfect sense.\n\nApplying traditional valuation metrics seems to support this point. Alibaba’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6x is undoubtedly more appealing than the sector median P/E ratio of 17.51x.\n\nBarclays analyst Jiong Shao also considered Alibaba’s valuation. Observing that Alibaba has generated $27 billion in free cash flow in the last 12 months, Shao assessed Alibaba’s valuation as “among the most compelling.” Furthermore, Shao believes that BABA stock “screens as the cheapest major tech stock globally” and assigned it an Overweight rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn case that’s not enough motivation for you, here’s another piece of notable news. Apparently, there’s been some serious insider buying going on at Alibaba. In particular, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma reportedly purchased $50 million worth of the company’s shares.\n\nNot only that, but Alibaba Chairman reportedly bought $151 million worth of BABA stock shares in last year’s fourth quarter. That’s a sure sign of confidence among two Alibaba insiders with deep knowledge about the company.\n\nTraders are Excited About Alibaba, but be Careful Now\n\nExcitement over Chinese tech-related stocks building, but does this mean you have to invest in Alibaba right now? Not necessarily, as waiting could be the most prudent policy.\n\nThe excitement isn’t limited to Alibaba but really pertains to Chinese businesses generally. That’s because China’s central bank plans to add $139 billion worth of long-term liquidity to the nation’s economy by reducing the cash reserve ratio for banks. Moreover, Chinese authorities are reportedly looking at a massive $278 billion rescue/bailout/stabilization package.\n\nConsequently, stock traders recently gobbled up shares of Alibaba stock and other China-associated tech stocks. Thus, in the short term, it might be claimed that the forceful measures of China’s central bank have been successful.\n\nOn the other hand, it’s too early to simply declare victory and assume that Chinese stocks will continue higher throughout the year. Government intervention in the economy and markets isn’t always the ideal solution to a crashing stock market. For instance, you may recall the time when Chinese authorities restricted short selling in order to prop up the nation’s stock market. This tactic didn’t work well in the long run.\n\nWhether China’s government intervention succeeds in supporting the country’s economy and markets remains to be seen. One could certainly argue that the U.S. stock market has benefited whenever the Federal Reserve pumped liquidity into the banking system. So, maybe this strategy will work in China, with positive ramifications for Alibaba.\n\nThat said, it’s probably not an ideal time to jump right into BABA stock. Alibaba has a crucially important earnings report coming up on January 31. It would be quite disappointing if the company breaks its excellent track record of consecutive EPS forecast beats.\n\nThe stakes are high, and so are the expectations. Wall Street anticipates that Alibaba will report EPS of $2.73 for the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. That’s higher than any quarterly EPS forecast in recent history for Alibaba. Could a major letdown be in store?\n\nIs BABA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, BABA comes in as a Strong Buy based on 18 Buys and two Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Alibaba stock price target is $118.60, implying % upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell BABA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Rob Sanderson of Loop Capital Markets, with an average return of 11.74% per rating and a 52% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider BABA Stock?\n\nI’m bullish on Alibaba’s growth prospects, but only for the very long term. For the immediate term, there’s uncertainty regarding China’s intervention as well as Alibaba’s imminent earnings results. Therefore, I feel that waiting for a little while longer is a sensible policy. Even if Alibaba has the potential to stage an epic comeback in 2024, right now, I’m not ready to consider a share position in BABA stock.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "7 Tech Stocks That Also Bring in Attractive Passive Income",
        "content": "When the topic of tech stocks comes up, chances are, you’re not really thinking about any underlying dividends. Instead, the top innovators generally tend to be capital-gains-oriented investments. Usually, that’s by design. Companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) need to constantly reinvest their earnings into the business for future advancements or expansions.\n\nStill, not all tech stocks abide by the principle of growth at all costs. Many choose to reward their shareholders with passive income. Both sides have their pros and cons. That said, during a time when innovators already enjoyed explosive growth in the prior year, it may be better to focus on consistently profitable entities that provide dividends.\n\nIn other words, it could make sense to rotate into risk-mitigated investments while still being exposed to top-tier technical advancements. On that note, below are tech stocks to buy for passive income.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNXP Semiconductors (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Dutch semiconductor designer and manufacturer, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) specializes in processors and microcontrollers used in various connected systems. These products cover applications used in various industries, including automotive, consumer electronics and automation. For investors, the beauty of NXPI is that it performed decently well in the past year but it still lags the broader tech index.\n\nFrom a contrarian standpoint, that makes NXPI one of the tech stocks to buy for passive income. For those seeking capital gains, the global microcontroller market reached a valuation of $32.37 billion last year. Experts project that the segment may expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.6% by 2030. If so, the growth will culminate in sector revenue of $69.87 billion.\n\nAnd that’s just one area of NXP’s business. On the passive income front, the company offers a forward yield of 1.85%. While not overwhelmingly generous, the payout ratio sits at 25.27%, implying little concern about yield sustainability. Thus, it’s one of the tech stocks to buy for passive income.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) plays a critical role in the global computer chip value chain. Per its public profile, TSMC represents the world’s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry. If you want to know why geopolitical news in the surrounding region is such a hot topic, just look at TSM. It’s one of the tech stocks that if it goes down, it could take down the world economy.\n\nOf course, there’s a much more positive, encouraging reason to consider TSMC: a viable candidate for tech stocks to buy for passive income. First, the company fabricates chips for leading-edge technology companies that have become household names. Second, the global semiconductor foundry business can expand at a respectable 8.1% CAGR to hit $231.5 billion by 2032. You certainly don’t want to ignore this super-relevant enterprise.\n\nCurrently, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 1.92%. Again, it’s not the most generous deal out there. However, the payout ratio sits at 28.97%. With a strong earnings report in hand, TSM is worth consideration among tech stocks.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top-tier innovator primarily in the wireless communications ecosystem, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) creates various sector-related semiconductors, software, and services. It owns patents that cover a broad range of mobile communications standards. Over the past one-year period, it has performed decently well. However, it’s really come alive in late October. Better yet, it’s been carrying the momentum into 2024.\n\nFundamentally, the beauty of Qualcomm is that it enjoys multiple avenues to explore. Further, each one of these avenues offers tremendous growth. For example, the global 5G services market size reached a valuation of $84.31 billion last year. And experts project that the segment could see expansion to the tune of a 59.4% CAGR. If so, we’re talking about sector revenue of over $2.2 trillion by 2030.\n\nRegarding dividends, Qualcomm carries a forward yield of 2.09%. That’s notably better than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. What’s more, the payout ratio sits at just under 30%, a very sustainable figure. Therefore, it’s one of the tech stocks to buy for passive income.\n\nBenchmark Electronics (BHE) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nBased in Tempe, Arizona, Benchmark Electronics (NYSE:BHE) provides contract manufacturing services for various electronic devices and systems. These services cover multiple sectors and applications, including aerospace, medical, communications and complex industrials. It’s a quiet enterprise, posting a rather unimpressive performance in 2023 if we’re being perfectly honest. Still, rising relevancies could make BHE one of the tech stocks to buy for passive income.\n\nBenchmark falls under the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) industry. That’s significant because the segment may reach a valuation of $580.52 billion by year’s end. Further, experts believe the space could reach $773.22 billion by 2029. If so, that would translate to a CAGR of 5.9%. It may be a slower growth segment of the wider tech ecosystem. Still, its importance should keep the lights on at Benchmark.\n\nPlus, patient investors can benefit from the forward dividend yield of 2.48%. Enticingly, the payout ratio sits at 21.78%, providing investors with confidence regarding yield sustainability. Also, Lake Street sees BHE as a “buy” with a $29 price target.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Image of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's building\n\nSource: zakiahza / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving over to the higher-risk, higher-(passive)-reward segment of tech stocks, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is a multinational information technology (IT) company. Based in Spring, Texas, Hewlett Packard focuses on servers, storage, networking, containerization software and consulting and support. As with Benchmark above, HPE’s 52-week performance is – to put it diplomatically – unremarkable. Still, it could potentially deliver the goods this year.\n\nWith the usual suspects hogging up the spotlight, HPE sits in the background. That makes it an intriguing contrarian play. More importantly, the global data center market – which HPE addresses via its servers – reached a valuation of $194.81 billion in 2022. Experts anticipate that the sector could expand at a CAGR of 10.9% from 2023 to 2030. If so, we’re talking about sector revenue of $437.33 billion.\n\nIn terms of dividends, Hewlett Packard offers a forward yield of 3.35%. Not only is that generous, the payout ratio sits at 24.46%, providing investors with confidence. Thus, it’s an intriguing idea for tech stocks to buy for passive income.\n\nAmerican Software (AMSWA) Man in a server room holding a laptop\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a business world that has seemingly gone extremist in the use of word salad, I really appreciate American Software (NASDAQ:AMSWA). Unlike other companies that almost appear to be in the business of confusing investors and analysts alike, American Software is direct and to the point: it provides “demand-driven supply chain management and enterprise software solutions backed by more than 45 years of industry experience.” Boom! No more explanation necessary.\n\nLet’s look at this matter objectively. According to Grand View Research, the global supply chain management (SCM) market size reached a value of $21.13 billion in 2022. Further, experts anticipate that the segment could expand at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2023 to 2030. At the culmination point, total industry revenue should reach around $48.59 billion. Undergirding demand is a broader realization of the benefits of SCM protocols.\n\nTurning to the dividends, American Software offers a forward yield of 3.7%. To be fair, the payout ratio is elevated at 78.97%. However, the company benefits from consistent profitability. As well, analysts peg shares a unanimous strong buy with a $16 average price target. That all makes for a compelling case for tech stocks to buy for passive income.\n\nInformation Services (III) Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background. Trade, finance, technology and communication concept. 3D Rendering. Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market Returns. Tech Stocks to buy\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving from clear descriptions to more opaque verbiage, Information Services (NASDAQ:III) bills itself as a leading global technology research and advisory firm. Its website then goes on to talk about clients, vision, rapid changes, and digital investments among other buzzwords. Digging into the thick foliage of word salad, it seems Information Services is in the business of providing information technology (IT) consulting and business process outsourcing (BPO) services.\n\nOkay, so, III makes a compelling play for both tech stocks to buy for passive income and capital gains. According to Grand View Research, the global BPO market reached a valuation of $261.9 billion in 2022. Experts anticipate that the sector could expand at a CAGR of 9.4% from 2023 to 2030. At the end of the forecast, total industry revenue could be $525.2 billion.\n\nEnticingly, III features a market capitalization of only $219 million. In theory, blue skies lie waiting.\n\nLooking at the dividend front, the company carries a forward yield of 4.02%. Further, the payout ratio is quite reasonable at 40%. Adding to the tempting profile, III trades at only 8.94X forward earnings, lower than the sector median 24X.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Famous investors such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch agree that you only need to hit homeruns with one or two stocks to make a lot of money. A single stock can make an investor’s career and lead them to riches. These are often referred to as compounders, stocks that consistently beat the market over many years, driven higher by incredible earnings growth and profitability. Consider that $10,000 invested in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on the day that it held its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997 would be worth more than $16 million today, and it gives you a sense of the impact that one well-placed investment decision can have on a person’s life. The good news is that there are many stocks today that are compounders and whose growth is crushing the broader market. Here are three growth stocks to turn $100,000 into $1 million: January 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe stock of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is defying the laws of gravity. The company, which makes high-efficiency computer servers, is the hottest thing in the market right now. Three weeks into the new year, and SMCI stock is up 58%. That brings its gain over the last 12 months to 510%, more than double the growth in the stock of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with which it has a partnership. Through five years, SMCI stock is up an astounding 2,900%.\n\nIf any stock can help investors turn $100,000 into $1 million, it is Super Micro Computer. The company’s share price has been surging ever since it announced a partnership with Nvidia last year. More recently, the company pre-announced better-than-expected financial results and raised its forward guidance on growing demand for its servers, which is being driven by the boom in artificial intelligence (AI). Of course there’s a risk anytime a stock runs this hot. But, right now, SMCI stock looks unstoppable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother stock that continues to enjoy impressive growth is software company Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG). The company’s shares rose 28% in a single trading session late last year after it reported better-than-expected third-quarter financial results and raised its full-year guidance. So far in 2024, DDOG stock has added another 13%, bringing its 12-month return to 72%. Since going public in 2019, the company’s share price has more than tripled.\n\nDatadog, whose software is used in cloud computing, most recently reported earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents, beating consensus forecasts of 34 cents. Revenue during Q3 came in at $547.5 million, up 25% from a year earlier and beating Wall Street estimates that called for sales of $524.1 million. Datadog also raised its full-year guidance, saying it expects Q4 revenue of $564 million to $568 million, and full-year revenue of $2.1 billion. Both figures exceeded consensus analyst forecasts.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother area of the market that continues to be hot is cybersecurity. And leading the pack of cybersecurity stocks is Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). So far in 2024, PANW has risen 20%, bringing its 12-month gain to 130%. In the last five years, the company’s share price has climbed nearly 400%, making it a strong growth stock and one to turn $100,000 into $1 million. Like Super Micro Computer and Datadog, PANW stock has been supercharged by earnings in recent quarters.\n\nIn November, Palo Alto Networks reported EPS of $1.38, which was better than the $1.16 forecast among analysts. Revenue in the quarter amounted to $1.88 billion, up 20% from a year ago and above Wall Street forecasts of 1.84 billion. Looking ahead, Palo Alto Networks forecast revenue of $1.955 billion to $1.985 billion, in line with analyst views for $1.97 billion of revenue for the current first quarter of 2024. The company sees profit for Q1 2024 of $1.29 to $1.31 a share, above consensus estimates of $1.25.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Ring home doorbell unit says it will stop letting police departments request footage from users’ video doorbells and surveillance cameras, retreating from a practice that was criticized by civil liberties groups and some elected officials.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Says Ukraine Downed Plane Carrying Prisoners for Swap Trump Races Toward 2024 Biden Rematch After New Hampshire Win Apple Dials Back Car’s Self-Driving Features and Delays Launch to 2028 Billionaire Joe Lewis Pleads Guilty in Insider Trading Case China Boosts Stimulus by Allowing Banks to Keep Smaller Reserves\n\nNext week, the company will disable its Request For Assistance tool, the program that had allowed law enforcement to seek footage from users on a voluntary basis, Eric Kuhn, who runs Ring’s Neighbors app, said in a blog post on Wednesday. Police and fire departments will have to seek a warrant to request footage from users or show the company evidence of an ongoing emergency.\n\nKuhn didn’t say why Ring was disabling the tool. Yassi Yarger, a spokesperson, said Ring had decided to devote its resources to new products and experiences in the Neighbors app that better fit with the company’s vision. The aim is to make Neighbors, which had been focused on crime and safety, into more of a community hub, she said. New features announced on Wednesday – one called Ring Moments that lets users post clips and a company-produced Best of Ring – highlight that push.\n\nThe move marks a course change for Ring, which from its startup days through its years as part of Amazon couched its mission almost exclusively as an effort to improve public safety through surveillance. “Our mission to reduce crime in neighborhoods has been at the core of everything we do at Ring,” founding chief Jamie Siminoff said when Amazon sealed the acquisition of his company in 2018.\n\nAmazon joins Google in paring back law-enforcement access to its users. The Alphabet Inc.-owned company last month said it was changing its location history feature on Google Maps, eliminating the ability of police to request data on everyone in the vicinity of a crime. Grabbing user data from Google had become an increasingly popular route for police departments, a Bloomberg investigation found.\n\nStory continues\n\nCivil liberties groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have long criticized Ring, accusing it of building a residential surveillance network available on demand to law enforcement and highlighting the history of biased policing in the US.\n\n“This is a step in the right direction but has come after years of cozy relationships with police and irresponsible handling of data,” said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst with EFF. Amazon last year agreed to pay $5.8 million to settle a complaint brought by the US Federal Trade Commission accusing Ring of privacy and data security lapses.\n\nGuariglia said in an email that he was skeptical that Ring and law enforcement could correctly assess what constitutes an emergency situation, and noted that police could still seek Ring footage without a warrant by knocking on someone’s door.\n\nInitially, when police departments sought footage from Ring doorbell owners in a particular area during an investigation, the company would email users and ask them to voluntarily share clips. Ring in 2021 began requiring police and fire departments to make those requests publicly through its Neighbors app, a Nextdoor-like hub that lets people upload footage and share information. That didn’t defuse the critiques, including from Senator Ed Markey, who lambasted the “growing web of surveillance systems” built by Amazon and other technology firms.\n\nSiminoff left Ring last year. He was replaced as chief executive officer by Liz Hamren, who had worked at Discord Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. Hamren told Bloomberg last year that Ring was rethinking its mission statement, in part to account for its expanded portfolio of devices, which include indoor and backyard home monitoring and business services.\n\n(Updates with comment from civil liberties group, FTC privacy settlement, beginning in the seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors Hong Kong’s High Rents Create a New Type of Cross-Border Commuter It’s the Tesla Earnings Call—Time for Elon Musk Bingo Can America’s New Union Hero Take on Elon Musk’s Tesla?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In a recent interview, Amazon.com, Inc. Founder Jeff Bezos engaged in a thoughtful conversation with Russian computer scientist Lex Fridman, sharing intriguing personal insights into artificial intelligence (AI). Bezos referred to generative AI tools such as ChatGPT as “not inventions, they’re discoveries ... we’re constantly getting surprised by their capabilities.”\n\n\"These powerful tools are much more likely to help us and save us even than they are to unbalance, hurt us, and destroy us,\" he said.\n\nIn a significant move within the AI landscape, the tech giant introduced Amazon Q in November, signaling a substantial leap in revolutionizing business support. Operating under the Amazon Web Services (AWS) umbrella, Amazon Q aims to augment tasks, expedite decision-making processes and stimulate creativity by providing prompt and pertinent information and advice to employees.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch? Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\n\nOne of the key differentiators between Q and its competitors is its business-centered focus and integration with top business-to-business (B2B) companies. According to AWS CEO Adam Selipsky, Amazon Q can be seamlessly integrated with software such as Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google, Slack and 40 more companies. It can extract and understand \"the concepts, product names, organization structure ... all the details that make up your business.\"\n\nAmazon has been trying hard to get into the artificial intelligence space alongside other tech giants. Last year, Amazon invested up to $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI employees. Anthropic also raised $2 billion from Google parent Alphabet, Inc.\n\nThe launch of Amazon Q has not gone unnoticed in the market. It's reflected in Amazon's stock price, which has increased by 5.58% since Nov. 28.\n\nDespite Amazon entering the AI space later than its competitors, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, and having more time to create and build its AI models, Amazon's Q has encountered challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: How to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024? These investors have the latest tips.\n\nAt the time of its launch, Amazon commented, “AWS never uses customers' content from Amazon Q to train the underlying models, ensuring the security and privacy of company information,” but recent user reports suggest a different narrative. Instances of Amazon Q allegedly hallucinating and leaking private information have surfaced, prompting concerns and casting doubts on the platform’s security measures.\n\nBezos, however, remains optimistic about the impact of AI, expressing his belief that these powerful tools are more likely to assist and benefit humanity than to pose a threat. He emphasizes their potential to save and uplift us rather than unbalance or harm us. Putting it into perspective, Bezos said, \"You know, the telescope was an invention, but looking through it at Jupiter knowing that it had moons was a discovery.\"\n\nWhile the platform has garnered attention for its integration capabilities and potential to revolutionize interactions with various software, the reported concerns about security and privacy raise important questions about its reliability. Bezos’s optimism about the positive impact of AI on humanity contrasts with the challenges Amazon Q faces, highlighting the ongoing complexities in the development and deployment of advanced AI technologies. As the tech giant navigates these challenges, the future trajectory of Amazon Q and its role in shaping the AI landscape remains a subject of keen interest and scrutiny.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHedge funds intend to snatch all pre-IPO shares of future AI unicorns before you can.

        "content": "Entering a bull market wasn’t a linear journey. With the market shift from a 2022 bear market, where safer stocks gained favor, to 2023’s confidence, it prompted a return to growth stocks.\n\nDespite the S&P 500‘s 23% surge, some 2022 gainers declined in 2023. S&P 500 Pure Value rose 5%, while Nasdaq-100 tech jumped 52%. Amid the five-year market volatility and 2022’s macroeconomic challenges causing sell-offs, many prominent tech stock shares remain resilient and appealing for long-term investments.\n\nLet’s examine three stocks that investors should buy and hold for the next five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the last two decades, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) evolved from a small online bookstore to dominate e-commerce, expanding its product range through Amazon Marketplace. Introducing services like Amazon Prime, it then ventured into cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It sustained impressive growth and became a preferred provider in the commercial sector.\n\nDespite Amazon’s massive size limiting historical growth rates, it holds strong growth potential. In e-commerce, with a 38% U.S. market share and low overall retail share, expansion abounds, especially in India’s emerging market. The cloud computing industry benefits from ongoing cloud migration and AI advancements.\n\nAmazon experienced double-digit sales growth, recording impressive 13% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q3 2023. Profits surged, with operating income quadrupling and net income tripling to $9.9 billion. The company’s commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction fosters a culture of experimentation. Additionally, it positions it well for sustained growth and adaptation to future trends.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2023, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) prioritized efficiency. Accordingly, 2024 presents opportunities for remarkable growth. Despite the stock’s surge, positive catalysts suggest further improvement and strong sales growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta faces a major risk in 2024 – the prospect of a U.S. recession, albeit mild. Various metrics signal challenges for the company, given its reliance on advertising revenue. Recessions, typically short-lived, do pose threats. However, Meta’s dominant social media presence remains a strength, as the company attracts more users and enhances its advertising pricing power.\n\nMeta Platforms is nearing the $1 trillion market capitalization level, surging 200% in 2023. The company’s current market cap of more than $980 billion could easily reach this threshold in short order. If Meta rejoins the trillion-dollar club, and the stock trends toward new all-time highs, investors will be increasingly focused on forward-looking growth projections. At least for now, I expect projections to increase, due to the strong fundamentals of this company’s core business.\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.\n\nSource: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanadian-based fast food giant Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), with brands like Burger King and Tim Hortons, reported robust Q2 FY2023 results.\n\nThe company yields 9.6% growth in comparable sales and increased EBITDA surged from $618 million in 2022 to $665 million in 2023. Importantly, QSR stock offers a 2.9% forward dividend yield, providing steady income via consistent dividend payments over the last five years.\n\nIn recent news, Restaurant Brands and Carrols Restaurant Group announced a deal. RBI will acquire all outstanding Carrols shares for $9.55 each in an all-cash transaction, valuing Carrols at approximately $1 billion. This represents a 23.1% premium to Carrols’ 30-day average price.\n\nTom Curtis, President of Burger King U.S. and Canada, expressed enthusiasm about acquiring Carrols. He aims to enhance guest experiences through rapid restaurant remodeling. Deborah Derby, Carrols’ President and CEO, highlighted the transaction’s immediate value for shareholders and growth opportunities for team members within Restaurant Brands.\n\nFor long-term investors betting on continued innovation and growth with this company, Restaurant Brands is positioned well for the next five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) announced on Wednesday that it is teaming up with some of the biggest names in tech to launch the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot program.\n\nThe NAIRR pilot, the NSF said, is designed to create a national resource for researchers and educators to access high-powered AI technologies with the goal of ensuring the US continues to lead in AI research and innovation.\n\nCompanies and nonprofits joining in the two-year pilot program consist of a murderers' row of some of the biggest names in AI, including Amazon (AMZN), Anthropic, Hugging Face, IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), OpenAI, and Palantir (PLTR), among others.\n\nFederal agencies participating in the effort include the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Agriculture.\n\nNAIRR, which was born out of President Biden’s AI executive order, will serve as a framework for how the government and private sector can advance AI technologies in the future. Nvidia is among a collection of companies providing the National Science Foundation with help for its National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource, or NAIRR, program. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“By investing in AI research through the NAIRR pilot, the United States unleashes discovery and impact and bolsters its global competitiveness,” NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement.\n\n“To continue leading in AI research and development, we must create opportunities across the country to advance AI innovation and strengthen educational opportunities, empowering the nation to shape international standards and igniting economic growth,” he added.\n\nAccording to the NSF, NAIRR will function as a shared national infrastructure that will provide communities across the country with the hardware, models, and resources needed to advance the AI ecosystem.\n\nThe program, the NSF said, is necessary because AI resources have become concentrated and difficult to access for many communities, whether those are smaller colleges or institutions in rural areas and territories.\n\nStory continues Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nExamples of potential use cases include allowing an AI researcher to investigate the validation and verification of large models or a lecturer from a community college or minority institution to provide students access to AI systems.\n\nTech companies, the foundation explained, aren’t being paid to provide access to their services, but rather are making in-kind contributions to those made by government agencies.\n\nContributions include support for 20 research projects by Amazon, access to Anthropic’s Claude model for 10 researchers working on climate change projects, 100 compute grants from Hugging Face, datasets and benchmarks from IBM, $20 million in compute credits for Microsoft’s Azure, and $30 million in support from Nvidia, including $24 million worth of computing for the company’s DGX platform.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Apple AAPL has emerged as a major player in the movie industry thanks to impressive content. It recently won a record 13 Academy Award nominations, including ten for Killers of the Flower Moon.\r\n\r\nThe Martin Scorsese directorial was the first Apple Original Films release to have a wider theatrical run, garnering roughly $150 million in global box office sales.\r\n\r\nKillers of the Flower Moon has garnered nominations across multiple categories, including Best Picture, Best Director and a historic nomination for Best Actress for Lily Gladstone, who has become the first Native American to be recognized in this category.\r\n\r\nThe movie, set in the world of the Osage Nation, also earned nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography.\r\n\r\nIndigenous artists Robbie Robertson and Scott George have also made history with their first-ever nominations in the Best Original Score and Best Original Song categories, respectively.

Since its launch just over four years ago, Apple has become one of the most-nominated studios for this year's Oscars.\r\n\r\nThe historic nominations for Killers of the Flower Moon follow Apple's notable wins at the 2022 Academy Awards with CODA, making history as the first motion picture starring a predominantly deaf cast in leading roles to win Best Picture.

        "title": "EBay's Business Model: Value Play or Value Trap?",
        "content": "Global e-commerce auctioneer eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) has outperformed earnings expectations for seven out of eight consecutive quarters according to MarketBeat. The stock is selling at an attractive low multiple of less than 8 times earnings compared to a global average of over 17 times for the retail cyclical industry. GuruFocus gives the company a GF Score of 88 and a target share price of $57.51, a 29% increase over the current share price as of this writing.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with EBAY.\n\nEBay's trailing 12-month operating margin is over 7 times that of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its ROE is 50%. However, industry analysts are lukewarm on the stock with an overall hold consensus, citing uphill battles against e-retail gargantuans Amazon, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), all of which are well positioned to capture market share.\n\nThis discussion will give a history of the adherence to the strategy that has given eBay good returns and the ability to continue its reign as the premier global e-auctioneer in a sea of e-retailers, including huge, formidable competitors like Amazon, Alibaba, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Walmart. I will also give a brief perspective of why the stock has such cool analyst and investor sentiment.\n\nPlease note that I am not a financial advisor, and this article is intended only for informative purposes.\n\nEBay margins compared to those of competitors (TTM ending of 09/30/2023)\n\nCompany EBAY AMZN WMT BABA JD ETSY Gross Margin 72.13% 46.24% 24.27% 37.61% 14.69% 70.56% Operating Margin 20.83% 4.76% 3.96% 13.81% 2.68% 11.19% Profit Margin 26.99% 3.62% 2.55% 14.47% 2.22% 12.30% Free Cash Flow Margin 24.90% 3.87% 2.02% 19.63% 3.47% 24.90%\n\nE-eommerce retail and online auctions\n\nEBay is part of the highly competitive e-commerce retail industry. Its particular focus is online auctions or re-commerce as commonly known in the online retail and auction communities. The company's e-commerce retail categories consist of primarily business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer merchandise versus the larger e-commerce environment that also involves business-to-business and business-to-government merchandise and transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompared to traditional brick-and-mortar stores, online retailers traditionally have lower start-up costs and capital expenditures that remove barriers to entry and increase competition. Disadvantages include the reliance on hosting providers and the threat of lost revenue or income when websites crash.\n\nThe global e-commerce market is expected to reach $6.7 trillion this year according to a report by Research and Markets. The online auction component of the global e-commerce market has an estimated compound annual growth rate of 12.36% until 2028. EBay is the dominant player in this space.\n\nFocused business model\n\nEBay's mission is to connect people and build communities to create economic opportunity for all.\n\nIts main business model revolves around providing marketplaces for third-party sellers and primarily business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer customers. The company makes money mainly through listing, transaction and advertising fees and takes no inventory. Even parts of its fulfillment process is managed by third-party partners. This allows the company to keep overhead lower than that of its competitors. This model has been robust enough to allow eBay to establish a first-mover advantage, expand globally and develop into a household name.\n\nThe company also takes great measures to create a network of loyal users by honing a community environment that targets small business and entrepreneurial sellers and value-oriented buyers and collectors. Operating expenditures are devoted to beefing up fraud detection and developing infrastructure and easy-to-use tools to facilitate user transactions and communication.\n\nThe industry shake-out after the dotcom bust was pivotable for eBay. Competition in the e-retail space, propelled solely by venture funding, quickly evaporated when funds dried up. Even Amazon, with its go-large growth philosophy during the late 90's, had not achieved profitability by 2000 and almost collapsed. In contrast, eBay, with a streamlined business model, had achieved solid profits by that time. Also, its established B2C and C2C buyer and seller community and its market for used merchandise appealed to consumers in uncertain times and gave the company remarkable resiliency.\n\nAlthough business model adherence has been strong throughout its history, eBay has made some miscalculations. The company has segued into other e-commerce and auction offerings that have deviated somewhat from its main strategy, including big-ticket items, classified and listing services and e-commerce site development services for brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nProblematic acquisitions, partnerships and diversions\n\nPart of eBay's growth strategy is through company acquisitions. The company has made over 70 acquisitions throughout its lifetime. Generally, these acquisitions have been well-intended and have been focused on obtaining synergies for the company, but not all have been congruent with eBay's overall business strategy or have been easily assimilated into eBay's corporate culture.\n\nOffline sales of big-ticket items\n\nIn 1999, eBay acquired Butterfield & Butterfield to foray into big-ticket collectibles. The company also hoped to benefit from Butterfield's appraisal and authentication services. However, customers were reluctant to purchase big-ticket items online and the softened economy in 2000 had reduced the demand for luxury items. The company sold Butterfields to Bonhams in 2002 for an undisclosed amount that analysts estimated was far below the initial purchase price. At that time, approximately 70% of Butterfield's transactions occurred offline.\n\nEBay also purchased Kruse International, which specialized in collector automobile auctions. Kruse International was an additional effort to reach the market for high-end items. By the fall of 2002, Kruse's revenue had dropped by 50% from the time of purchase and eBay selected to sell the business back to its original owner to focus on its core online business.\n\nPayment systems\n\nEBay's failed acquisition list also included prominent payment solution providers. The company bought Billpoint in 1999, but struggled to compete with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which had established a first-mover advantage in person-to-person payments. Further, its C2C user community eyed the integration of Billpoint with skepticism since eBay was so dominant at the time in marketplace transactions. The Billpoint service battled with PayPal for three years, when eBay finally ceded and reluctantly bought PayPal in 2002 and dismantled Billpoint.\n\nIn 2015, PayPal was spun off as a separate company.\n\nGlobal expansion into Asia\n\nBy 2000, eBay had expanded into Europe and Australia, but hit roadblocks when expanding into the Asian market due to cultural clashes and Yahoo Auctions' presence in Japan. EBay withdrew from Japan in 2002. Its China penetration attempt included the acquisition of EachNet, China's largest online marketplace at the time, in 2003 for $180 million, but eBay's entrance into the market was quickly trounced on by TaoBoa, owned by Alibaba. In 2007, eBay withdrew from the Chinese market as well.\n\nClassifieds and listing services\n\nEBay has also forayed into the online classifieds arena with the purchase of some companies like mobile.de and OpusForum.org in Germany, Marktplaats.nl in the Netherlands, LoQUo in Spain and Gumtree in the U.K. In addition to establishing eBay's online classifieds business, these acquisitions also helped to establish its foothold in the global marketplace and broaden expansion in automobile categories. However, the company had problems with integrating various online classified stakes due to business or global culture differences.\n\nThe company bought a 28.4% stake in Craigslist in 2004 for $32 million to assist in building out its advertising listing business. EBay was initially planning a buyout of Craigslist, but the relationship between the two companies soured almost immediately when shortly after the deal, the New York Attorney General's office began an antitrust investigation into the transaction, triggering Craigslist's management to distance themselves from eBay to avoid antitrust litigation.\n\nFurther contentions occurred when eBay launched its Kijiji advertising listing service in the U.S. in 2007, which competed directly with Craigslist (Kijiji, started in 2005, was already an established listing service in Canada by that time). Craig Newmark and Jim Buckmaster, Craigslist's founder and CEO, requested that eBay sell their shares back to the company, but eBay was unwilling to comply. After consulting outside council, Craigslist adopted a rights plan and sent eBay a letter giving it 90 days to resolve competitive activity before revoking its rights related to its share of the company. EBay filed an action with the Supreme Court of Delaware, accusing Craigslist of implementing a poison pill. Craigslist countersued, accusing eBay of unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, false advertising, trademark infringement, and other wrongs. The court sided with eBay and the antagonistic relationship continued until 2015, when eBay decided to sell the shares back to Newmark and Buckmaster and dismiss litigation between the two companies.\n\nEBay also purchased Rent.com in 2004 for a huge premium to gain ground in the real estate market and enhance its classified listing business. Analysts doubted that it was a good strategic move as the company was not aligned with eBay's core business. Rent.com did not achieve profitability, and eBay sold the company in 2012 to PRIMEDIA at a $375 million loss from the original purchase price.\n\nVideo chat services\n\nEBay bought Skype in 2005 for $2.6 billion, intending to use the service to enhance its community features between buyers and sellers, but its customer base did not embrace the service's video chat features when conducting online transactions. The company took a $1.4 billion write-down on its acquisition in 2007 and divested 65% of the company two years later to a group of private investors for an estimated loss of approximately $700 million to focus on its commerce business. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) picked up Skype two years after the sale for $8.5 billion.\n\nBrick and mortar e-commerce services\n\nIn 2011, eBay acquired GSI Commerce, a leading provider of e-commerce and interactive marketing services, for approximately $2.4 billion, a 51% premium, to expand its e-commerce and multichannel retailing capabilities. The acquisition continued to operate as a separate business unit and was rebranded as eBay Enterprises in June 2013.\n\nAt the same time, eBay divested most of its holdings in the unit's e-retail specialty businesses to GSI's founder and former CEO Michael Rubin for an undisclosed amount. By the end of 2015, the company decided to sell eBay Enterprises to a consortium of three investment companies for $925 million, a decrease of nearly $1.5 billion from the original purchase price. EBay's shares dropped 6% after the announcement of the sale.\n\nCurrent environment\n\nSince 2019, eBay has restructured to refocus on its Marketplace business, but this is not the company's first rodeo. It has made recommitments to this strategy in 2002 and 2009 in addition to this latest claim. Although its classified listing and StubHub business units were thriving, it sold classifieds to Adevinta for $9.2 billion and StubHub to viagogo. In addition, the company sold eBay Korea LLC to Emart for approximately $3 billion. Revenue streams now consist of the Marketplace and advertising and a standalone business unit, TCGplayer, which the company bought in 2022. The company also holds minority interests in Adeventa, Adyen warrant, Kakao Bank and Gmarket totaling $4.6 billion. EBay also recently invested in COMC, a marketplace for game card collectors. The proceeds from recent divestitures have allowed the company to maintain a healthy cash flow and implement a stock buyback program designed to increase shareholder value. Its investment in payment system integration, called Managed Payments, has improved the company's take rate (the amount of revenue eBay gains per transaction.) This is a sound business strategy, but investors' tentativeness is likely due to its growth uncertainty based on its erosion of market share against larger competitors.\n\nAmazon has approximately 40% of the online e-commerce retail market and over twice as many user visits as eBay. JD.com and Alibaba have dominated the Chinese fortress, and Walmart is gaining ground. Currently, 10% of Walmart transactions are done online. The charts below reflect eBay's share of the e-commerce marketplace compared to those of competitors in terms of market capitalization and revenue. EBay's Business Model: Value Play or Value Trap? EBay's Business Model: Value Play or Value Trap?\n\nAs can be seen above, eBay's position is minuscule compared to those of Amazon, Alibaba and JD.com. Amazon clearly dominates the e-retailer market in terms of market capitalization, indicating the stock still has strong investor sentiment despite selling for over 80 times earnings. JD.com dominates the field in terms of revenue, but sales are mostly confined to China. In that sense, Alibaba and JD.com are anomalies compared to other companies that have established a global presence. Most analysts anticipate additional erosion of eBay's market share to its largest competitors. EBay lost its foothold as a dominant player in the global e-commerce market during the 2010s. Another concern is that eBay's user base is aging. Users are typically older than those of other marketplaces and the site tends to be most popular among 55 to 65-year-old users, but the site has captured the attention of some younger users as well. The site is also touting its image as a sustainable commerce company that impacts the global environment by encouraging the reuse of existing products. EBay's market share is strongest in the U.S., UK and Germany and the company has room to capture additional users in those two latter markets.\n\nWhen viewed in this light, we can understand why investor and analyst sentiment is cool. EBay has carved out a niche in the wider market, but its future as a value play or a value trap depends on its ability to capture additional share in a mature, declining market. The current list of acquisitions includes Sneaker Con's authentication business in 2021; KnownOrigin, TCGplayer and MyFitment Group in 2022; and Cetilogo in 2023. KnownOrigin is a marketplace for non-fungible token collectors. TCGplayer is an online marketplace for trading card games that is operated autonomously from eBay. MyFitment Group (consisting of myFitment LLC and Illumaware LLC) provides technology that allows users to ensure the proper fit for vehicle parts bought on eBay's platform. Certilogico provides artificial intelligence-powered apparel and fashion goods authentication technology. EBay claims these acquisitions are aligned with Marketplace focus and will help build out its collectibles categories. Some of these acquisitions appear to be legitimate offshoots, but they could also become a replay of past failed buyouts. The bright spot is eBay has accumulated a vast amount of experience surrounding acquisitions and partnerships and appears to act quickly when business units go awry, thus avoiding sunk costs. With sound financials, eBay should be able to weather any storms of a softening market or its declining market position.\n\nConclusion\n\nEBay's success can be attributed to its niche business strategy focusing on the third-party trading market that generates good capital returns and brand success. For these reasons, the company is a stable investment that can continue to generate returns for its shareholders. Unfortunately, it is a mature company that's market is declining.\n\nIn the past, eBay has attempted to gain synergies and capture additional users through seemingly aligned acquisitions and partnerships, but has made some miscalculations along the way. Its continued success and value to shareholders will depend on its ability to capture additional share of prospective markets without going too far off course.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) was a hot market last year, and that trend is expected to continue in 2024. Forecasts indicate the AI industry will skyrocket from $207.9 billion in 2023 to nearly $2 trillion by 2030.\n\nBut just because an organization uses AI doesn't mean it can deliver multiple years of results. To find stocks with long-term potential, invest in companies with track records of success with it.\n\nHere are three such companies to consider: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Not only has each achieved impressive results with AI, but they also operate in different industries, providing you with a diversified portfolio. Here is why these companies make compelling investments.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThe e-commerce retailer uses AI to manage the army of robots in its warehouses, where they work around the clock to help achieve lightning-fast delivery speeds, sometimes within hours of a customer order.\n\nAmazon's AI technology also can predict which products are in demand based on location and when customers will want them. This enables the company to work with suppliers to make sure these products are in stock when needed.\n\nAI also helps third-party sellers on Amazon's site to create product listings. The success of these sellers is important: They delivered $34.3 billion of Amazon's $143.1 billion in third-quarter sales. That's more than the $23.1 billion in third-quarter revenue generated by Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing platform.\n\nAWS provides AI services to other businesses, such as United Airlines, helping AWS to maintain its position as the global leader in cloud computing.\n\nThat enabled Amazon to achieve a 13% year-over-year jump in third-quarter sales to $143.1 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter sales to reach at least $160 billion, a 7% increase over the previous year.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet uses AI across an array of services. For example, its YouTube receives over 500 hours of content every minute. That requires AI to ensure all videos comply with YouTube policies, and over 95% of removed videos were detected by AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe technology is also strengthening its position in the search-engine space. If you have used Google to perform a search with a photo, it was Alphabet's AI that analyzed the image.\n\nAI is also a component of the company's all-important advertising business, which accounted for $59.6 billion of Alphabet's $76.7 billion in third-quarter revenue. It helps advertisers create digital ads, and as of the third quarter, around 80% of advertisers were using the company's AI products.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be a momentous one as it plans to change how its Chrome web browser targets consumers with digital ads. On top of that, forecasts suggest a strong year in 2024 for digital advertising, with predictions calling for 13% growth in digital ad spending, which is higher than the past two years. This suggests it will be a windfall year for Alphabet's ad business.\n\n3. Palantir\n\nLast year, data analytics company Palantir released its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), and it's been a boon. Businesses are using it to boost operations, such as improving procurement efficiencies, and increasing the fill rate for online orders.\n\nPalantir nearly tripled the number of businesses using AIP in the third quarter alone as its customer count jumped 34% year over year.\n\nIts AI capabilities only strengthen Palantir's economic moat since its systems were built to handle classified government intelligence data. This enabled the company to win customers such as the U.S. government's Special Operations Command (SOCOM), which awarded Palantir a multiyear contract to help its AI-powered mission command platform.\n\nThe demand for Palantir's AI feature helped to deliver strong results. In the third quarter, the company enjoyed double-digit revenue growth as sales rose from $477.9 million in 2022 to $558.2 million. And this is just the latest in years of rising revenue. PLTR Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company also achieved what CEO Alexander Karp called, \"the most significant profit in our company's 20-year history\" as third-quarter net income reached $73.4 million, a dramatic turnaround from the prior year's net loss of $123.9 million.\n\nAnd exiting the third quarter, Palantir's balance sheet was impressive. Total assets were $4.2 billion with $3.3 billion of that in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Contrast this with total liabilities of $921.5 million.\n\nThe secular trend of artificial intelligenceis delivering meaningful results for Palantir, Alphabet, and Amazon. As a result, these three companies are well positioned to deliver ongoing revenue growth over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock didn’t have a great 2023, but 2024 is looking up. China’s e-commerce giant supports online transactions domestically and internationally. The company operates through a variety of subsidiaries, including Taobao, Tmall, AliExpress, and Alipay.\n\nUnfortunately, Alibaba has received little positive press recently. From shelving its cloud computing unit’s IPO to falling behind in market capitalization to competitors, the company that was once Asia’s most valuable tech company, seems to have lost its way. Despite the bad press, Alibaba still has many positives. Here are three reasons why I think BABA is still a good buy.\n\nBABA Stock and Cloud Computing\n\nAlibaba’s e-commerce platform relies on Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group for its vital cloud infrastructure. Alibaba Cloud serves as the cloud computing arm of Alibaba.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis cloud network not only provides the digital infrastructure to execute e-commerce transactions but also provides the necessary cloud services for other online businesses not engaged in e-commerce, including companies operating in the gaming, retail, finance, healthcare, and education industries.\n\nAlibaba Cloud Intelligence Group had lackluster growth in early 2023, but its cloud business unit achieved record year-over-year EBITDA growth in Q2. In their Q3 earnings report, cloud revenue grew 2% Y/Y to $3.8 billion, driven by demand in public cloud products and services.\n\nAs China’s economy continues its slow recovery, Alibaba’s cloud computing arm could stand to benefit, not only as more users conduct transactions online but also as businesses invest more in their cloud infrastructure.\n\nBABA’s e-commerce Potential\n\nTo date, Alibaba has amassed a user base of over 1 billion annual active consumers across its e-commerce platforms. Unfortunately, the company is facing competition from companies like Pinduoduo or PDDHoldings (NASDAQ:PDD) and ByteDance, the owner of social media platform, TikTok.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe increasing competitive environment has prompted the e-commerce giant to shuffle around management and heads of business units.\n\nIn late December, the Financial Times reported that Eddie Wu, currently the CEO of the entire Alibaba Group, will not only run the company’s Cloud Intelligence Group but also its e-commerce arms, Taobao and Tmall Group. This will hopefully encourage alignment between the tech group’s strategies and goals.\n\nBABA Looks Good Here\n\nThe messy restructuring, increased competition, and shelved IPO of its cloud arm has left Alibaba’s stock scarred. The announcement that the company was not going to publicly list Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group led to a rapid $20 billion loss in its market capitalization.\n\nBABA’s shares ended 2023 down nearly 11%. Now, closing in on the end of January, Alibaba’s shares have plummeted an additional 10%.\n\nThis provides an immense opportunity for value investors who are looking to hold long-term. BABA’s shares currently trade at 7.7x forward earnings and 4.7x forward EBITDA.\n\nThese forward-looking multiples are quite low compared to other cloud computing and e-commerce giants, like PDD and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nIf investors choose to allocate now, they could lock in a cheap price for a company that is still, despite the controversy, immensely valuable.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Retail sales climbed a very impressive seasonally adjusted 0.8% in December when compared to November. And retail sales jumped 5.6% in December year-over-year (YOY), coming in significantly above inflation which is running below 4%. Additionally, the University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment rose 21% YOY this month to 78.8. Moreover, the index’s gain in the last two months was the greatest advance over such a period in more than 30 years. So consumers’ confidence is clearly rapidly increasing, causing their spending to surge. In such an environment, the top consumer discretionary companies should thrive. As a result, buying the best consumer discretionary stocks is a good move. Here are three names within the category to buy.\n\nDutch Bros (BROS) A Dutch Bros coffee shop representing BROS Stock.\n\nSource: Alexander Oganezov / Shutterstock.com\n\nA prominent investment bank recently issued a bullish note on coffee retailer Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS). The upbeat assessment may suggest that Wall Street is getting very enthusiastic about BROS stock.\n\nOn Jan. 16, Stifel raised its rating on the shares to “buy” from “hold.” According to the bank, BROS is starting to develop transaction generating strategies such as a loyalty rewards program. Additionally, Stifel is upbeat about the company’s decision to ramp up its paid advertising and its promotion of its new products. Stifel placed a $35 price target on BROS stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company’s top line to jump to $1.2 billion this year from $964 million last year, and the firm’s earnings per share are expected to come in at 37 cents, versus 27 cents in 2023.\n\nThe shares have a reasonable price-sales ratio of four.\n\nlululemon (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall.

LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nYoga apparel retailer lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) recently issued a positive preannouncement, indicating that the demand for its products continues to be strong and is still increasing rapidky.\n\nSpecifically, the firm reported that its top line would come in at $3.17 billion to $3.19 billion, up from its prior guidance of $3.13 billion to $3.17 billion. Assuming the new guidance is accurate, the company’s revenue jumped 14% to 15% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nLULU reported that its Q4 earnings per share would come in at $4.96 to $5, versus its previous guidance of $4.85 to $4.93.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that LULU’s revenue from China soared 53% in the third quarter versus the same period a year earlier, indicating that LULU is making significant inroads into the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nLULU’s rock-solid business and strong growth make it one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy.\n\nRivian (RIVN) A new Rivian R1T truck is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California.

Additionally, Needham noted that the prices of the company’s used EVs are higher than those of its peers.\n\nFurther, RIVN stock would be bolstered by strong demand for its delivery vans from companies, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and AT&T (NYSE:T).

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Casey's, Target, Amazon.com and American Eagle Outfitters",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 24, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY, Target Corp. TGT, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Retail Stocks to Play the Surge in Consumer Sentiment\n\nIn a promising turn of events, January has seen a remarkable surge in U.S. consumer sentiment, reaching its highest level in two and a half years. The University of Michigan's recent report indicates an upswing in optimism. This surge in sentiment comes hand in hand with a decline in inflation expectations, signaling a potential shift in the economic landscape.\n\nThe University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment for January stands at an impressive 78.8, the highest since July 2021 and a significant leap from December's 69.7. This unexpected positive turn is occurring against a backdrop of a robust stock market, a healthy job market and stable gasoline prices.\n\nOne of the key takeaways is the decline in consumers' inflation expectations for the next 12 months to 2.9%, the lowest level since December 2020. This shift in expectations, down from 3.1% in December, aligns with a range observed before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prospect of lower inflation is welcomed news for the Federal Reserve, potentially opening the door for interest rate cuts in the coming months.\n\nThis surge in confidence could play a pivotal role in allaying fears of an impending recession. Despite inflation and high interest rate concerns, Americans maintained a spending spree driven by strong employment and wage gains.\n\nInvestors, in light of these positive developments, should consider strategic opportunities in the market. Sectors that traditionally thrive in times of economic optimism, such as retail, may present compelling investment avenues. As inflation expectations ease and consumer sentiment continues to improve, astute investors may find opportunities to capitalize on a more positive economic outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\n4 Prominent Picks\n\nCasey's General Stores, Inc. is a potential pick. Casey's price and product optimization strategies, increased penetration of private brands and digital engagements comprising the mobile app and online ordering capabilities are commendable. As the third-largest convenience retailer and the fifth-largest pizza chain, its distinctive self-distribution model, robust Inside category performance and strategic acquisitions are noteworthy strengths.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Casey's current fiscal sales and EPS suggests growth of 0.3% and 9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 17.8%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nInvestors can count on Target Corp. This Minneapolis, MN-based company has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the dynamic retail landscape. Target has been deploying resources to enhance omnichannel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. These have been contributing to the top line.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Target’s current financial-year EPS suggests growth of 38.5% from the year-ago reported figure. TGT, which sports a Zacks Rank #1, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 30.8%, on average.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is worth considering. The company’s robust e-commerce platform, renowned for its vast product selection and efficient delivery services, continues to be a primary driver of revenue growth. Prime membership, a cornerstone of Amazon's success, not only fosters customer loyalty but also drives recurring revenues through subscription fees, offering members exclusive access to a myriad of services, such as expedited shipping.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 11.1% and 278.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. AMZN, which sports a Zacks Rank #1, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 54.9%, on average.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters, Inc. is worth betting on. The company’s efforts to rationalize inventory and contain costs are paying off. The strong performance of key brands like American Eagle and Aerie, coupled with expansions into premium and activewear segments, indicates potential for growth. Its store designs and online enhancements demonstrate a commitment to improving the customer experience.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Eagle Outfitters’ current fiscal sales and EPS suggests growth of 5% and 43.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. AEO, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 23%, on average.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Taiwan Semiconductor, NVIDIA, Salesforce, and Amazon.com",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 24, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, NVIDIA NVDA, Salesforce CRM, and Amazon.com AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 S&P 500 Growth Stocks to Buy as Index Enjoys Bull Market\n\nThe S&P 500 bounced back in 2023 after taking a beating in the prior year, gaining an encouraging 24% as steady economic growth squashed any expectations of an impending recession, while price pressures came down to levels that compelled the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 was off to a rough start in 2024 as market participants took some profits in tech bigwigs such as Apple Inc. But they recently returned to buy back those magnificent tech players, helping the S&P 500 enter a bull market. The broader index has soared more than 35% from its October 2022 low.\n\nFor the first time, the S&P 500 finished at a record close, in more than two years. The index has also set an intraday record high after gyrating in a tight trading range for nearly a month. The large-cap benchmark closed at 4,839.81 on Jan 19 and exceeded the previous record close of 4,796.56 achieved on Jan 3, 2022. Additionally, the index hit an intraday high of 4,842.07, easily topping the intraday record of 4,818.62 attained on Jan 4, 2022, per FactSet data.\n\nNow, bull markets generally tend to last for quite some time. The previous bull market that started in March 2020 continued for less than two years. What’s more, the bull market that began before that prevailed for almost 10 years. It began from the Great Recession period till the outbreak of the coronavirus in February 2020. Similarly, the current bull market is expected to continue as stocks gain momentum, banking on a less hawkish Fed, upbeat consumer sentiment, and uptick in tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs inflation has started to show signs of cooling down, the Fed has kept its interest rates unchanged in the last meeting and is widely expected to trim rates this year. Interest rate cuts are always a boon for the stock market as they boost consumer outlays, decrease the cost of borrowings, and pep up the economy (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates in 2024).\n\nAmericans are anyhow feeling much more optimistic about the current and future business scenarios, thanks to the strength in the labor market. The University of Michigan stated that its consumer sentiment index surged 21.4% year over year in January and touched its highest level since July 2021. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index, too, had touched the highest level in December since July (read more: Raise a Toast to These 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks in 2024).\n\nTech stocks, meanwhile, are gaining traction due to AI optimism. Taiwan Semiconductor’s latest upbeat earnings report also bolstered confidence for the chip sector. Gains in mega-cap tech stocks eventually erased the S&P 500’s 2024 losses. Hence, with the S&P 500 scaling upward, it's prudent for astute investors to place bets on growth stocks listed in the index.\n\nSome of the prominent names are NVIDIA, Salesforce, and Amazon.com. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 12.9% over the past 60 days. NVDA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268.6%.\n\nSalesforce is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Salesforce currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. CRM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 56.5%.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.8% over the past 60 days. AMZN’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 278.9%.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Coming: 1 Monster Growth Stock That Could Be the \"Next Amazon\" to Buy Now",
        "content": "The Latin American economy stumbled in 2023, but World Bank economists expect growth to accelerate in 2024 and 2025 as inflation moderates and interest rates fall. That should be a catalyst to business and consumer spending across the region, and few companies are better positioned to benefit than MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI).\n\nAnother favorable tailwind is also taking shape. The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has rebounded from its bear market lows and recently rallied to a new record high. Some investors believe the index has already entered a bull market.\n\nThe S&P 500 returned an average of 169% during the last dozen bull markets, and many stocks will move much higher during the next one. That could certainly be a tailwind for MercadoLibre.\n\nMercadoLibre is the largest e-commerce company in Latin America\n\nMercadoLibre runs the largest online commerce and fintech ecosystem in Latin America. Its marketplace is the most visited digital shopping destination in the region, and the market leader in terms of revenue. Additionally, its complementary payments business Mercado Pago is the sixth-largest but fastest-growing acquirer, according to management.\n\nThat scale is an important competitive advantage for two reasons. First, it creates a powerful network effect that makes the marketplace more attractive to merchants and customers as the ecosystem expands. Second, it gives MercadoLibre a data advantage. The company processes millions of transactions daily, and each one improves its ability to prevent fraud and provide financial services like merchant loans and consumer credit products.\n\nBuilding on that, MercadoLibre can also engage customers and source shopper data unlike any other Latin American retailer, so it has naturally become the largest retail advertiser in the region. In fact, that portion of its business is booming. Advertising revenue grew faster than 70% in the last six quarters, and Insider Intelligence believes MercadoLibre will be the fastest-growing ad tech company in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre has further cemented its leadership in commerce by investing heavily in logistics capabilities. The company offers shipping and fulfillment services to merchants, and fast and reliable delivery to buyers, making its marketplace more attractive. That value proposition is resonating on both sides. MercadoLibre's logistics network handled a record 94.2% of all shipments in the third quarter, and almost 80% of those shipments were delivered within 48 hours.\n\nIn short, MercadoLibre has followed the Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) blueprint. It started with a core e-commerce business, then expanded into adjacencies like payments, logistics, and digital advertising. That strategy should continue to pay off for both companies. That said, Amazon is worth about 20 times more than MercadoLibre. Much of that discrepancy is related to Amazon's cloud computing business, something that MercadoLibre (so far) lacks.\n\nMercadoLibre reported strong growth in the third quarter\n\nMercadoLibre looked strong in Q3. Total revenue increased 40% to $3.7 billion, reflecting 45% sales growth in the commerce business and 33% sales growth in the fintech business. Additionally, GAAP net income climbed 178% to $359 million as profit margin expanded nearly five points. That improved profitability was primarily driven by higher interest income (due to higher interest rates) and improved asset quality across its credit portfolio.\n\nManagement also provided noteworthy commentary on the earnings call. MercadoLibre recently launched its streaming platform Mercado Play and short-video platform Mercado Clips, both of which create new advertising opportunities. The company also relaunched its Meli+ loyalty program during Q3 with more compelling shipping benefits and access to streaming video content, including Disney+ by Walt Disney.\n\nNot to belabor the point, but those moves are reminiscent of Amazon's Prime Video platform and Prime membership program.\n\nMercadoLibre stock is trading at a reasonable price\n\nThrough the end of the decade, retail e-commerce sales are expected to increase at 8% annually, digital payments revenue is expected to increase at 21% annually, and the ad tech market is expected to expand at 14% annually, according to analysts. Those are worldwide forecasts, but investors can assume similar trajectories in Latin America, given that regional economic expansion is expected to align with global economic expansion.\n\nMercadoLibre should grow faster than the market average in all three cases due to its scale and brand authority. Indeed, the Wall Street consensus calls for 24% annual sales growth over the next five years. This forecast makes its current valuation of about 6.4 times sales seem reasonable. That multiple is a discount to the three-year average of 8.8 times sales and a fair price for a company that looks like Amazon did 10 years ago.\n\nPatient investors should feel very comfortable buying this growth stock today. MercadoLibre may not be a $1.6 trillion company like Amazon any time soon, but it could certainly multiply several times in value over the next decade.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Low Cost Products With High Profit Margins.\n\nIncreasing Personalization is Key for Online Sellers\n\nAccording to Forbes, the outlook for e-commerce in 2024 seems competitive and fierce. While the vision is positive for the first half of the year, the expected economic strains in the second half may leave a dent in consumer buying. Forbes, however, does suggest key factors to keep in mind for online sellers. Online sellers are expected to integrate personalization and customization of products and content using artificial intelligence. The new Google AI-driven Search Generative Experience beta positions an immense focus on high-quality content with accurate linking and placement of images. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also experimenting with contextual search and shopping to enhance the customer experience, especially on mobile. Such implies that online sellers must significantly invest in improving mobile-based selling. Moreover, sellers need to be more mindful of the trends in the market. For instance, live streaming and video content are expected to be one of the most traffic-inducing content forms ahead of 2024. Showcasing and storytelling through videos will be key for online sellers. Lastly, social commerce or smartphone commerce coupled with multi-channel selling may take the lead as primary selling procedures.

With that, let's discuss the 30 low cost products with high profit margins. 30 Low Cost Products With High Profit Margins\n\n30 Low Cost Products With High Profit Margins\n\nOur Methodology\n\nComing up with a methodology for the 30 low cost products with high profit margins was a difficult task. Therefore, we employed a consensus approach to identify some of the low cost products trending in the market. We sifted through 4 reports on the internet including AliDropship, Hostinger, Shopify, and Alibaba. We only included products that appeared in at least 50% of our sources. Since it was not possible to get aggregated net margins for each product, we used product demand as a metric to assess the profitability of a product. We resorted to Amazon's \"Best Seller\" tab and used the number of reviews as an assessment of the product demand. Our list of the 30 low cost products with high profit margins is in ascending order of the number of customer reviews on Amazon as a primary metric and the retail price of the product on Amazon. All values were sourced on January 23, 2024.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "The Magnificent Seven are set to report their quarterly results, with Tesla (TSLA) set to report on Wednesday January 24 after the market close. Satori Fund Founder and Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Niles joins Yahoo Finance Live to provide insight on his top stock picks are in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nNiles sees growth potential for Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS, but states that investors should focus on “some of the other stuff that’s going on,” such as operating profits and the soon-to-be introduced ad incorporation on Prime Video.\n\nNiles believes that when looking at AI and the Magnificent Seven, investors will have to “differentiate” between AI stocks given the different AI-related offerings that many big tech companies have, insisting “selectivity is key” heading into earnings.\n\nFor Meta (META), Niles calls the valuation \"compelling,\" adding that the platform will likely get a boost from election year advertising spending.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- All eyes on big tech as the Magnificent Seven stocks gear up to report their latest results with excitement around AI and caution on economic activity. What is the best way to play tech right here? Well, here to discuss is Dan Niles, Satori Fund founder and senior portfolio manager.\n\nDan, it is great to have you on the show. And I want to dig right in, Dan, to the Magnificent Seven. Because listen, there's a lot of viewers listening right now.\n\nThey own these names, Dan. They're trying to figure out what to do with them. And you still see some opportunity, at least with some of those names.\n\nAnd so I want to dig into some of those picks. And one is Amazon, Dan, which has had a tremendous run. It's up about 60% over the past 12 months.\n\nBut you see still better days ahead for Amazon. I'm guessing, Dan, in part, that must be because you look at AWS, the company's profit center. And you must see that accelerating over the next few quarters here.\n\nStory continues\n\nDANIEL NILES: It's actually not so much driven by AWS. I mean, I think is an important piece because, obviously, so many investors are focused on it. And you saw the growth there slow from about 40% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 12% in each of the last two quarters.\n\nAnd I do see that picking up a few points going forward. Because, obviously, AI is the theme, right? And everybody's trying to deploy it and figure out how to make it work.\n\nBut the real driver in my mind is some of the other stuff that's going on. Because if you look at last quarter, they beat operating profits by 40%, 40. And that was driven by the retail margins really starting to expand.\n\nBecause don't forget, these guys put in a lot of capacity during COVID. Then as we came out of COVID, demand really slowed down for e-commerce. And so now as they're filling those high overhead distribution hubs and you're getting a ton of margin leverage.\n\nAnd then on January 29, they're going to start showing ads to all the Prime Video users. And that's 60% operating margin business relative to high single digits for the overall company. So that's going to be massively accretive.\n\nAnd so when I look at all of that, I can see EPS doubling by 2025 relative to where it is in 2023. And that's why I like the company a lot.\n\n- Dan, I just want to zero in on one thing that you talked about there, which is that this is an AI adjacent or non-AI story when you're talking about Amazon. And I wonder if you broaden that out and look at the Magnificent Seven.\n\nI mean, there's going to be, again, I'm sure during all these earnings calls a lot of AI talk. But that's not how they're making their money right now. And PS they're still making a lot of money from this other stuff, right? So how should investors be thinking about AI and then the rest of these businesses?\n\nDANIEL NILES: Well, you have to remember the Magnificent Seven, it's easy to look at last year and go, wow, they were up 111%. But don't forget, the year before that, the Magnificent Seven were down 46%. So you're exactly right, Julie, in that.\n\nYou need to differentiate. And I think this earnings season because all of these stocks had such a huge rally in November and December. And so far at the beginning of this year, you're going to see that start to break apart.\n\nAnd to some degree, you're seeing that during earnings season already. I mean, it's very early. But Logitech this morning is just getting absolutely destroyed after running up into their earnings.\n\nAnd so you're going to have to, I think, be very selective this year. That's why Amazon through AWS as Josh asked about, they've got a legitimate AI play there. 1/3 of the outsourced cloud market. That's where a lot of people are deploying to test out their AI capabilities.\n\nWe also like Meta quite a bit because the valuation is very compelling. You're talking about a company that's growing about 13% or so this year trading at a 22 PE. And to put that in perspective, the S&P is trading at a 20 PE.\n\nSo very small premium. And you've got an election coming up which is going to happen regardless of whether we get a recession or not at the end of this year. And they're using AI to help place ads to monetize those ads better and to recommend videos to you.\n\nAnd so they're seeing really good engagement there. And so that's why for us, we like those names. You look at an Apple, on the other hand, and you go, wait a minute. I'm supposed to pay almost 30 times for a company that's growing mid-single digits.\n\nI know retail investors love this name. And everybody has an iPhone. So it's very easy to own.\n\nBut on a risk reward basis, they've had negative year-over-year revenue growth for quarters. So I think you need to balance out where are you getting paid to take risk in terms of the multiple being low enough and there being enough upside where things can work out. And Apple for its part doesn't have an AI play really.\n\nAnd hopefully, they'll add that to the phones later this year. But right now, they're not an AI play, but they're being valued by them. So I think selectivity is key going into this earnings season.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the13 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors are still deeply divided over what the future might look like for the stock market in the weeks and months to come. While the bulls believe a soft landing is in sight, doubts remain over the Federal Reserve's possible plan of action regarding rate cuts as inflation remains sticky. A latest Wall Street Journal report cited CME FedWatch tool data which says there is now a 50% chance the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged during its March meeting. When 2024 was about to start this figure stood at just 3.85%. The optimism seen in the last quarter of 2023 was overwhelming and proved to be fickle. The WSJ report also said, citing swap contracts tied to the consumer-price index, that traders now see inflation at 2.4% over the next five years, the highest level since November. This shows we might be in for a long period of elevated inflation and high interest rates. In this environment, would mega-cap tech stocks like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which posted euphoric gains in 2023 be able to keep going higher? Only time would tell. For now let's take a look at the stocks that are trending these days.

The stock is moving after Bloomberg reported that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants his former finance minister to be the next CEO of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\nIn December, Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) disclosed that its iron ore production of 310M-320M metric tons in 2024 will be flat when compared to  2023.\n\nA total of 34 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE). The biggest stakeholder of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) during this period was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $243 million stake in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\nMiller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world’s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any “unreasonable” price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year’s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company’s market cap.”\n\n9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) ranks ninth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Earlier this month Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) posted domestic Q4 sales volumes, with record electric vehicle (EV) numbers. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) sold 25,937 EVs in the period, a growth of 24% on a YoY basis.\n\n8. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 52\n\nAT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is buzzing as investors get ready to see the company's fourth quarter earnings report. Earlier in the month Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $21 price target.\n\nOppenheimer's analysts see several tailwinds for the stock, including AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 120MHz C-Band portfolio which now covers over 200M point of presence, or POPs. Oppenheimer said that about 60% of AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) subscribers are now fiber, which means healthier margins and pricing leverage.\n\nIn addition to AT&T, other stocks trending right now include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). AT&T is one of the most buzzing stocks to buy right now popular among hedge funds.\n\nMiller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.\n\nAT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”\n\n7. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is creating a buzz as investors get ready to receive Intel Corp's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings report slated to be released on January 25. Recently, a Gartner report said Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) ranked first in the list of top semiconductor companies in 2023, with a  total semiconductor revenue of $48.7 billion.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The most significant stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is owned by William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns a $468 million stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel ranks fifth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\n6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are creating a buzz on the Wall Street as investors await Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings that are set to be announced on January 24. The stock also came in the limelight after Elon Musk expressed his desire to have about 25% voting control over Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in order to make Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) a leader in AI and robotics. Tesla ranks sixth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Like Tesla, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also trending.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have gained about 47% over the past one year. Some analysts expect Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings to come in weaker than expected amid pricing wars in the EV sector.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nTsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable 11 Stocks Insiders and Billionaires Are Crazy About\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Nowis originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Amazon.Com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) introduction of ads on Prime Video will likely impact the crowded U.S. streaming market significantly.\n\nAs the third-largest digital ad seller globally, Amazon’s $12 billion ad revenue in the third quarter marks a 26% increase from the previous year.\n\nTheir vast customer data offers a unique edge in targeted advertising.\n\nAnalysts see $6.6 billion – $8.0 billion of incremental revenue on the worldwide rollout of the plan.\n\nHowever, the transition into streaming ads faces challenges, as traditional media giants like Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and WarnerBros.

The company did not provide a reason for the layoffs. It said impacted workers can apply to other open positions at TikTok, which currently has more than 120 similar job listings.\n\nTikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance and has more than 150 million users in the U.S. The social media platform is known for short-form video content popular among Gen Z and younger users. In September, it also launched an e-commerce arm and marketplace that allows merchants to sell products on its platform.\n\nThe layoffs follow other job cuts at major tech companies this year, including at social media platforms like Discord and Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.\n\nTwitch said earlier this month it was cutting more than 500 jobs in a bid to save on costs. Meanwhile, Discord laid off 17% of its staff – or 170 employees – to bring more agility to its workforce, the company said.\n\nAmazon’s other businesses, such as the audiobook service Audible and its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit, have also been impacted by layoffs. Google, meanwhile, cut hundreds of employees off its payroll to save on costs.\n\nAll told, the tech industry has shed more than 10,000 jobs this year, according to the tech job tracking site layoffs.fyi.",

        "content": "Joe Biden's administration did not want to sign free trade agreements, according to Kemi Badenoch - REUTERS/Anna Rose Layden\n\nKemi Badenoch has accused Joe Biden of derailing the UK’s hopes of a trade deal with the US as the President pursues increasingly protectionist policies.\n\nThe Business Secretary said the President is the reason Britain missed its target to secure free trade agreements (FTAs) covering 80pc of its trade with the rest of the world.\n\nSpeaking to MPs on the Business and Trade Committee on Tuesday, Ms Badenoch said: “The biggest thing that has had an impact on us reaching that objective was the change in administration from President Trump to President Biden.”\n\nBritain began negotiations for an FTA with the US in May 2020 in what would have been the UK’s first major new agreement since it left the European Union. But there have been no discussions since October 2020. The following month, Mr Biden won the presidential election.\n\nMs Badenoch said: “We were carrying out negotiations for a US FTA, but then the administration changed and the Biden administration is just not doing FTAs. What they have basically said is that they’re not doing FTAs with anybody.\n\n“This isn’t about us, despite a lot of the narrative you might read in the press. It is just their strategy. They are not using free trade agreements.”\n\nInstead, the US government is pursuing smaller packages on single issues, such as deals with India and Japan over the trade of critical minerals or semiconductors, Ms Badenoch said.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration’s trade policies were broadly considered protectionist, the former president personally expressed a hope that a “very substantial” trade deal with the UK would boost trade between the two nations “three to four, five times” over.\n\nThe Biden administration marked a sea change in approach. Instead of negotiating overseas deals, Mr Biden has turned inwards, focusing on an American industrial policy and channelling hundreds of billions of dollars into green energy production via his Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nMs Badenoch’s comments came as the US prepares to head to the polls this November, which looks likely to be another contest between Mr Trump and Mr Biden.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of Mr Trump’s biggest competitors for the Republican nomination, Ron DeSantis, has dropped out of the race after failing to make waves during the first of the primaries.\n\nAside from its negotiations with the US, the UK has signed three major trade agreements since leaving the EU. These are with Australia, New Zealand and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a bloc which includes Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nThe UK has open negotiations on trade agreements with countries including India, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and South Korea.\n\nMs Badenoch said: “Some of that is going where the growth is. But it’s also about strengthening alliances with many of the countries that perhaps, if you look at the various axes, may not necessarily be on the Western side.”\n\nShe added that Britain must also court foreign investment to stop key services such as water suppliers from falling apart.\n\nCanadian pension institutions have become the second largest investor in British water companies because they are filling a gap left by British investors, Ms Badenoch said.\n\nShe added: “The issue is that our own pension companies are not investing in UK companies … if other companies don’t come in to invest, a lot of those services will just fall apart. It is really important for me to emphasise that we do want investment. We do not penalise foreign companies for doing so.”\n\nMs Badenoch blamed a surge in pensions red tape introduced in the 1990s which she said has caused British funds to divert cash away from domestic companies and into more risk-averse assets such as government bonds.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:12 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today. We’ll be back in the morning before London’s financial markets open. In the meantime, I’ll leave you with Jeremy Warner, our economics columnist, whose been writing about Donald Trump:\n\nNevermind Ron DeSantis throwing in the towel, when even Jamie Dimon, the combative JP Morgan boss, speaks up for Donald Trump you kind of know that not only is Trump’s nomination as the Republican presidential candidate now a foregone conclusion, but it’s also essentially over for the White House incumbent, Joe Biden.\n\nThe titans of Wall Street are by tradition nearly always Democrat-supporting, and so at least until recently was Dimon. But in an interview last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he seemed almost minded to switch sides.\n\n“Take a step back, be honest,” Dimon said. Trump “was kind of right about Nato, kind of right on immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China. He wasn’t wrong about some of these critical issues”.\n\nDimon then went on to warn against ridiculing Trump’s Make America Great Again mantra, because lots of ordinary Americans believe in it and it is discourteous to demonise their views. Now there’s a banker looking to grease up to – sorry, build bridges with – the likely winner.\n\nThere’s still nearly 10 months to go, and a lot can happen in that time, not least that Trump could be sent to jail.\n\nIn any case, polling this far ahead of the event tends not to mean a great deal.\n\nAll the same, Trump seems to have unstoppable momentum, and if you aren’t already thinking about the implications for the economy and markets of a second Trump presidency, then you had better start sharpish.\n\nRead on to find out what a second Trump presidency is likely to mean... Donald Trump gestures at a rally in New Hampshire yesterday - Mike Segar/Reuters\n\n05:12 PM GMT\n\nOfcom set to release Royal Mail review\n\nOfcom is set to release tomorrow morning the findings of its review into the universal service provided by Royal Mail after calls from the firm to drop its letter deliveries on Saturdays.\n\nIt is understood that the review update is not likely to recommend specific proposals but will outline evidence from Royal Mail and potential options to change the service to more closely meet the needs of customers.\n\nCurrently, Royal Mail has an obligation to deliver letters six days a week to all 32 million addresses in the UK for the price of a stamp, no matter where the letters are going.\n\nHowever, Royal Mail’s owner International Distributions Services revealed at the end of 2022 that it had formally asked the Government to switch from a six-days-a-week letter delivery service to five, covering Monday to Friday.\n\nRoyal Mail said the current service requirement is “simply not sustainable”.\n\nThe group said it would look to maintain a seven-day parcel delivery service.\n\nHowever, earlier this week, Downing Street had appeared to rule out allowing Royal Mail to scrap Saturday deliveries.\n\nShares in International Distributions Services have fallen 12.9pc over the past five years as its struggles to modernise its working practices and refocus the business on parcels.

Hannah Boland reports:\n\nShaun McCabe is stepping down as chief financial officer with immediate effect, Boohoo said. He will be replaced by ex-Cazoo finance boss Stephen Morana.\n\nIt comes amid signs of friction between Mr McCabe and Boohoo, with the online retailer understood to have been keen to make the executive change before any rift deepened.\n\nThe Telegraph understands that Mr McCabe is leaving because his expectations of what he could achieve as Boohoo’s chief financial officer were increasingly different to what Boohoo was expecting from his appointment.

Daniel Woolfson reports:\n\nMakers of sparkling and still wine are now able to sell their wine in pint bottles (568ml) after a legal change by the Government, which ministers hailed as a “Brexit freedom” in December.\r\n\r\nHowever, Andrew Carter, the chief executive of Chapel Down, criticised the move. He said the Government should instead focus on preventing closures in the hospitality industry by cutting VAT.\r\n\r\nHe said: “The pint bottle story that broke around Christmas was completely irrelevant. You know, there is no consumer desire for it. And operationally, there’s no glass and ability to be able to do it in any scale.\r\n\r\n“The way in which you source glass in this country and the large glass producers, there is a scale operation. And at this moment in time, there is no scale or desire to produce a [pint] bottle because that’s not where the market is.”\n\nMr Carter said that instead, the Government should look at ways to cut costs for hospitality businesses amid a rising tide of closures which has been blamed on the soaring cost of ingredients and wages, as well as a growing tax burden.\r\n\r\nIt comes as the Kent-headquartered Chapel Down said that sales grew 14pc to £17.9m in 2023, as shoppers increasingly favoured domestic fizz over champagne.\r\n\r\nRetail sales of English sparkling wine grew by 16pc over the year while Champagne sales fell 9pc, according to Nielsen data - although champagne sales are still significantly higher on the whole.\r\n\r\n“If we want to talk about an outlook for this country, in a 15 to 20-year timeframe, then there is no doubt in my mind that the English sparkling wine will be bigger than champagne,” he said.

James Warrington reports:\n\nHipgnosis last year set out plans to sell a catalogue of songs worth $440m (£347m) to a sister fund backed by Blackstone and managed by founder Merck Mercuriadis.\r\n\r\nShareholders blocked the deal in a bruising vote in October amid concerns about a hefty discount on the price tag.\r\n\r\nHowever, analysts have since raised concerns that the catalogue has grown at a materially higher rate to the rest of the portfolio, sparking accusations that Mr Mercuraidis had “cherry-picked” the songs.\r\n\r\nIn a note published last week, analysts at Stifel said the stark outperformance of the catalogue raised “awkward questions” for Mr Mercuriadis. Investec added that there was still “material valuation uncertainty” over the fund’s portfolio.\r\n\r\nHipgnosis’s board, which has been overhauled in recent months, will now investigate whether the songs were chosen for their strong performance and, if so, whether this was properly disclosed to the previous directors.\r\n\r\nBosses said they would examine “whether the previous board were provided with the relevant information to enable them to make a decision in the best interests of shareholders”.\r\n\r\nIf the investigation finds he has failed to act in the best interest of shareholders, it may constitute a breach of contract.\r\n\r\nA spokesman for Mr Mercuriadis’s investment advisers said they completely rejected the allegations.

The Chancellor could also adjust thresholds instead of rates.\n\nIncreasing the personal allowance by £600 to just over £13,000 would cost roughly £5bn or raising the rate at which people start paying the higher rate to around £54,000 would have a similar cost.\n\nThere are some other eye-catching policies he could announce with the money. Reducing inheritance tax from 40pc to 20pc would cost £3.6bn.

Primark launched a collection designed in collaboration with singer Rita Ora - Roy Rochlin/WireImage\n\n07:48 AM GMT\n\nGovernment's debt interest payments drop by £14.1bn\n\nThe Government paid £4bn in debt interest last month, which was £14.1bn less than in December last year.\n\nThe debt interest payments were thew lowest since the pandemic, and were brought down by the steep fall in inflation in December.\n\nMuch of the interest paid by the Government is tied to gilts linked to the outdated (and higher) retail prices index measure of inflation.\n\nDivya Sridhar, economist at PwC, said:\n\nThe relatively lower debt interest payments in December 2023 were a key driver of the lower monthly borrowing figure compared to recent months.\n\nLast month recorded the lowest December interest payment figure since 2020, and was less than a fourth of the interest payments paid in December 2022.\n\nDespite the small uptick in CPI inflation last month from 3.9pc to 4pc, we expect inflation pressures to continue easing over the coming months, further lowering government spending on interest payments.\n\n07:43 AM GMT\n\nBorrowing up £11.1bn on previous financial year\n\nTo step back for a moment, even though the Chancellor has spent less than anticipated, Government borrowing still remains is still the fourth highest by this point of a financial year on record.\n\nThe Treasury has so far borrowed £11.1bn more than it had done in the first nine months of the previous financial year.\n\nBorrowing in the financial year-to-Dec 23 was £119.1 bn, £11.1 bn more than in the same 9-month period last year and the 4th highest financial year-to-December borrowing on record behind those of the pandemic period (2020 and 21) and in 2009 following the global financial crisis. pic.twitter.com/w064Z6TKkK\n\n— Fraser Munro (@Fraser_ONS_PSF) January 23, 2024\n\n07:35 AM GMT\n\nChancellor to have £20bn headroom in the Budget, say economists\n\nThe Chancellor will have an extra £20bn to play with when he comes to deliver his March Budget, economists have suggested.\n\nThe wiggle room will come from the lower than expected Government borrowing combined with lower bond yields as the Bank of England cuts interest rates, which will lower the cost of borrowing.\n\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said:\n\nAfter nine months of the 2023/24 fiscal year, borrowing is on track to undershoot the OBR’s full-year borrowing forecast of £123.9bn by £5.0bn.\n\nWhat’s more, with market interest rate expectations and long-dated gilt yields having fallen since November, we suspect the OBR will revise down its borrowing forecast significantly from 2025/26.\n\nThat may provide the Chancellor with “headroom” against his fiscal mandate of about £20bn in the Budget.\n\nThat will probably allow him to unveil a freeze in fuel duty in April 2024 (costing about £6.0bn a year) but perhaps also to announce more crowd-pleasing measures, such as a 1p cut to income tax (costing £6.9bn a year), while still maintaining fiscally prudent appearances.\n\n07:19 AM GMT\n\nEconomy is beginning to turn a corner, says minister\n\nAs Government borrowing came in lower than expected, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said:\n\nProtecting millions of lives and livelihoods during Putin’s energy shock and a once in a century pandemic has created economic challenges.\n\nHowever, it is right that we pay back these debts so future generations are not left to pick up the tab.\n\nBecause of this Government’s decisive action, the economy is now beginning to turn a corner: Inflation has more than halved.\n\nDebt is on track to fall as a share of the economy. And we have been able to afford tax cuts for 27 million working people, and an £11 billion tax cut to drive business investment.\n\n07:18 AM GMT\n\nHunt's tax cut plans boosted as borrowing slows\n\nThe Government borrowed much less than expected last month, official figures showed, handing the Chancellor an extra £5bn for tax cuts ahead of the next election.\n\nPublic sector borrowing, excluding banks, rose by £7.8bn in December, according to the Office for National Statistics, which was less than the £14.1bn forecast by economists.\n\nIt was about half the borrowing made in the same month in 2022 and the lowest for the month since 2019.\n\nCrucially, total public sector net borrowing for the financial year so far reached £119.1bn in the nine months to December.\n\nThis was £5bn lower than the £124.1bn that the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that the Treasury would have spent by this point.\n\nIt comes as Jeremy Hunt dropped the strongest hint yet that he is planning to unveil a major package of tax cuts at the Spring Budget.\n\nThe Chancellor revealed that Treasury officials had provided him with “clear” proof that countries with lower tax burdens enjoyed higher economic growth.\n\nThe Treasury’s total debt stood at £2.68 trillion at the end of 2023, which was about 97.7pc of GDP.\n\nPublic sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was £7.8 billion in December 2023.\r\n\r\nThis was £8.4 billion less than in December 2022, and the lowest December figure since 2019.\r\n\r\n➡️ https://t.co/KEl5HlNE51pic.twitter.com/z00WhjRpRC\n\n— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 23,

        "title": "15 Countries with Highest Economic Mobility in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 countries with the highest economic mobility in the world. We will also shed light on social mobility efforts of some companies. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries With the Highest Economic Mobility in the World.\n\nThere are certain aspects of life that are beyond human control. When, where, and to whom you are born, is one such example. The innate stratification of classes within this world is yet another reality of life that determines to some extent most people’s journey on earth. However, we build our lives on the premise that not everything is predestined and hard work and dedication can play a significant role in goal achievement. It is this drive then that propels people to continuously improve themselves, whether it be to move up the socioeconomic ladder or some other loftier objective.\n\nEconomic mobility can be defined as the ability of people to upgrade their economic status over time. The concept of inter-generational move to a higher income bracket is especially relevant here. Nevertheless, the question that demands further clarification is that, can simply a desire for elevation to an upper class be enough? There are numerous other factors that must be accounted for before this objective is accomplished, thereby, rendering it with complexities that the world is still unraveling. Globally, people have been seen tethered to their parent's status and we find developed countries with higher economic mobility as compared to developing, low-income nations. Some of the countries found at the lower end of social mobility spectrum include Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\nFurthermore, while richer economies are associated with higher economic mobility, this is not set in stone. Certain welfare states like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark etc. provide their citizens with many amenities of life with little or no cost as well as equal opportunities in education. They have low-income inequality and therefore, are among countries with high economic mobility. Interestingly, the United States -- a welfare state with an impressive economy -- has low social mobility as compared to other developed countries. Raj Chetty’s probing research in understanding low economic mobility for the US brings to the forefront the fact that there is much geographical dispersion within the country.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis was found to be especially true for children from poor households. The government, however, is aware of the need for constant efforts for uplifting the socioeconomic status of their people. The DollarWise Economic Mobility Campaign has distributed grants for economic and health well-being to their cities for a long time and continues to do so. It has also been ascertained that some factors like education, household structure, and savings can have an impact on economic mobility of  the Americans.\n\nHumanity is grounded in the idea of equity between people and though the efforts for better social mobility definitely satisfies this condition, there are multifarious economic benefits that can be accrued as well. The World Economic Forum stipulates that a 10-point increase in the Global Social Mobility index of countries could lead to a potential $514 billion increase in global GDP.\n\nIs Socioeconomic development a purely government-level agenda?\n\nGiven the stress on economic and social mobility development, many companies are also playing their role, apart from the government. This includes big companies like Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), IBM (NYSE: IBM), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE: F), has established Ford Motor Company Fund that collaborates with non-profit firms to help disadvantaged people in various communities. For example, the Ford Resource and Engagement Center in Craiova, has only recently accepted 8 new entrepreneurship programs. These are supposed to provide employment opportunities for young people. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) has also used the fund to invest $5 million in transportation for Detroit and other US cities. The aim is to ensure transportation for people who lack the facility, thereby, positively impacting their economic opportunities.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have been known to spend millions in the education system. One of IBM’s (NYSE: IBM) program, called SkillsBuild, is a free education program aimed at tech-low communities. This would allow them a chance to learn and develop technological skills and thus, help land better jobs. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) YouthSpark Program is also a praiseworthy effort for building educational and career possibilities for children around the world.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is also not behind other companies in promoting economic mobility. Chosen as one of the top 75 UK employers for the Social Mobility Employer Index 2023, they provide ample evidence of their serious attitude towards fostering an equitable and progressive environment. 85% success rate of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) apprenticeship program as well as The JOBS Project and Career Choice are some of the examples that they can boast. 15 Countries With Highest Economic Mobility In The World\n\n15 Countries With Highest Economic Mobility In The World\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world, we have taken two different metrics. Firstly, we used our list of 15 countries with the highest social mobility in the world. Secondly, we used the latest Heritage Foundation Economic Freedom Index, 2023. The idea is that easier access to economic opportunities would allow people to attain a better living standard, thereby, allowing them to move up the ladder.\n\nWe then took the rankings of each country from both these lists and averaged them and then ranked our final list based on those average rankings. The list is presented in descending order.\n\nPlease note that in the case of similar average ranks, a country with a higher social mobility index ranking was placed higher.\n\nNote: The US's huge levels of income inequality prevented it from making it to the list. However, apart from that, the country is known for robust economic infrastructure and there are few regulatory obstacles to entrepreneurship.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere is a list of the countries with the highest social mobility in the world.\n\n15. Belgium\n\nSocial Mobility: 10\n\nEconomic Freedom Index: 43\n\nAverage Rank: 26.5\n\nThe Belgium government, for long, has adopted a model that aims at redistribution and timeless unemployment benefits strategy. What is an even more dedicated effort on their part for ensuring well-being of people at all times, is the indexation wages and pensions with inflation. In fact, the government has recently enacted reforms to enable pensioners to life a sustainable lifestyle. In addition, their excellent healthcare system as well as the early retirement option, are both indicative of the government’s desire to facilitate a prosperous lifestyle. Such measures are bound to have a positive impact in inter-generational economic mobility as well as social mobility. Their free open market policies encourage international trade and investment, thereby, provide opportunities for growth. Thus, it is no wonder that Belgium is one of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.\n\n14. Austria\n\nSocial Mobility: 9\n\nEconomic Freedom Index: 23\n\nAverage Rank: 16\n\nWhile Austria has fallen short in certain aspects of social mobility scale, as compared to other OECD countries, their overall performance still earns them a place on the list of countries with the highest social as well as economic mobility in the world. They have low income inequality. Their early childhood education rate has been on the rise and they also provide targeted support for children struggling in education -- an established indicator for economic mobility. Moreover, their tax and benefit system is strong, cushioning people against sudden income shocks. Recent “long-term care” plan, provides further evidence of their commitment to ensuring a prosperous life for their people. On top of this, their attitude towards maintaining rule of law and transparent as well as competitive business environment, has also brought them to the 23rd place in the economic freedom index. Therefore, we find them among the 15 countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.\n\n13. Canada\n\nSocial Mobility rank: 13\n\nEconomic Freedom Index rank: 16\n\nAverage Rank: 14.5\n\nCanadian society is one of the most socially mobile in the world, both within and across generations.  In fact, they are twice more socially mobile than the US. They are also ahead of United Kingdom. Research over the years have established that a child’s future in Canada is not linked to the financial status of their parents. 35% of their citizens have achieved a higher strata than their parents, depicting a clear trend towards economic mobility. Furthermore, strong rule of law, supporting environment for property rights, and proper implementation of commercial code, sustains a free economic situation in the country. Combined, these factors make Canada one of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.\n\n12. Australia\n\nSocial Mobility rank: 11\n\nEconomic Freedom Index rank: 13\n\nAverage Rank: 12\n\nWhile Australians have been identified with a fairly higher chance of inter-generational economic mobility as compared to other countries, the Treasury researchers are pessimistic about the future. Children born in the bottom fifth of the Australian households, have a 12.3% chance of moving up to the top five, in terms of income. However, this is still quoted as a 60% higher probability than that found in the US. Findings of a Treasury research report pointed to strong labor markets as a potential driver of economic mobility. Queensland and Western Australia were seen to depict this trend in the wake of the boom experienced by the mining industry. The economic freedom index also places Australia at a good place in the world ranking. Therefore, our average considers the country as one of the countries with the highest economic mobility.\n\n11. Iceland\n\nSocial Mobility rank: 5\n\nEconomic Freedom Index rank: 19\n\nAverage Rank: 12\n\nIceland is commended for various policies that center on equality and human rights protection. Their family policy, low gender disparity, low housing cost, technological reach, and internet freedom, are among the few that help label them as a highly progressive society. Combine this with an open-market system that fosters trade and investment, and you get one of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.\n\n10. Germany\n\nSocial Mobility rank: 8\n\nEconomic Freedom Index rank: 14\n\nAverage Rank: 11\n\nAccording to OECD, Germany has lower social mobility than other developed countries. Children of high-income households have a 50% chance of graduating high school, as compared to children born in low-income households. Researchers have also found that while mobility has been constant for the recent birth cohorts, there is substantial variation across regions within the country. The world ranking for Economic freedom Index has the country on the 14th place. They have an open-market policy and along with law and order supremacy, they enjoy a robust economy. Thus, these factors coupled together, we find Germany at the 10th position on our list of 15 countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.\n\n9. New Zealand\n\nSocial Mobility rank: 15\n\nEconomic Freedom Index rank: 5\n\nAverage Rank: 10\n\nNew Zealand is a strong advocate of fair women representation at all job levels. The government supports mitigation of gender disparity and their top public service positions have been more than adequately filled by women. Furthermore, they engage in policy making that ensures economic growth of the low-income population in the country. This is evidenced by the Recognized Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme, which has directly contributed towards higher living standards. Furthermore, with a strong, stable economy and compliance with rules and regulations, New Zealand has quite an impressive economic freedom index ranking, making them stand out as an economically mobile society.\n\n8. Luxembourg\n\nSocial Mobility rank: 12\n\nEconomic Freedom Index rank: 7\n\nAverage Rank: 9.5\n\nThe Global Social Mobility Report, 2020, ranks Luxembourg at the 10th position. Not only does the country excel in the health sector, they are also performing well in the education quality and equity aspect. Furthermore, the country’s intolerance towards corruption has nurtured an environment of transparency that encourages investment, open-market behavior, and entrepreneurship. Thus, it is no wonder that they make it to the list of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.\n\n7. Ireland\n\nSocial Mobility rank: 14\n\nEconomic Freedom Index rank: 3\n\nAverage Rank: 8.5\n\nIreland has recognized the necessity of educational uplift in order to promote and sustain social/economic mobility. A recent annual Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) conference brought many organizational leaders to the forum. Almost all of them were found to be keenly involved in pursuing educational programs that would foster social mobility. The country is also aware of the link between economic prosperity and social uplift. Therefore, they have formed an open-market, globally competitive, business and trade model that is bolstered with strong institutional performance.\n\n6. Finland\n\nSocial Mobility rank: 4\n\nEconomic Freedom Index rank: 11\n\nAverage Rank: 7.5\n\nFinland has been enjoying a top ranking on the Global Social Mobility Index for a while now. This is mainly credited to high income mobility. They have world top class educational system -- based on the inclusive education policy. It is also one of the most gender and income equal countries in the world. The cherry on the top is their social protection coverage. To the already awe inspiring list can be added the economic freedom maintained by the country. This should then not come as a surprise that Finland is one of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.\n\nClick here to see the 5 Countries With the Highest Economic Mobility in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Strongest Currencies in the World in 2024 15 Richest Countries that Pay You to Move There 30 Countries With Best Universities In The World\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Countries With the Highest Economic Mobility in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Large language models (LLMs) allow users to get a glimpse into the milieu of their social environment, as the responses of these models are determined by the aggregate thoughts and opinions of people at large. This means that models like Grok, a recently released LLM by X, can potentially be used as a starting point for finding high-return investments. This has led to the creation of this list of growth stock picks by Grok AI.\n\nGrok differs from models like ChatGPT and Claude as it has access to real-time data. Additionally, it has been trained on tens of billions of tweets. The advantage of using Grok over other models is that by the nature of its training data, it’s potentially more responsive to changes in investor opinion and sentiment, allowing users to get a real-time feel of how the market feels about a company before opening a position.\n\nIn the context of growth stocks, which are more speculative by nature than more mature businesses, Grok can be an invaluable tool for honing in on the best investment ideas. So here are the best growth stock picks by Grok AI for investors to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, Italy. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs Elon Musk owns a majority stake in X and was a key initiator of the Grok AI project, it may then not be so surprising to see Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of those growth stock picks by Grok AI.\n\nStill, TSLA has reached a kind of cult status of its own, and Wall Street analysts collectively believe that its share price will increase by 7% over the next twelve months.\n\nHere’s what Grok had to say about TSLA stock:\n\n“As the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy solutions, Tesla is well-positioned to be a leader in the electric vehicle market. With their innovative technology and growing global presence, Tesla’s stock is poised for significant growth in the coming years.”\n\nGrok’s assessment seems to be supported by analyst estimates for TSLA’s top and bottom lines. The company is expected to increase its EPS to $5.10 by 2025, along with strengthening its top-line revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another name that’s reached a cult-like status amongst growth investors. The recovery of its stock price has many investors feeling that the best is yet to come, as its stock price has gained roughly 60% over the past year.\n\nGrok weighed in on AMZN stock, stating:\n\n“Amazon has consistently shown strong growth over the years, and with the continued expansion of its e-commerce and cloud computing services, they are likely to continue this trend. Additionally, their recent investments in healthcare and grocery delivery services could provide new avenues for growth in the future.“\n\nInvestors may also appreciate that Wall Street shares some of Grok’s enthusiasm. AMZN stock is one of the few stocks in the Magnificent Seven that carry a “Strong Buy” recommendation.\n\nBlock (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) was Grok’s final recommendation, and I also share some of its enthusiasm.\n\nThe main reason I believe SQ stock will continue to be a strong performer is due to its Cash App competing strongly with other services like Venmo and Zelle. It also has a heavy presence in the crypto market, offering Bitcoin products and enabling Bitcoin-based commerce on its merchant platform.\n\nSince I’m bullish on both fintech and Bitcoin (BTC-USD), I believe that SQ’s continued integration of both will give it a key competitive advantage moving forward, especially as its peers are focused on traditional fiat transfers.\n\nBut here’s what Grok had to say about SQ stock:\n\n“Square’s innovative approach to financial services and payment processing has made them a popular choice among small businesses and consumers alike. With the increasing popularity of digital payments and the company’s expansion into new markets, Square’s stock is likely to see significant growth in the coming years.“\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Tuesday, January 23, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time scorecard of the Q4 earnings season and fresh analyst reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) and Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all the results that came out this morning, we now have Q4 results from 67 S&P 500 members or 13.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +0.3% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, with 83.6% beating EPS estimates and 67.2% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThis is a notably weaker earnings and revenue growth pace for these 67 index members relative to what we saw from this group of companies in other recent quarters.\n\nWhile the Q4 revenue growth for these companies is in-line with the decelerating growth trend that has been in place for the last few quarters, the sub-par earnings growth is primarily because of the Finance sector drag.\n\nHad it not been for the -2.7% earnings decline for the Finance sector at this stage, with 31.1% of the sector's companies having reported Q4 results, total earnings for the rest of the index members that have reported would be up +3.3% (vs. up +0.3% including Finance).\n\nThe Q4 EPS beats percentage of 83.6% for this group of 67 index members is unchanged from the preceding period (2023 Q3) and compares to the 20-quarter average of 78.2% for this cohort.\n\nThe Q4 revenue beats percentage of 67.2% is up from 65.7% in the preceding period and compares to the 20-quarter average of 69.4% for this group of 67 index members.\n\nLooking at Q4 as a whole, combining the actuals that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +0.5% from the same period last year on +2.3% higher revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+20.2% vs. +14.7%). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Home Depot have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past six months (+11.1% vs. +8.8%). The company has been witnessing benefits from the execution of the “One Home Depot” investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience.\r\n\r\nThe interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters. It on track with its strategic investments to build a Pro ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHowever, Home Depot's top and bottom-lines declined year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Results were impacted by a deflation in lumber and copper and pressures from softness in big-ticket discretionary categories, which weighed on comps.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)\r\n\r\nMerck shares have gained +13.1% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +20.5%. The company’s products like Keytruda and Gardasil have been driving sales. With continued label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver.\r\n\r\nAnimal health and vaccine products are core growth drivers. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should drive long-term growth. Merck is investing in M&A activity to strengthen its pipeline.\r\n\r\nHowever, generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure, mainly on the diabetes franchise, will continue to be overhangs on the top line. There are concerns about Merck’s ability to grow its non-oncology business ahead of Keytruda’s loss of exclusivity later in the decade.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) and Accenture plc (ACN).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the bedding industry and head over directly to the 5 Highest Quality Down Comforter Brands in the US.\n\nGetting into a cozy and comfortable soft bed at the end of a busy day is a pleasure that increases by two folds with the addition of a high-quality comforter, which not only adds to the appeal of your bedroom but also crafts a sense of tranquility. These plush and fluffy layers are meticulously created from the feathers of ducks and geese, and are known for being durable and warm.\n\nThe global comforters market was valued at $3.8 billion in 2021, and is projected to touch $6.9 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 6.15%. According to Business Research Insights, bedding and comforter spending has increased since the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by a higher than anticipated demand for several reasons, ranging from people experiencing sleeping problems during the pandemic because of shifting schedules to the advent of work-from-home culture which refocused budgets of people on buying products to enhance their comfort levels at home. Moreover, since the pandemic, consumers have also begun showing increased interest in self-care products.\n\nComforters are a small segment of the larger bedding industry, which was estimated to be worth around $102 billion in the world in 2023, and is projected to cross $212 billion by 2033.

While best-known for mattresses, their comforters are built with ultra-fine modal fabric to provide silk-like softness and absorb moisture to eliminate any sweat, and keep you dry and cool during sleep. Moreover, Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (NYSE:TPX) also offers elevated, adjustable bed bases that can take various positions to help you sleep better.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Brooklinen’s all-season down comforters make you feel like you are in a cloud, with their light and soft shell, which compresses as you sleep over it, but re-fluffs as soon as you shake. Moreover, several comforters now, including the ones produced by Slumber Cloud, come with NASA Temperature Regulation Technology that regulate body temperature to help you sleep better.\n\nAnother prominent name in the industry is the consumer retail corporation Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

Apart from comforters, Pottery Barn is also well known for its duvets when it comes to bedding products. Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

(NYSE:WSM), which sells kitchenware and home furnishings, was the top contributor in the quarter after its August earnings report showed exceptional profitability and the company raised its full-year guidance. Shares jumped further in September after a private equity firm increased its stake, suggesting recent weakness was overdone. The company’s high-quality fundamentals make it a good defensive fit for an uncertain environment: it generates significant free cash flows, has no debt and the liquidity to invest in the business first and then return excess to shareholders. 12 Highest Quality Down Comforter Brands in the US\n\nA satisfied customer sleeping on a comfortable bed, bedding products laid out on the bed.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have used consensus methodology to rank the highest quality down comforter brands in the US, by seeing what brands were listed for their quality and comfort on seven websites – TIME, CNN, The New York Times, Business Insider, US News, Self, and Cosmopolitan.\n\nScores were assigned to each brand depending on the number of times they were listed on these websites.

        "title": "Pick These 4 Stocks With Amazing Interest Coverage Ratio",
        "content": "Given the current economic scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. Well, you can decide to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. However, such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market faces a myriad of issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.\r\n\r\nWell, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here, we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.\r\n\r\nInterest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.\r\n\r\nMolina Healthcare, Inc. MOH, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Option Care Health, Inc. OPCH are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.\n\nWhy Interest Coverage Ratio?\n\nThe interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.\r\n\r\nDebt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on a company's profits. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the essential criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.\r\n\r\nThe interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.\r\n\r\nAn interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. One should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s the Strategy?\n\nApart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.\r\n\r\nInterest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry Median\r\n\r\nPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.\r\n\r\n5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.\r\n\r\nProjected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nVGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nHere are four of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nMolina Healthcare, which provides managed healthcare services under the Medicaid and Medicare programs and through the state insurance marketplaces, carries a Zacks Rank #2.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — France's privacy watchdog said Tuesday that it slapped Amazon 's French warehouse business with a 32 million euro fine ($35 million) for using an “excessively intrusive sytem” to monitor worker performance and activity.\n\nThe French Data Protection Authority, also known by its acronym CNIL, said the system allowed managers at Amazon France Logistique to track employees so closely that it resulted in multiple breaches of the European Union's stringent privacy rules, called the General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n“We strongly disagree with the CNIL’s conclusions, which are factually incorrect, and we reserve the right to file an appeal,\" Amazon said. \"Warehouse management systems are industry standard and are necessary for ensuring the safety, quality and efficiency of operations and to track the storage of inventory and processing of packages on time and in line with customer expectations.”\n\nThe watchdog's investigation focused on Amazon employees’ use of handheld barcode scanners to track packages at various points as they move through the warehouse, such as putting them in crates or packing them for delivery.\n\nAmazon uses the system to manage its business and meet performance targets, but the regulator said it's different from traditional methods for monitoring worker activity and puts them under “close surveillance” and \"continuous pressure.\"\n\nThe watchdog said the scanner, known as a “stow machine gun,” allows the company to monitor employees to the “nearest second” because they signal an error if items are scanned too quickly — in less than 1.25 seconds.\n\nThe system is used to measure employee productivity as well as “periods of inactivity,” but under EU privacy rules, “it was illegal to set up a system measuring work interruptions with such accuracy, potentially requiring employees to justify every break or interruption,\" the watchdog said.\n\nThe CNIL also chastised Amazon for keeping employee data for too long, saying it didn't need “every detail of the data” generated by the scanners from the past month because real-time data and weekly statistics were enough.",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 30 cities with highest average salary in the US. We have also discussed the growing economic importance of smaller cities. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Cities With Highest Average Salary in the US.\n\nIn a shift away from traditional tech hubs, recent data from job and internship platform Handshake reveals an interesting trend among young workers seeking tech jobs in smaller US cities. Columbia, Maryland, leads the list with 190% year-over-year increase in job applications, followed closely by Boise, Idaho, at 116%. The appeal of these cities lies in factors such as lower living costs, diverse industry opportunities, and less stressful commutes.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)'s $15 billion manufacturing facility and acquisitions of local companies in Boise. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)’s expansion is expected to create 17,000 jobs by 2030, contributing further to the appeal of Boise as a city.\n\nOn the other hand, a transformative $100 billion investment in Syracuse, New York is aimed at turning the city into a high-tech hub. The investment is part of the CHIPS and Science Act which is essentially a government initiative to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) plans to build up to four semiconductor manufacturing facilities (fabs) over the next 20 years, creating 50,000 jobs in the region.\n\nThe top 10 cities attracting tech talent also include Fairfax, Virginia (103% increase), and Madison, Wisconsin (60% increase). These mid-sized cities are witnessing a huge increase in interest and hence, present a departure from the declining applications observed in major tech hubs like California, Washington, and New York.\n\nApart from the tech-oriented viewpoint, Glassdoor's recent research reveals the top 10 US cities where employees are most satisfied with their jobs.

Notably, in the last decade, no other private company has generated more jobs than Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nAdditionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s commitment to creating opportunities extends beyond urban centers, as two out of every five jobs created by the company are situated in small towns.

        "title": "25 Entry-Level High Paying Jobs With Low/No Experience",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 entry-level high paying jobs with low/no experience. We have also discussed the threats for entry level jobs. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Entry-Level High Paying Jobs With Low/No Experience.\n\nA recent report indicates that nearly 40% of American employers are hesitant to hire recent college graduates, particularly those belonging to Generation Z (Gen Z), born between 1997 and 2012. It revealed that 38% of 800 surveyed directors, managers, and executives prefer hiring older workers. Approximately 20% of employers reported instances where young job seekers brought a parent to a job interview, while nearly 60% believed recent college graduates are ill-prepared for the workforce, with half having to terminate employment due to various reasons, such as an inability to handle criticism.\n\nAs a result of negative experiences with younger workers, over half of the business leaders surveyed are implementing policies catering to the preferences of older workers, like offering attractive benefits, higher salaries, and the option to work from home. To read more about jobs for older workers, see our article about the Part-Time Jobs For Seniors That Pay Daily or Weekly.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AI poses a threat to entry-level jobs as automation increasingly replaces routine tasks. For instance, in customer service, chatbots powered by AI can handle basic queries, reducing the need for entry-level support roles. Similarly, in manufacturing, robots and AI-driven systems can perform repetitive tasks, impacting entry-level assembly line positions. Similarly, administrative roles face challenges too, as AI algorithms can streamline data analysis and processing, diminishing the demand for entry-level data entry positions.\n\nIn 2023, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s CEO Arvind Krishna announced a hiring freeze as the company anticipated the replacement of approximately 7,800 jobs with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the next five years. In an interview with Bloomberg News, the CEO revealed that nearly one-third of International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s non-customer-facing roles, totaling around 26,000 positions, could be automated. Despite having already let go of 5,000 workers in other areas,  International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s spokesperson clarified that there was no blanket hiring pause, but the company is selectively filling roles not directly related to clients or technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs AI-powered technology, including platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, advances rapidly, fears of widespread job disruption are surfacing. Analysts are divided on the potential consequences, with some predicting mass layoffs while others believe AI will enhance productivity and create new job opportunities. Notably, the acknowledgement of ChatGPT's impact on customer growth led to a nearly 50% plunge in the share price of California-based learning company Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG). The tech industry is navigating the delicate balance between the benefits and challenges posed by AI integration and thus, sparking debates about its role in shaping the future of work.\n\nInterestingly, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)’s global managing partner for generative AI, Matthew Candy, predicts that AI will revolutionize the tech industry, making a computer science degree less essential. According to Candy, the acceleration of idea generation and product development facilitated by AI means that individuals without technical backgrounds can now easily contribute to tech innovation. He highlighted the increasing importance of soft skills such as critical thinking, questioning, creativity, and innovation in the tech landscape.

In a recent wave of tech layoffs in 2024, several major companies, like Wayfair Inc (NYSE:W), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Duolingo Inc (NASDAQ:DUOL), and others, have announced huge workforce reductions.\n\nWayfair Inc (NYSE:W), a furniture e-commerce company, is cutting 13% of its workforce, amounting to 1,650 jobs, following a similar pattern from the previous year. Other notable layoffs include Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) shedding 2,350 jobs, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) implementing cuts in its global advertising and sales teams, Twitch reducing 35% of its staff, and Duolingo Inc (NASDAQ:DUOL) slashing 10% of its contract employees.\n\nAccording to layoff.fyi, the scale of job cuts in January, though significant, is notably lower than the previous year, with 37 tech companies in january 2024 making layoffs compared to 278 in the same period last year. Despite this, the cumulative impact of major US layoffs in 2023 exceeded 305,000 employees, with high-profile cases such as Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) cutting 8,000 jobs in January 2023 and another 9,000 in November. The current tech layoffs speaks volumes a broader trend of companies optimizing their workforces and reducing costs in response to economic uncertainties and strategic shifts which impact a number of sectors like e-commerce, technology, and entertainment.\n\nRecently, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a 5% reduction in its workforce at the Buy with Prime unit, affecting approximately 30 employees, as reported on January 18, 2024. Despite the job cuts, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) promises that the unit remains a top priority, with a commitment to continue investing resources. The company is actively assisting the laid-off staff in securing roles both within and outside the organization. 25 Entry-Level High Paying Jobs With Low/No Experience\n\nCopyright: nateemee / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nA consensus-based approach was adopted to determine the ranking of high-paying jobs with low to no experience required.

        "content": "Amazon has been fined 32 million euros (£27 million) in France for what the country’s data watchdog called “excessive” surveillance of its warehouse workers.\n\nThe CNIL has imposed the fine on Amazon France Logistique, which manages the e-commerce giant’s warehouses, over the data recorded by handheld scanners used by staff.\n\nThe watchdog said the implementation of the system measured interruptions in activity so precisely that it led workers to have to justify each break or interruption, and was in fact illegal.\n\nThe CNIL called the system “excessive” and also raised concerns over Amazon keeping the data collected on workers for 31 days.\n\nℹ️🔴 The CNIL fined AMAZON FRANCE LOGISTIQUE €32 million for setting up an excessively intrusive system for monitoring employee activity and performance.

Related to this theme, Cramer talked about his expectations for this year and said that he's expecting a few stocks from the Magnificent Seven group to fall from their 2023 glory. Some Mag. 7 stocks Cramer has been recommending investors in 2023 include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nCramer Expects a Difficult 2024 for Tesla\n\nCramer said that Tesla will be first to go down in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks.

From these stocks we picked stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. We used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of billionaires and their stock holdings to find the number of billionaire investors for these companies\n\nStory continues\n\n11. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 6\n\nJim Cramer has long been bearish on Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) and recommending investors to stay away from this stock. Recently, Jim Cramer made the following comment about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT):\n\n\"Let’s stop fooling around. If you want bitcoin, buy bitcoin. I think bitcoin’s topping out, by the way, so I’m going to say, enough is enough and ka-ching is ka-ching.”\n\nIn November 2023, Jim Cramer had said that Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) does not make any money and investors should own Bitcoin directly if they want to get exposure to crypto.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of billionaires shows that six billionaires had stakes in Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT).\n\nJim Cramer is bearish on RIOT but recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n10.

These are both new materials used as a base (substrate) on which to print power-oriented chip circuits. Shares fell during the quarter as the stock was trading at a premium valuation heading into the quarter, and investors were broadly concerned about underlying demand conditions in key end-markets like smartphones. Despite near-term concerns, the company reiterated its outlook to double revenues in 2023, reported strong design win momentum, and indicated opportunity pipeline growth. Navitas sells monolithically integrated GaN power integrated circuit chips (completed printed circuit systems on a chip), which provide greater reliability and performance compared to competitors that supply discrete power devices (multiple individual, larger components put together on a chip). It recently purchased a silicon control company to drive integration and performance even further, and its SiC products offer high performance across many different applications. The company’s high-power GaN product launches remain on track for data center, solar, and electric vehicle applications. We expect Navitas to gain share in the rapidly growing GaN and SiC power semiconductor markets over time, driven by its superior technology.”\n\n9.

(NYSE:TDW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Finally, long-time holding, offshore oil services company, Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) rose 31% in the quarter, as more investors and operators recognized the importance of investing in fossil fuels to sustain long-term economic growth and national security. In a challenging environment for most asset classes, Energy was a considerable outperformer this past quarter, illustrating the potency of the investor pivot.”\n\n8. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 7\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Jim Cramer recommended investors to stay away from  solid state lithium battery company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS).

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Casey's General Stores, Target, Amazon.com and American Eagle Outfitters",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY, Target Corp. TGT, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Retail Stocks to Play the Surge in Consumer Sentiment\n\nIn a promising turn of events, January has seen a remarkable surge in U.S. consumer sentiment, reaching its highest level in two and a half years. The University of Michigan's recent report indicates an upswing in optimism. This surge in sentiment comes hand in hand with a decline in inflation expectations, signaling a potential shift in the economic landscape.\n\nThe University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment for January stands at an impressive 78.8, the highest since July 2021 and a significant leap from December's 69.7. This unexpected positive turn is occurring against a backdrop of a robust stock market, a healthy job market and stable gasoline prices.\n\nOne of the key takeaways is the decline in consumers' inflation expectations for the next 12 months to 2.9%, the lowest level since December 2020. This shift in expectations, down from 3.1% in December, aligns with a range observed before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prospect of lower inflation is welcomed news for the Federal Reserve, potentially opening the door for interest rate cuts in the coming months.\n\nThis surge in confidence could play a pivotal role in allaying fears of an impending recession. Despite inflation and high interest rate concerns, Americans maintained a spending spree driven by strong employment and wage gains.\n\nInvestors, in light of these positive developments, should consider strategic opportunities in the market. Sectors that traditionally thrive in times of economic optimism, such as retail, may present compelling investment avenues. As inflation expectations ease and consumer sentiment continues to improve, astute investors may find opportunities to capitalize on a more positive economic outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\n4 Prominent Picks\n\nCasey's General Stores, Inc. is a potential pick. Casey's price and product optimization strategies, increased penetration of private brands and digital engagements comprising the mobile app and online ordering capabilities are commendable. As the third-largest convenience retailer and the fifth-largest pizza chain, its distinctive self-distribution model, robust Inside category performance and strategic acquisitions are noteworthy strengths.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Casey's current fiscal sales and EPS suggests growth of 0.3% and 9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 17.8%, on average. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nInvestors can count on Target Corp.. This Minneapolis, MN-based company has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the dynamic retail landscape. Target has been deploying resources to enhance omnichannel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. These have been contributing to the top line.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Target's current financial-year EPS suggests growth of 38.5% from the year-ago reported figure. TGT, which sports a Zacks Rank #1, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 30.8%, on average.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is worth considering. The company's robust e-commerce platform, renowned for its vast product selection and efficient delivery services, continues to be a primary driver of revenue growth. Prime membership, a cornerstone of Amazon's success, not only fosters customer loyalty but also drives recurring revenues through subscription fees, offering members exclusive access to a myriad of services, such as expedited shipping.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon's current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 11.1% and 278.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. AMZN, which sports a Zacks Rank #1, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 54.9%, on average.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters, Inc. is worth betting on. The company's efforts to rationalize inventory and contain costs are paying off. The strong performance of key brands like American Eagle and Aerie, coupled with expansions into premium and activewear segments, indicates potential for growth. Its store designs and online enhancements demonstrate a commitment to improving the customer experience.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Eagle Outfitters' current fiscal sales and EPS suggests growth of 5% and 43.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. AEO, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 23%, on average.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, NVIDIA NVDA, Salesforce CRM, and Amazon.com AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 S&P 500 Growth Stocks to Buy as Index Enjoys Bull Market\n\nThe S&P 500 bounced back in 2023 after taking a beating in the prior year, gaining an encouraging 24% as steady economic growth squashed any expectations of an impending recession, while price pressures came down to levels that compelled the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 was off to a rough start in 2024 as market participants took some profits in tech bigwigs such as Apple Inc.. But they recently returned to buy back those magnificent tech players, helping the S&P 500 enter a bull market. The broader index has soared more than 35% from its October 2022 low.\n\nFor the first time, the S&P 500 finished at a record close, in more than two years. The index has also set an intraday record high after gyrating in a tight trading range for nearly a month. The large-cap benchmark closed at 4,839.81 on Jan 19 and exceeded the previous record close of 4,796.56 achieved on Jan 3, 2022. Additionally, the index hit an intraday high of 4,842.07, easily topping the intraday record of 4,818.62 attained on Jan 4, 2022, per FactSet data.\n\nNow, bull markets generally tend to last for quite some time. The previous bull market that started in March 2020 continued for less than two years. What's more, the bull market that began before that prevailed for almost 10 years. It began from the Great Recession period till the outbreak of the coronavirus in February 2020. Similarly, the current bull market is expected to continue as stocks gain momentum, banking on a less hawkish Fed, upbeat consumer sentiment, and uptick in tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs inflation has started to show signs of cooling down, the Fed has kept its interest rates unchanged in the last meeting and is widely expected to trim rates this year. Interest rate cuts are always a boon for the stock market as they boost consumer outlays, decrease the cost of borrowings, and pep up the economy (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates in 2024).\n\nAmericans are anyhow feeling much more optimistic about the current and future business scenarios, thanks to the strength in the labor market. The University of Michigan stated that its consumer sentiment index surged 21.4% year over year in January and touched its highest level since July 2021. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, too, had touched the highest level in December since July (read more: Raise a Toast to These 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks in 2024).\n\nTech stocks, meanwhile, are gaining traction due to AI optimism. Taiwan Semiconductor's latest upbeat earnings report also bolstered confidence for the chip sector. Gains in mega-cap tech stocks eventually erased the S&P 500's 2024 losses. Hence, with the S&P 500 scaling upward, it's prudent for astute investors to place bets on growth stocks listed in the index.\n\nSome of the prominent names are NVIDIA, Salesforce, and Amazon.com. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 12.9% over the past 60 days. NVDA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268.6%.\n\nSalesforce is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Salesforce currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. CRM's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 56.5%.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.8% over the past 60 days. AMZN's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 278.9%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 5 Top Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Investing is a long-term game. You win by finding great companies and then buying and holding them. Your investment will grow in value as the underlying businesses grow.\n\nSo, how do you apply that mindset to technology stocks, where it's often a matter of disrupting your competition or being disrupted? It can be tricky, but there are bonafide winners with the size and fundamentals to continue thriving for years.\n\nHere are five of the very best companies in the tech sector. Consider adding these to a diversified portfolio, and you'll get richer while sleeping well at night.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a hot trend on Wall Street. Still, AI will likely grow and develop over the coming decades. Chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has quickly established itself as the chip kingpin of this new era. Its graphics processing chips specialize in demanding applications, and that natural fit catapulted the company to an estimated AI chip market share between 80% and 95%.\n\nIt's hard to see Nvidia completely losing that market share, even if competitors chip away at it over time. The companies investing in AI are spending billions of dollars, which could make it harder to get them to switch from what's already working. AI unlocked a new level of growth at Nvidia last year, but AI's long-term potential means that the stock should enjoy years of growth.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nModern technology is built on the cloud -- centralized servers and data centers that shift computing power off organizations' premises. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) might have built its reputation on e-commerce, but its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, is the world's leader. That makes the stock a no-brainer long-term buy and hold.\n\nToday, Amazon holds nearly a third of the global cloud platform market, meaning that most of your online web activity at least touches AWS at one point or another. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow by 20% annually through the decade's end, which will almost certainly trickle to AWS. Add in Amazon's other business units, and the future looks bright.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nData has arguably become the critical resource companies and governments crave in this modern world. Data helps companies know their customers, themselves, and their competitors. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has arguably the most data of any company on Earth thanks to its decades of dominance in Google Search and YouTube. These are the world's two most heavily trafficked sites.\n\nFor investors, Alphabet's massive audience gives it many billions of dollars in high-margin advertising revenue, which helped the company bring in over $77 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months alone. The company's data, deep pockets, and AI potential mean that Alphabet will likely leverage itself into years of growth ahead.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nSocial media has become a regular part of daily life for people worldwide, and nobody does it better than Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). The company owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, making money by showing ads to the 3.96 billion people using its apps monthly. The company's a cash cow, generating $37 billion in cash flow over the past year, and invests heavily into new opportunities, like AI and the metaverse via Reality Labs.\n\nStudies have shown that social media is addictive, which, admittedly, probably isn't great for its users' mental health but makes Meta Platforms' core business very sticky. While many of the world's largest companies are led by outsiders, Meta is still headed by its co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who is only 39. He's built the company into the tech giant it is today, so long-term investors should feel great about Meta's future.\n\n5. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCybersecurity has become one of the most critical pieces of any corporate budget. Getting hacked or suffering a data breach can cost a company millions in financial and reputational damage. CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) is part of a new generation of security companies, leaning on AI and cloud technology to provide security that learns in real-time, something legacy solutions like antivirus software can't match.\n\nCrowdStrike is by far the youngest company on this list, but it's established itself as a leader in its field. Notably, the business is already quite profitable despite still chasing revenue growth. More than 23,000 organizations use CrowdStrike, which sells its products in modules. Customers buy access to more modules as CrowdStrike expands its offerings, leading to durable growth from adding new customers and cross-selling to existing ones. Cybersecurity isn't going anywhere, making CrowdStrike a security leader to hold onto.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "If you got sick of all the artificial intelligence (AI) talk in 2023, you should know it probably won't lessen in 2024. With some saying AI and machine learning (ML) could be as transformational to business as the internet, it's best to roll with it. Especially because the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes AI will impact 40% of jobs globally.\n\nAI/ML is an expansive area, so it may be tough to know where to start. Just a few examples of the technology include:\n\nSpeech recognition (great for automobiles and drive-thru kiosks) Chatbots (terrific for online customer service and many other functions) Cybersecurity applications Virtual assistants Autonomous vehicles Factory robotics Medical research and diagnosis\n\nWhile the arena is massive, there are a few popular companies investors should know right off the bat. I'll start right at the top with heavyweights Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and then up-and-comers like Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) and UiPath(NYSE: PATH).\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia is among the most important companies because of its high-powered, essential data center hardware and software. Without Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and other products, AI applications would be difficult to execute. This has brought the company incredible success, which the infographic below depicts. NVDA INFOGRAPHIC\n\nFirst, we can see that total revenue increased 205% year over year (YOY) to $18 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 on the back of data center revenue, which increased 278% to $14.5 billion -- a ridiculous clip. Even more incredible, data center growth accelerated in Q3 of fiscal year 2024, eclipsing 171% in Q2.\n\nThe next major takeaway is the company's operating income (center of the graphic). It soared 1,633% to $10.4 billion on a 57% margin. Nvidia's profits skyrocketed because demand was higher than supply. They cannot produce enough to satisfy their customers, so they have pricing power.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has some challenges, like U.S. restrictions on exports to China and competition working hard; however, Nvidia creates new chips that meet export requirements to China, and it has a significant head start on competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\n\nTrading at 74 times earnings, the stock isn't cheap and likely won't be anytime soon. This drops to 46x on a forward basis (compared to Microsoft at 35x), which is more palatable. NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nWall Street has a history of underestimating Nvidia's future earnings. Still, be cautious at the current price or consider dollar-cost averaging.\n\nAlphabet\n\nIn late 2022, Alphabet found itself caught flat-footed when OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the stage, and Microsoft invested billions to bring the generative AI tech to Bing. Suddenly, there was serious competition for Google Search -- Alphabet's gravy train that produced $127 billion in revenue through Q3 2023, 57% of the company's total sales.\n\nLuckily, Alphabet has studied AI for years and has many solutions that have come out or are coming soon. There is Bard, Alphabet's answer to ChatGPT. Alphabet recently upgraded Bard with its Gemini tech to enhance its performance.\n\nGoogle Search has new features that allow users to search with a picture, optimize translation services, and provide more relevant results. The company developed its own chip, the tensor processing unit (TPU), for generative AI applications. Perhaps the ChatGPT release was the kick in the pants Alphabet needed to get its AI program to the market.\n\nAlphabet's sales are up 7% YOY through Q3 2023 to $221 billion; however, growth accelerated to 11% in the last quarter. More impressively, cash from operations is up 22% this year, reaching $83 billion to show that Alphabet is still a cash-flow machine. The stock is fairly valued, trading close to its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon is among the most exciting AI companies because it benefits from AI on multiple fronts. Generative AI software requires massive data processing, much of which runs through the cloud. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest provider of cloud services. Growth at AWS slowed in 2023 because companies cut their data usage budgets in anticipation of a recession, but AI and increased budgets could turn this around in 2024.\n\nThe company also uses AI in digital advertising and logistics, and Amazon Bedrock provides foundational models for companies to tailor AI applications to their needs.\n\nWhile AWS growth slowed in 2023, areas like digital advertising thrived, and Amazon grew total revenue by 11% through Q3 2023 to $405 billion. Positive free cash flow and net income also returned after a difficult 2022.\n\nThe stock trades well below its recent averages based on operating cash flow and sales, as shown below. AMZN PS Ratio data by YCharts. CFO = cash flow from operations. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio.\n\nThe valuation and opportunity make Amazon stock an alluring buy.\n\nPalantir\n\nPalantir has been unapologetically hyping its AI prowess since before AI was the thing to be. The company helps governments and businesses manage, analyze, visualize, and act on data. It also provides a platform where clients can build and deploy applications, and its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software expands on this by using AI to enhance logical decision-making.\n\nPalantir is a critical partner in the defense industry and is making strides in the private sector. Last quarter, private sector sales increased 23% YOY to $251 million, while government sales grew 12% to $308 million. Palantir also achieved its fourth straight quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits, has $3.3 billion in cash and investments, and has no long-term debt. It's no wonder it's a popular stock. Still, its 17% YOY growth last quarter may not justify its current valuation of 17x sales.\n\nUiPath\n\nUiPath is getting some well-deserved attention lately. The company is a leader in robotic process automation (RPA). RPA has many use cases that get to the heart of AI/ML: efficiency.\n\nFor instance, picture a large company that receives hundreds of invoices daily through email. Instead of manually downloading and inputting them (as is the case now), RPA does this automatically with minimal human intervention. This is why UiPath reported $1.4 billion annual recurring revenue on 24% growth and over 10,800 customers last quarter.\n\nThere is intense industry competition, namely from Microsoft, which gives investors pause. However, the company is on firm financial footing, reporting $1.75 billion in cash and investments with no long-term debt, and trades for just 10x sales. This makes UiPath a very compelling stock for growth-oriented investors.\n\nMany terrific companies are doing innovative things in AI. Of these popular companies, I think Amazon and UiPath are the most intriguing buys based on potential and valuation; however, each name has a lot to like.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

        "title": "My Top 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Now in 2024 and Hold Long Term",
        "content": "Grand View Research estimates that spending across artificial intelligence (AI) hardware, software, and services will compound at 37% annually through 2030. That creates a significant opportunity for investors. Businesses are racing to improve productivity with predictive insights and automation, and that secular trend should drive many stocks higher in 2024 and beyond.\n\nThe most prudent way to capitalize on that trend is to build a basket of AI stocks. Here's why now is a good time to add shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG) to that basket.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in running complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The company has regularly achieved top scores at the MLPerf benchmarks, the industry standard in benchmarking the performance of machine learning (ML) hardware, software, and services across training and inference use cases. And Nvidia holds more than 80% market share in AI/ML chips, according to analysts.\n\nHowever, the company is truly formidable because of its full-stack strategy. To elaborate, Nvidia has extended its data center hardware portfolio to include networking equipment and central processing units (CPUs) purpose-built for AI, and both have become multibillion-dollar businesses. The company has also branched into subscription software and cloud services to simplify the development of AI applications, and those products have become a billion-dollar business.\n\nManagement sees those three adjacencies -- networking, CPUs, and software and services -- as key growth drivers because they extend its ability to monetize AI. Additionally, with products addressing every layer of the AI stack -- infrastructure, software, and services -- Nvidia is an even more compelling option for businesses. To that end, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino believes its \"full-stack AI/software capabilities provide an incredible competitive advantage.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGrand View Research expects the GPU market to grow roughly 28% annually through 2030. When coupled with growth in other AI spending categories, that tailwind could translate into annual sales growth above 25% for Nvidia, which makes its current valuation of 30.9 times sales seem tolerable.\n\nAs a caveat, that multiple is a premium to the three-year average of 23.5 times sales, but investors with a five-year time horizon should still consider buying a small position today. Nvidia will probably command a premium valuation for the foreseeable future.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe, and it has become the third-largest ad tech company in the world. The company is using AI to make both businesses more efficient and profitable. For instance, Amazon uses ML models to optimize inventory and logistics routes, and it recently launched a generative AI tool that helps brands create marketing content.\n\nHowever, Amazon is truly primed to monetize AI because it has a dominant position in cloud computing. Indeed, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for 32% of cloud infrastructure and platform services in the most recent quarter, while its closest competitor, Microsoft Azure, held 23% market share. That means AWS is arguably the cloud provider best positioned to support businesses as they experiment with AI, and its status as a leader in cloud AI developer services makes that argument even more credible.\n\nAdditionally, AWS has launched new generative AI products. Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service that supports the development of generative AI applications. And Code Whisperer is an AI-enabled copilot for software developers. The company also announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant that can automate tasks and surface insights across a range of systems and data sources, including external products from Microsoft and Salesforce.\n\nWith that in mind, Morningstar analysts expect Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually through 2027, driven by particularly strong momentum in digital advertising and cloud computing. That estimate makes its current valuation of 2.8 times sales seem fair, especially when the three-year average is 3 times sales.\n\n3. Datadog\n\nDatadog provides observability and cybersecurity software that helps businesses monitor IT infrastructure and resolve performance issues. Its platform leans on AI to surface insights, detect anomalies, and automate root cause analysis. Datadog is a recognized leader in several software verticals, including application performance monitoring, log monitoring, and AI for IT operations.\n\nObservability software becomes increasingly essential as IT environments become more complex. That means digital transformation projects, like cloud migration and AI deployment, are tailwinds for Datadog. But the company has further cemented its ability to monetize AI with two new products.\n\nFirst, LLM Observability is a performance monitoring solution for generative AI applications and the underlying large language models. Second, Bits AI is a conversational copilot that helps development and operations teams investigate and resolve problems more quickly.\n\nDatadog expects its addressable market to increase at 11% annually to reach $62 billion in 2026, but the company should grow much faster. In fact, Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin believes Datadog could become the \"fastest growing software company\" as the generative AI boom unfolds, and the Wall Street consensus calls for sales to increase at 26% annually over the next five years. That outlook makes its current valuation of 20.6 times sales seem reasonable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "18 High Growth Low PE Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the18 High Growth Low PE Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 High Growth Low PE Stocks.\n\nWhen value stocks came back with a vengeance in 2022, value investors cheered what they thought was the beginning of a long bull run of value stocks. But thanks to the AI boom, growth stocks rebounded in 2023. In a ten-year period ending 2021, the Russell Growth 1000 Index doubled the performance of the Russell 1000 Value Index. The so-called 'value investing' strategy has taken a hit amid an unending growth of technology stocks. But over the years the traditional boundaries between value and growth investing have faded. In fact, successful investors like Warren Buffett have long been saying that differentiating between value and growth does not make sense as they see growth a part of the broader value investing philosophy. Warren Buffett once said:\n\n\"There is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks as Wall Street generally portrays them, as contrasting asset classes. Growth is part of the value equation.”\n\nThere was a time Buffett stayed away from tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) saying he did not understand business models of these companies. But today he has huge stakes in some of the top tech companies in the US.\n\nRelying totally on PE ratios without paying attention to fundamentals and growth of companies is also not useful. For example, Oakmark in its September 2023 report on Value Vs Growth said the following which shows the importance of paying attention to both value multiples and growth metrics before making investment decisions:\n\n\"When we compare the 50 lowest ranked companies by P/E ratio on the S&P 500 today to the ones that made that list in previous periods, we don’t observe any decline in business quality. Therefore, considering both the relatively high price of the higher P/E companies and the solid business quality of the lower P/E companies—we believe that low P/E stocks today present a better hunting ground than they normally do. Last year we bought depressed stocks of high- growth businesses, such as Uber, at a double-digit free cash flow yield; Workday at a low price relative to sales; and Adobe at only a slightly higher than average P/E ratio. This year, after strong outperformance, we sold them and bought much lower P/E stocks. Here’s a fun way to think of it: In 2022, we bought a share of Adobe for about three shares of CVS Health. (CVS was just under $100 and Adobe under $300). This year we sold Adobe to buy more than six shares of CVS. (Adobe increased to well over $400 and CVS fell to $70.) We thought Adobe was cheap when we bought it, despite it being a high-growth business, and that CVS was fully priced when we sold it, despite it having a below-average P/E ratio.\"\n\nStory continues High Growth Low PE Stocks\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with PE ratios less than 15 and high revenue growth (over 25%) over the past five years and also in the most recent quarters. From these stocks we selected 18 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "title": "3 Promising Stocks With Newly Announced Dividend Hikes",
        "content": "Last year was a good year for dividend investors. Some 850 companies announced they were raising their payout with the average increase exceeding 12%. Studies have found stocks that initiated and then raised their payouts handily outperformed non-dividend paying companies. J.P. Morgan Asset Management discovered that over the 40 years between 1972 and 2012, dividend-raisers returned an average of 9.5% annually versus just 1.6% non-dividend-paying stocks. This has led to some very promising stocks.\n\nYet it was a rather disappointing year for dividend stock royalty. Dividend Aristocrats, or S&P 500 stocks that have raised their payout for 25 years or more, only increased their payouts by an average of 5% last year. Performance was also lackluster. The ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSE:NOBL) produced a total return of just 8% for all of last year compared to 26% by the benchmark index.\n\nStill, investing in dividend stocks is a smart choice. There has never been a decade going back to the 1930s when dividend stocks in the S&P 500 didn’t have positive returns. That includes through the Great Depression and the 2000s, the so-called “lost decade.” Dividend stocks always managed to produce growth for investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three solid stocks with recent dividend increases. Income investors should enjoy excellent returns in 2024 and beyond by buying them today.\n\nFastenal (FAST)\n\nSource: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.com\n\nFastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) is boring. It sells fasteners, small parts, and tools to industrial and construction companies. But it’s a growing business and a profitable one that generates operating margins north of 20% annually. Its dividend is rising almost just as fast. Over the past decade the payout rose from $0.125 per share to its just-announced $0.39 per share, a 12% compounded annual increase. The latest hike was 11.4%, not including the special dividend it paid in December.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs it marks the 25th consecutive year of raising its dividend, Fastenal will become the latest addition to Dividend Aristocrats. You might want to make it an addition to your portfolio, too. However, there are several things to understand. First, it’s a cyclical business. Fastenal recently pointed to a slowing economy with the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) marking its 14th consecutive month below 50. Anything below that level indicates an economy contracting; above that is expansion. However, that resulted in daily sales growth of just 3.7%, the lowest level since the pandemic. Moreover, it also indicates just how fast business grew when the economy reopened.\n\nIt’s not affecting Fastenal stock though. Shares are up 45% in the past year. Although the stock is not cheap, a market downturn could create a buying opportunity. It’s a stock you may want to buy anyway as it is a great long-term pick with plenty of growth still to come.\n\nSTAG Industrial (STAG) stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes D\n\nSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com\n\nReal estate investment trust STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG) is a different kind of REIT. Rather than investing in single-family home mortgages or even office space, STAG Industrial focuses on single-tenant light industrial buildings. Most are warehouses or distribution facilities. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is its largest tenant accounting for 3% of total space. The rise of e-commerce has allowed business to boom. It also allowed STAG to dramatically increase rents.\n\nThe REIT noted in the third quarter that the push of e-commerce for facilities allowed it to double the rent on its warehouses. Overall it was able to increase rents on expiring leases by 54.2%. It has 112 million square feet of space across 568 properties, but the rent increases affected just 2.3 million square feet. That suggests as more leases expire over the coming years they will also be brought up to current market rates. It points to healthy growth for years to come.\n\nSTAG Industrial also just announced it was increasing its dividend to $0.123333 per share. Because the REIT pays its investors monthly it equates to an annual dividend of $1.48 per share. Now it doesn’t make big leaps higher with its increases. The typical hike is about a penny per year.\n\nSTAG Industrial has a lot of room to grow and seems to find itself in a sweet spot for investors. It’s raised the payout every year since going public in 2011 and makes an excellent stock to buy, particularly if you like getting paid every month to own shares.\n\nBank OZK (OZK) Image of a grey cityscape with a large corporate building that features the word bank on it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFormerly the Bank of the Ozarks, Bank OZK (NYSE:OZK) is another standout dividend stock. Operating primarily in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the country, the financial stock offers the usual range of services you find at other banks, including loans, deposits, mortgages, wealth management, and trust services. Yet it also specializes in some unique areas such as homeowner association banking services, aircraft loans Small Business Administration loans, and agricultural lending.\n\nThe bank consistently outperforms its peers and the industry benchmarks in terms of efficiency, asset quality, and net interest margin. Bank OZK also sports a high and growing dividend yield of 3.2% annually, which is above the average of its peers and the S&P 500. Not only has it increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years but its increased the payout every quarter for the last 54 quarters. In Q4 it raised the dividend 2.7%. The payout ratio, or the amount of profits it uses to pay the dividend, is also low and stable at 26%, meaning it retains most of its earnings for reinvestment and growth. Bank OZK also has a strong balance sheet with a high capital ratio and low non-performing assets.\n\nThe bank stock has a long, solid track record of growth and profitability, with a 10-year average return on equity of 12.8% and a 15.4% earnings growth rate. With a loyal and growing customer base, high retention rates, and numerous cross-selling opportunities, Bank OZK is a dividend stock you can bank on, and one of the most promising stocks on the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amid the recent favorable price action within the market, many stocks are nearing or breaking 52-week highs, including several highly recognizable names such as Amazon AMZN, Arista Networks ANET, and Abercrombie & Fitch ANF.\n\nIn addition to recent momentum, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting upward earnings estimate revisions among analysts. Let’s take a closer look at each for those seeking to tap into the strength.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon shares have been big-time performers over the last year, outperforming the general market handily and enjoying a spot within the highly-coveted ‘Magnificent 7’ group. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations moving higher across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company is expected to return to its high-growth nature in its current fiscal year, with consensus estimates currently suggesting 280% earnings growth on 11% higher sales. Easing costs have been a notable tailwind for the market titan.\n\nShares aren’t overly expensive given the forecasted growth, currently trading at a 2.5X forward price-to-sales ratio. The present value is well beneath the 3.1X five-year median and highs of 4.8X back in 2020. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nArista Networks\n\nArista Networks shares have benefited nicely from the AI frenzy. The company provides network switches to hyperscalers that speed up communication between computer servers.\n\nThe stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the revisions trend for its current fiscal year particularly strong, up 25% to $6.55 per share over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSimilar to AMZN, the company boasts an impressive growth profile, with consensus estimates for its current fiscal year suggesting 43% earnings growth on 33% higher sales. Growth looks to continue in FY24, as estimates allude to an additional 10% boost in earnings paired with an 11% revenue climb.\n\nKeep an eye out for the company’s next quarterly release scheduled for February 12th, as the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.70 suggests 20% year-over-year growth and has been taken 8% higher since last October.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetter-than-expected quarterly results have helped drive shares higher, as we can see illustrated in the chart below by the green arrows circled. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), operates as a specialty retailer of many types of premium, high-quality casual apparel for men, women, and kids through a vast store network. Earnings expectations have melted higher across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike ANET, the company’s shares have been supported by better-than-expected quarterly results, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, ANF has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 700% across its last four releases.\n\nShares have moved higher post-earnings in three consecutive releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nMomentum has carried over nicely into 2024, with many stocks breaking 52-week highs and undoubtedly pleasing investors.\n\nAnd for those seeking to tap into the strength, all three stocks above – Amazon AMZN, Arista Networks ANET, and Abercrombie & Fitch ANF – could be great considerations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) closed at $154.78 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.36% move from the prior day. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.22%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.36%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.32%.\n\nThe online retailer's shares have seen an increase of 1.25% over the last month, surpassing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 0.36% and falling behind the S&P 500's gain of 1.61%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Amazon in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on February 1, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.79, up 276.19% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $166.19 billion, up 11.38% from the year-ago period.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

        "title": "After Mixed Bank Results and Economic Data, Can Tech Earnings Restore the Calm?",
        "content": "Mixed earnings results and strong economic data out last week induced some market jitters and a VIX that rose to its highest level in over two months.\n\nAfter lackluster big bank results at the kickoff of the fourth-quarter 2023 season, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) started off last week on a more positive note. Both handily beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom-line thanks to year-over-year improvements in asset management, investment banking and equities trading.[1] [2] Smaller U.S. banks, however, didn't fare as well. In order to compete with higher-yielding instruments, regional banks had to increase payouts on deposits to retain customers which lowered Net Interest Income (NII). Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW)[3], U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)[4], PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC)[5] and Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG)[6] all pointed to this in their results. In addition, these banks also saw a hit to the bottom-line from fees paid to the FDIC as they replenish the government insurance fund that was depleted after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last year.\n\nThen there was the better-than-expected jobs and consumer data out last week, continuing the trend of \"good news is bad news.\" On Wednesday, December Retail Sales increased 0.6% versus economists' expectations of 0.4%, pointing to a holiday shopping season that was more robust than previously thought.[7] On Thursday, Weekly Initial Jobless Claims came in at their lowest level since September 2022, showing that a tight labor market is still in play.[8] Markets retreated after both of these reports as investors are likely worried that a hot labor market and resilient consumer may mean fewer rate cuts in 2024. Expectations for a March rate cut dropped to 54% according to the CME FedWatch Tool.[9]\n\nComing to the rescue late in the week, however, were once again the tech stocks. A blowout report from the world's largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)[10], helped push the Nasdaq Composite higher for the week, and into positive territory for the year after getting off to a rough start. Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also added to that boost after Bank of America upgraded the stock to a buy.[11]\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the mixed earnings results from last week, the blended S&P 500 EPS growth rate fell to -1.7% from -0.1% the week prior.[12]\n\nCorporate Uncertainty Eases to the Lowest Level in Nearly 2 Years\n\nEven as the fourth-quarter season gets underway with some shaky results and commentary, our proprietary gauge of corporate uncertainty continues to sport a very low reading. The most recent reading of the Late Earnings Report Index (LERI) shows that fewer companies are delaying earnings reports than advancing them.\n\nThe LERI tracks outlier earnings date changes among publicly traded companies with market capitalizations of $250 million and higher. The LERI has a baseline reading of 100, anything above that indicates companies are feeling uncertain about their current and short-term prospects. A LERI reading under 100 suggests companies feel they have a pretty good crystal ball for the near-term.\n\nThe pre-peak season LERI reading for the fourth quarter (data collected in the first quarter) stands at 74, the lowest reading in nearly two years. As of Jan. 19, there were 55 late outliers and 67 early outliers. This is in stark contrast to the LERI readings from the second and third-quarter earnings seasons, which showed CEOs at their most uncertain since the Covid-19 pandemic. After Mixed Bank Results and Economic Data, Can Tech Earnings Restore the Calm?\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nAcademic research shows, for example, that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier would suggest the opposite.[13]\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an example of a company with an outlier date this week. T-Mobile is set to report Q4 2023 results on Thursday, January 25, six days earlier than expected. For the last two years TMUS has reported Q4 results on a Wednesday in the 5th or 6th week of the year, in the four years prior the company always reported on a Thursday in the 6th week of the year. This will be the first time they have reported in the fourth week of the year, and their earliest Q4 report date ever since they IPO'd in 2013.\n\nOn Deck this Week\n\nThe focus will move beyond financials this week as other sectors start to report their fourth-quarter earnings. Highly anticipated results from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be out Tuesday, Jan. 23 after the market closes. According to analysts polled by Factset, year-over-year EPS growth for Netflix is expected to come in at 1,742%, which would be the second-highest growth rate of any U.S. large-cap company this season after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nA closely watched Magnificent 7 component will also be out, when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reports Wednesday, January 24 AMC. Industrials such as 3M (MMM) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) will also report results, as well as big tech names International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). After Mixed Bank Results and Economic Data, Can Tech Earnings Restore the Calm?\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nQ4 Earnings Wave\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between Jan. 29 and March 1, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Feb. 22 is predicted to be the most active day with 599 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 47% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 10,000+ global names), so this is subject to change. The remaining dates are estimated based on historical reporting data. Keep in mind the Q4 reporting season is always a bit more prolonged, typically stretching over four or five peak weeks rather than the usual three peak weeks seen in Q1 - Q3.

        "title": "Nvidia's rivals are circling, but they're still years from catching up",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is the AI king. Its share of the global AI chip market is estimated at anywhere between 70% and 90%. Its high-powered graphics processors, which are perfect for training AI models and putting them to work, are in such demand that getting them is a task all its own.\n\nIn June, with the AI craze in full swing, Nvidia’s market cap eclipsed the $1 trillion mark. And on Friday, shares of the company hit an all-time high of $549.91.\n\nIt’s not just Nvidia’s hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The company’s Cuda software, which developers use to create AI platforms, is just as important to Nvidia’s staying power.\n\n“Software continues to be Nvidia's strategic moat,” explained Gartner VP analyst Chirag Dekate. “These ... turnkey experiences enable Nvidia to be at the forefront of mindshare, as well as adoption.”\n\nNvidia’s lead didn’t happen overnight. It’s been working on AI products for years, even as investors questioned the move.\n\n“Nvidia, to its credit, started about 15 years ago working with universities to find novel things that you could do with GPUs, aside from gaming and visualization,” explained Moor Insights & Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead.\n\n“What Nvidia does is they help create markets and that puts competitors in a very tough situation out there, because by the time they've caught up, Nvidia is on to the next new thing,” he added. Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the Hon Hai Tech Day in Taipei on Oct. 18, 2023. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nBut threats to Nvidia’s reign are rising. Rivals Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) are marshaling their forces to grab their own slice of the AI pie. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s own data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nIt’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Meta (META), are increasingly turning to their own chips in the form of what are known as ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits.\n\nStory continues\n\nThink of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it.\n\nASICs, on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. They’re built specifically for a company’s own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\n\nThat’s a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as hyperscalers focus more on their own ASICs, they may have less of a need for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThat said, on the whole Nvidia’s technology is well ahead of its competitors.\n\n“They have a ... long-term research pipeline to continue driving the future of GPU leadership,” Dekate explained. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind when it comes to AI chips is how they’re used. The first way is training models, which is called, well, training. The second is putting those models into practice so that people can use them to do things like generate a specific output you want, whether that’s in the form of a text, images, or something else entirely. That’s called inferencing.\n\nOpenAI has inferences of ChatGPT, while Microsoft has inferences of Copilot. And every time you send a request to either program, they take advantage of AI accelerators to generate the text or image you want.\n\nOver time, inferencing is likely to become the primary use case for AI chips as more companies seek to take advantage of different AI models.\n\nStill, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. So even if Nvidia’s market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says founder Jeff Bezos is the ‘most unusual business leader of our era’",
        "content": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is not interested in comparing himself to his cowboy hat-wearing, work-life-balance-scrutinizing predecessor.\n\nJassy told Fortune CEO Alan Murray at a dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday that his predecessor, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, was one of a kind.\n\n“I learned from somebody who's arguably the most unusual business leader of our era,” he said.\n\nJassy added that he was “lucky” to work closely with Bezos for 20 of his 26.5 years at Amazon, but played coy in saying what exactly made him different from Bezos. He argued that the challenges he is facing at the helm of Amazon differ from what Bezos experienced.\n\n“I do think that every era of business leadership … is different,” he said. “When I started the job, nobody really predicted that the pandemic would last that long, and Omicron would come, and the war in Ukraine would come and the inflation—there's lots of things that happen throughout, and you have to just keep adjusting, and that's what we tried to do as a team.”\n\nThough Jassy worked to separate his predecessor’s hardships from his own, he has inherited many issues from Bezos, including streaming losses and slowing sales growth and delivery operations.\n\nJassy took over as CEO after Bezos stepped down in July 2021 to focus on philanthropy and growing his rocket company, Blue Origin. Jassy joined Amazon in 1997 as a marketing manager and launched the cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Bezos in 2006. AWS helped generate $13 billion of Amazon’s $21 billion 2020 revenue, which, along with Jassy’s insider status and long tenure, made him a clear candidate for CEO.\n\nBezos’ departure was part of a decade-long trend of iconic, often founding CEOs in Big Tech stepping down or being replaced. Tim Cook took Apple’s reins from Steve Jobs in 2011, Satya Nadella took over Microsoft from Steve Ballmer in 2014, and Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. in December 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Bezos was known to be competitive and intense, Jassy is known for being diplomatic and friendly. Becoming CEO of the world’s largest e-commerce company wasn’t part of his original professional plan.\n\n“I was surprised,” Jassy told Vanity Fair. “I wasn’t anticipating it, I wasn’t clamoring for it, I loved my current job, but I was obviously flattered and excited by the prospect.”\n\nJassy’s humility hasn’t kept him from putting his foot down when necessary, including cracking down increasingly on Amazon's return-to-office mandates. In August, the CEO told remote workers that “it’s probably not going to work out for [them]” if they refused to comply with his three-day hybrid work plan. Jassy has a meeting room called the “Chop,” where he’s known for striking down employees’ big ideas, Business Insider reported.\n\nHis rising up the ranks and unsentimental attitude toward Amazon is reflected in his approach to growing the company, where he’s largely tried to keep it on the path his predecessor built while pruning back on some of Amazon’s overbuilt investments. In September 2022, Amazon canceled or closed 44 warehouses and delayed 25 more. Earlier this month, the company laid off hundreds of movie and streaming division employees across Amazon MGM Studios, Prime Video, and Twitch. It cut 27,000 jobs across the company in 2023, including several hundred in the Alexa division.\n\nJassy’s mission to steady the company has been successful. Third-quarter revenue in 2023 was up 13% at $143.1 billion compared to the year before. Amazon’s stock is up 85% over the past five years and up 20% in the last six months with a 1.60 trillion market capitalization.\n\nJassy told Fortune on Thursday that Amazon plans to focus on growing subscription-based health care provider One Medical and Prime streaming services, as well as Project Kuiper to grow broadband connections, particularly in rural communities.\n\n“It’s a big capital investment, but I think it will help a lot of people and will be a good business as well,” Jassy said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "The Magnificent Seven stocks are the new FAANG. Unsurprisingly, many members of the FAANG cohort are a part of the Magnificent Seven. The large tech companies that comprise this group have consistently paced and outperformed the market. Investors would have been very happy to start positions in any of the Magnificent Seven stocks ten years ago.\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks offer a vision of possibilities for long-term investors, new stocks are emerging. Some equities have outperformed the Magnificent Seven stocks without much fanfare. But, that can change within a few years.\n\nTherefore, investors looking for high-potential stocks may want to consider these three growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCloudflare (NET) The logo of Cloudflare, (NET) an US web infrastructure & security company, its website on iOS.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) and the other stocks on this list have 1-year and 5-year returns that would make most of the Magnificent Seven stocks jealous. Additionally, NET offers content delivery network services and keeps websites safe from cyberattacks.\n\nSwitching out of any content delivery network or cybersecurity service takes considerable time. Furthermore, if the results are good, business owners will just stick with the platform. Cloudflare has done a great job at retaining customers and attracting new ones. That dynamic helped the company achieve 32% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth and narrow its net losses.\n\nThe stock has gained 83% over the past year and is up by 333% over the past five years. A switch to profitability and continued revenue growth can send the stock much higher in the long run. It’s normal for high-potential companies to not be profitable right away. It took Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) almost a decade to become profitable.\n\nCloudflare has accelerated its efforts into artificial intelligence and has entered into several partnerships. AI can fuel more revenue growth for the company and help its stock outperform the Magnificent Seven.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a cloud networking company with a long history of beating the market. Further, shares have gained 131% over the past year and are up by 353% over the past five years. The firm has a 34-forward P/E ratio.\n\nCorporations use Arista Networks to keep their sensitive data safe and become more efficient. ANET has over 8,000 cloud customers worldwide including large corporations like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThese companies should stick around for many years since their products need solutions from companies like Arista Networks to function smoothly. Investment management firm Giverny Capital mentioned that the computing power for an AI chat query is “roughly seven times more than for a Google or Bing search.”\n\nArista Networks has continued to delight investors with its earnings reports. The company reported 28.3% YOY revenue growth in the third quarter. Net income went up by 54.1% YOY. Those growth rates and the tremendous AI runway can help Arista Networks reward long-term investors.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is riding the wave of a 74% 1-year gain and a 290% increase over the past five years. In fact, investors are excited about the stock and have bid it up to a $153 billion market cap.\n\nServiceNow offers cloud computing technology that helps organizations run more efficiently and manage data. The company has over 7,700 customers. Additionally, 49 of those customers have annual contract values above $20 million. Also, NOW has nearly 1,800 customers with annual contract values exceeding $1 million.\n\nMost of the company’s customers remain, which means high revenue and earnings growth. ServiceNow reported 25% YOY revenue growth in the third quarter and more than tripled its net income during the same period.\n\nFinally, net profit margins have been expanding nicely and reached double-digits in Q3. Thus, ServiceNow has outperformed most of the Magnificent Seven stocks and looks poised to continue that trend in 2024 and beyond.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NET, ANET, and NOW.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the current stock market investment trends, and go directly to read 5 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nOn Friday, January 19, the S&P 500 achieved a historic milestone by closing at an all-time high, as investors enthusiastically reentered the equity market after a brief stumble at the beginning of 2024. The broad market index recorded a 1.23% increase, settling at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior intraday and closing highs set in January 2022. Simultaneously, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had established its own record at the close of the previous year, surged by 395.19 points or 1.05%, concluding at 37,863.80. The Nasdaq Composite saw a 1.70% uptick, reaching 15,310.97, while the more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.95%, also attaining a new record high. Notably, all three major averages are now in positive territory for the year 2024, with the 30-stock Dow turning green during Friday's robust rally.\n\nIn addition, traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve will delay easing its policy until May, marking the conclusion of a week characterized by robust economic data and statements from central bankers that eroded confidence in the possibility of earlier interest-rate cuts. On January 19, a key gauge of consumer sentiment reached its highest level in 2-1/2 years, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee stated that the U.S. central bank would refrain from committing to rate cuts until there is greater certainty regarding inflation aligning with a healthy 2%. Futures contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate declined, indicating approximately a 47% chance of a rate cut by March, down from 55% earlier in the day. Just a week ago, the likelihood of an interest-rate cut in March stood at nearly 80%, reflecting a swifter-than-anticipated decline in inflation.\n\nIn such an economic environment, it makes sense for investors to turn to stocks that are both lucrative and affordable to navigate such macroeconomic conditions. While these stocks may not always offer the same level of security as mega-cap firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), they present an opportunity for decent short-term returns due to their volatility. Some of the best affordable stocks in this context include Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), among others listed below.\n\nStory continues 15 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA close-up of an investor pointing to a chart featured on a projector, conveying a message of growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best affordable stocks to buy, we used stock screeners to shortlist stocks that were trading at a share price of less than $50.

Based on 2026 Ebitda projections of $33.30 billion, it trades at a 2.5 times multiple.\n\nOn a price-earnings basis, the company trades at 7.3 times the 2025 consensus of $9.61 and 6.6 times the 2026 consensus of $10.65.\n\nRevenue is projected to grow over 8.5% in 2025 and 5.8% in 2026 after growing 9.5% this fiscal year ending in March. Excluding its $73 billion in net cash, it trades 4.30 times 2025 earnings per share and 3.80 times 2026 estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba trades at a big discount to its U.S. counterpart Amazon, as well as fast-growing rival PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). It trades at a slight premium to fellow Chinese e-commerce company JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).\n\nNotably, Alibaba now trades at a price lower than its initial public offering price in 2014, despite growing revenue tenfold and earnings fivefold during that time.\n\nOpportunities and risks\n\nAlibaba is being valued as a distressed company in trouble, not a leading bellwether in the world's second-largest economy. It is anything but a distressed company, though, with $73 billion in net cash and short-term investments in its coffers. It is also still growing with revenue up 13.9% in its fiscal first quarter ended June and growing 8.5% in its fiscal second quarter ended September.\n\nNow gross margins have come down considerably from pre-pandemic levels, when they were in the mid to upper 40% range. However, they have stabilized and were up 180 basis year over year in the first half to 38.60%.\n\nAdjusted Ebitda, meanwhile, has been growing strongly, increasing 32% in its June quarter and 18% in its September quarter.\n\nWith a boatload of cash, solid cash flow generation and an extremely cheap stock price by any measure, buying back stock is one opportunity for Alibaba. The company repurchased $9.5 billion worth of shares in 2023, but it can certainly get more aggressive as it only reduced its share count by about 3%.\n\nNow part of the reason behind Alibaba's weak stock performance, as well as that of rival JD.com, has been the emergence of PDD. The company's Pinduoduo platform, which lets group buyers get discounts on everyday goods, has seen huge growth over the past year and a half. To try and counter the success of its rival, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall platforms, as well as JD.com, introduced large subsides to third-party merchants during popular Chinese shopping holidays to draw them to the platform. It has since moved to an everyday low price strategy. The end result so far has been a pricing war that has seen PDD still emerge as the winner, with growth greatly outpacing Alibaba and JD.com.\n\nAlibaba has seen other setbacks as well. It scrapped plans to IPO its cloud computing unit after the U.S. banned the export of certain high-powered GPU chips to China. It has also had to pour money into its Southeast Asian e-commerce unit Lazada to fend off competition from the likes of TikTok and Shopee.\n\nWhen it comes to opportunities, an improving Chinese economy could go a long way in helping the Chinese e-commerce giant out. The Chinese economy was expected to get a boost coming out of Covid lockdown restrictions that were lifted in 2023. However, the economic recovery has been slower than expected. The economy picked up to around 5.20% growth in 2023, up from 3% in 2022, but it was still some of the slowest growth the country has seen in three decades. Growth, meanwhile, is expected to slow to 4.50% this year.\n\nAs a result, the Chinese stock market as a whole preformed pretty poorly in 2023, with the CSI 300 index down about 11% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng off 14%. Meanwhile, the rest of the world was seeing stocks soar, with the MSCI World index climbing 22%, showing the huge divergence in performance between China and other stock markets. That has left the Chinese market as a whole relatively cheap, and companies like Alibaba particularly inexpensive.\n\nAnother opportunity the company will look to take advantage of is artificial intelligence. While a chip ban will impact it some, the company is committed to bringing AI innovation to its Taobao and Tmall platforms, as well as to its cloud business.\n\nDuring its third-quarter earning call, CEO Yongming Wu said:\n\nRegarding driving growth with AI, we see a fundamental paradigm shift underway in computing worldwide. We stand at the inflection point in this shift from traditional computing to AI computing. In the future, incremental demand for cloud computing will be driven by demand for AI and most AI computing will run on the cloud. Going forward, we will do 2 things. First, we will build the most open cloud in the AI era, providing stable and efficient AI infrastructure for all industries and enabling all sectors to go intelligent. Second, we will build an open and prosperous AI ecosystem. At the recently concluded Apsara Conference, we announced a comprehensive upgrade of our AI infrastructure, the artificial intelligence platform PAI and our large model Tongyi Qianwen 2.0, which has hundreds of billions of parameters as well as 8 vertical models, also a one-stop model application development platform, Alibaba Cloud Bailian. In this AI era, we now have in place a full stack cloud computing system for AI development and are ready to better support demand for AI-driven computing power.\n\nDespite restrictions on some high-power chips, I do not expect Alibaba and other Chinese tech companies will be left out in the cold when it comes to AI. Given its heft, the company still is in a strong position to be a leader in using AI to help improve its businesses.\n\nIf the Chinese economy does not recover and continue to slow, however, that is certainly a risk. Another risk would be if the government were to break the company up due to its size, or if China were to pull back from the rest of the world due to geopolitical factors.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlibaba is one of the cheapest large-scale tech-oriented and e-commerce companies in the world. Its valuation has gotten to unprecenteded levels, and while the company is not firing on all cylinders and is dealing with intense competition, it is still nicely growing its business and has a stock pile of cash.\n\nNo doubt it will take time to turn around the size of a company with so many units like Alibaba. However, for a stock trading at well under 3 times Ebitda with a fortress of a balance sheet and solid growth, it is hard to imagine the stock not being a winner in five years, barring a black swan type of event.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) share price is up 90% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 73% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 59%.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nOver half a decade, Amazon.com managed to grow its earnings per share at 16% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 14% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 59% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. Before spending more time on Amazon.com it might be wise to click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Broadwind’s heavy fabrication unit makes some of the world’s biggest fabricated steel structures, equipment and components. Its Brad Foote Gearing unit makes large-scale industrial gears and gearboxes. And its industrial solutions unit is involved int installing power generation units for oil, gas and solar energy production.\n\nBroadwind reported Q3 revenue of $57.2 million, up $12.3 million from a year ago. Broadwind also had a profit of $4.4 million in GAAP net income or 20 cents per share. That’s an improvement from a net loss of $1.8 million and -9 cents per share in the previous year.\n\nBWEN stock is up 20% since that earnings report came out in mid-November. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nD-Wave Quantum (QBTS) A digital rendering of a circuit board and digital chip in neon colors to illustrate quantum computing\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nD-Wave Quantum (NASDAQ:QBTS) is another quantum computing company with dual headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and Vancouver.\n\nD-Wave provides a full-stack, cross-platform quantum computing solution built for businesses that are developing their quantum computing platforms. It includes Leap, the company’s cloud service, and professional services to help transition clients into the quantum space.\n\nIt works with customers who are attempting to develop quantum computing solutions that can solve logistics problems, manage supply chains or perform complex scheduling tasks.\n\nD-Wave recorded $2.6 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 51% from the previous year. It’s expecting full-year revenue to come in between $10 million and $11.5 million, and for full-year losses to be less than $56 million.\n\nD-Wave is losing money for now, but it’s scaling rapidly and has a bright future. But beware – D-Wave is still a small company with a market capitalization of less than $115 million, so the stock price will be volatile. Still, it gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nC4 Therapeutics (CCCC) Image of two scientists in lab coats studying results in a lab. best biotech stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nC4 Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CCCC) is a biotech company that’s working to develop new treatments for cancer and other diseases by using the body’s natural protein recycling system to attach disease-causing proteins.\n\nC4 recently closed a $25 million investment from Betta Pharmaceuticals in China, giving it additional resources to fund research and development of therapies. And in December, it signed a license and research collaboration with Merck (NYSE:MRK) that supplied $10 million now and the potential for up to $600 million down the road, plus tiered royalties for products that C4 develops with Merck.\n\n“Building on recent momentum, we are well positioned to make meaningful advances across our portfolio in 2024,” CEO Andrew Hirsch said.\n\nRevenue in the third quarter was $11.1 million, up from $6.8 million a year ago.

I encourage you to catch up on coverage here.\n\nIt's a truly unique annual event, one where you could be eating a giant Swiss-made hot dog on the street while Bill Gates walks by minus security (you can watch our full chat with Mr. Gates from WEF 2024, absent hot dog eating).\n\nThe theme of the conference was none other than AI, from what's next tech-wise to the downside risks of the large language models (LLMs) now permeating the world's infrastructure.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me on Yahoo Finance Live he sees a world of \"digital people\" taking shape.\n\nYeah, it got that deep in my chat with Marc.\n\nBottom line, I (and I won't speak for Julie here!) barely knew what most of the AI super experts were talking about. This stuff is just next level — one has to be entrenched in generative AI to truly get it, I think. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nWhat my simpleton self does know is this: 2024 will be the year of AI embedding itself into the very fabric of workplaces and the internet. In turn, this will be the year where many companies in the AI space swing from 2023 losses to profits.\n\nIt will be the year where big and powerful players such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) will get more powerful and profitable due to AI advances. These companies are attracting the best AI talent because they can afford to do so. This will widen their lead in the race to introduce game-changing AI products and services.\n\nHaving said all of this, maybe you understand AI better than me. I can appreciate that.\n\nHere are some of the sights and sounds on the AI front from WEF 2024, as Yahoo Finance Live was told.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorkday co-CEO Carl Eschenbach\n\n\"I think you'll start to see co-pilots. We'll have generative AI co-pilots that will help you navigate through things. I think it will start to push recommendations around where you need to be skilled or re-skilled and recommend to you what's next in your journey to advance your career. We can start to look at recruiting as a way to leverage AI. And then we have this thing called a career insight hub that will help both managers and employees navigate their careers and give those recommendations on where you should go and get new skills to advance your career. And it will help them with internal mobility of your people.\"\n\nHP CEO Enrique Lores\n\n\"The AI PC is coming this year. And it's going be probably one of the biggest changes in the PC industry since the PC was invented more than 20 years ago. It'll allow customers to run AI applications locally. So what today you need to do in the cloud with a large language model, you will be able to do that in the PC. And from a cost, security, and speed perspective, it brings a lot of advantages.\"\n\nQualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon\n\n\"One big conversation right now is how we can help industries and what are the different use cases. And there's an incredible amount of interest in getting [AI] on the device. Just think about automotive as an example. Natural language communication is perfect when you are behind the wheel, and the car is now a new computing space. So how can we add those capabilities to some of the models, some that are in development with the existing hardware that we have.\"\n\nTech investor & Black Eyed Peas star will.i.am\n\n\"One project that I just launched with Mercedes is called Sound Drive that utilizes AI and transforms how we listen to music while we commute.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 22, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Hibbett, Inc. HIBB, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Target Corp. TGT and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nCan Resilient Consumer Spending Continue into 2024? 4 Picks to Consider\n\nAgainst the backdrop of inflation and high-interest rate concerns, U.S. consumers showcased remarkable resilience during the 2023 holiday season. Data released by the National Retail Federation (“NRF”) reveals a noteworthy 3.8% surge in sales, reaching a record-breaking $964.4 billion. This impressive performance aligns seamlessly with the NRF’s forecast, indicating a rise between 3% and 4%.\n\nDespite tighter budgets, Americans embraced the festive season, capitalizing on substantial discounts available across various retail categories. NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz emphasized the enduring strength of consumer spending throughout 2023, concluding the year on a high note during the holiday season. The ease in goods prices, coupled with a healthy labor market, underscored the success of the season for retailers.\n\nThe 2023 holiday sales results surpassed the previous record set in 2022 by an impressive $34.9 billion. The holiday season, spanning from Nov 1 through Dec 31, saw a stellar 8.2% increase in online and non-store sales, amounting to $276.8 billion. This indicates a shift in consumer preferences toward digital channels.\n\nDiving into the data, impressive year-over-year gains in various retail categories during the November-December holiday sales period reveal the diverse spending patterns of consumers. Electronics and appliance stores led the pack with a remarkable 9.3% increase, followed closely by health and personal care stores at 9%. Clothing and clothing accessory stores also experienced a noteworthy 3% jump.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral merchandise stores showcased resilience with a 2% year-over-year increase, while grocery and beverage stores experienced modest 1.1% growth. Sporting goods stores saw a 0.3% uptick. However, building materials and garden supply stores faced a decline of 3.9%, while furniture and home furnishings stores encountered a downturn of 6.2%.\n\nThe resilience displayed by Americans in their spending spree defies speculations about a potential economic slowdown in the new year. That said, we have highlighted four stocks from the sector that look well-poised to capitalize on the resilient consumer environment.\n\n4 Prominent Picks\n\nHibbett, Inc. is a potential pick. Hibbett boasts distinct competitive advantages, including superior customer service, a best-in-class omnichannel shopping experience, strong vendor relationships, strategic in-store placement and a presence in underserved markets. These advantages contribute to the company's ability to maintain and grow its market share. The company’s focus on improved expense management and disciplined inventory controls demonstrates a commitment to operational efficiency.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hibbett’s current fiscal sales suggests growth of 1.7% from the year-ago reported figure. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 24.2%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is worth considering. The company’s robust e-commerce platform, renowned for its vast product selection and efficient delivery services, continues to be a primary driver of revenue growth. Prime membership, a cornerstone of Amazon's success, not only fosters customer loyalty but also drives recurring revenues through subscription fees, offering members exclusive access to a myriad of services, such as expedited shipping.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon’s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 11.1% and 278.9%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. AMZN, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 54.9%, on average.\n\nInvestors can count on Target Corp. This Minneapolis, MN-based company has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the dynamic retail landscape. Target has been deploying resources to enhance omnichannel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. These have been contributing to the top line.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Target’s current financial-year EPS suggests growth of 38.5% from the year-ago reported figure. TGT, which carries a Zacks Rank #2, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 30.8%, on average.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters, Inc. is worth betting on. The company’s efforts to rationalize inventory and contain costs are paying off. The strong performance of key brands like American Eagle and Aerie, coupled with expansions into premium and activewear segments, indicates potential for growth. Its store designs and online enhancements demonstrate a commitment to improving the customer experience.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Eagle Outfitters’ current fiscal sales and EPS suggests growth of 5% and 43.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. AEO, which carries a Zacks Rank #2, delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 23%, on average.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks to Buy Before They Soar in 2024",
        "content": "There's no surefire way to know which stocks will generate excellent long-term returns for their shareholders. Any such forecast is even cloudier when you're looking at smaller time frames like a year or two.\n\nYet, an investor can still maximize their chances of picking long-term winners. Putting several high-performing growth stocks in your portfolio will help, especially if the companies are showing impressive operating momentum in expanding markets. Two great examples today are Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP). Let's look at a few compelling reasons to buy these tech stocks today.\n\nAmazon has options\n\nAmazon will issue its first official 2024 outlook as part of its fourth-quarter earnings release in early February. But investors don't have to wait until then to buy this stellar growth stock.\n\nAmazon is capitalizing on several huge growth avenues right now that all combined to add $16 billion to its Q3 sales footprint. Those gains came through higher demand in the e-commerce business, which has now emerged from its post-pandemic growth hangover.\n\nThe even better news came from Amazon's cloud services division. That unit, anchored by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, is growing faster than the digital storefront. It's much more profitable and delivers extra stability thanks to its high proportion of software-as-a-service (SaaS) sales .\n\nAmazon executives are allowing that growth to flow into higher profitability, too. Operating income soared to $11 billion last quarter from $2.5 billion a year earlier. Cash flow is up over 80% in the past year, too, indicating more earnings growth ahead.\n\nInvestors have to balance those gains against a stock price that's become more expensive in recent months. Still, Amazon has a good shot at extending its positive momentum as its business tilts more toward services sales in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShopify is adding value\n\nThere are a lot of things going right for Shopify's business right now, but the biggest reason for investors to feel optimistic about this stock is its success at delivering more value to merchants. That rising value shows up most clearly in sales volumes, which were up a blazing 22% in the most recent quarter. \"We're extremely pleased with our financial performance this quarter,\" said CFO Jeff Hoffmeister, in an early November press release .\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth trends appear to have only improved since then thanks to a successful holiday shopping season on the platform. Shopify's Black Friday sales volumes were up 24%, year over year, the company reported in late November.\n\nShopify's profit margins are still looking weak, and growth investors will want to watch that metric over the next few quarters for signs that the company can generate sustainably strong earnings. The good news is, all signs are pointing in that direction. Free cash flow has been positive in each of the last four quarters and has climbed to 16% of total revenue.\n\nThe stock rallied sharply in 2023 thanks to this good news around sales and earnings trends. Some further positive gains here could power positive returns for shareholders. Consider that eBay converts over 30% of its sales into cash flow. If Shopify can keep making progress in this direction, which seems likely, then investors have every reason to expect continued good returns from holding this growth stock in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Shopify wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 8, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Turn $1,000 Into $2,000 by 2029",
        "content": "Growing your wealth over time can be easy work. Set up an investment portfolio that can deliver a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 15%. Let it run for five years if you're looking to double your money. So, if you put $1,000 into that investment, you'd have $2,000 by the end of 2029.\n\nNow, where can you find stocks promising to provide an average return of 15% per year for the next five years? First, you may not need a stock at all if an index-tracking exchange-traded fund (ETF) can get the job done.\n\nAn index fund tracking the venerable S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) probably wouldn't quite do it, for example. The CAGR for this market tracker worked out to 12.6% over the last five years and -- for investors who prefer basing their decisions on more reliable long-term statistics -- 8.1% in the last three decades. Sure beats the average interest rate on savings accounts, but it won't double your money in five years.\n\nThere are other index funds that seem likely to meet these goals, though. Switching to the more volatile bet on mostly tech stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index, the average return in five years lands at 20.6%. That's more than enough for my stated purposes. It's not a surefire guarantee, of course -- the truly long-term Nasdaq 100 return stops at 8.9% from a 30-year perspective. That's volatility from the dot-com bubble rearing its unexpected head three decades later.\n\nStill, a Nasdaq 100 tracker, such as the  Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), may deliver the desired return if the artificial intelligence (AI) boost of 2023 sticks around for a few more years. But this is one of those instances where hand-picked stocks might provide the returns that a more stable index fund probably can't. On that note, let me show you a couple of top-notch stocks that should see average five-year returns of 15% or more.\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) offer that rare combination of thrilling growth prospects and the proven flexibility to stay on that growth track for years and maybe even decades ahead. And they're not even expensive right now despite having gained more than 60% each in the last 52 weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nA proven winner with a flexible future\n\nAlphabet stands as a bastion of innovation in an ever-evolving digital landscape -- often leading from the front. The Google parent continues to push boundaries, especially in the realm of AI.\n\nEven its namesake search service can be seen as a form of AI, and the company keeps adding more digital smarts to its main business, with tools like natural language processing and sophisticated results-ranking algorithms based on deep learning analytics. Products such as Google Translate and the Google Maps navigation feature take the AI connection one step further, explicitly building the consumer experience around neural networks and machine learning systems.\n\nThe company's sustained revenue growth and strategic investments signal a future as dynamic as its past. The Alphabet umbrella structure lets the company try new and entirely different business ideas without confusing consumers expecting the Google brand to focus on online services. That's a stroke of flexible genius from 2015, among the first acts of CFO and financial heavyweight Ruth Porat, formerly the CFO of financial services giant Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is well within reason at 6.2 times trailing revenues, far below fellow AI experts such as Nvidia or Microsoft. All in all, Alphabet offers a compelling case for investors looking for a blend of stability and forward-thinking growth. Shareholders have enjoyed a CAGR of 21.4% for five years and 23.3% since the initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. That's a paragon of high-growth stability rarely seen in the tech sector or anywhere else.\n\nPast returns are no guarantee of future results, but Alphabet's history inspires plenty of confidence in the stock's future prospects. If you want to double your money in five years, this stock seems likely to deliver the goods.\n\nThe innovative powerhouse Jeff Bezos built\n\nAmazon's journey from an online bookstore to a diversified e-commerce and cloud computing behemoth shows its capacity to defy market boundaries.\n\nThe Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform didn't exactly invent cloud computing, but it was one of the first widely available cloud systems on a global scale. Started as an experimental way to squeeze some business value out of unused capacity in Amazon's e-commerce data centers, AWS has grown into the company's most profitable and fastest-growing arm. Its robust selection of AI tools should accelerate that trend in the years ahead.\n\nThe company's strategic investments in new technologies and markets, from healthcare to entertainment, reveal a bottomless appetite for growth. Founder Jeff Bezos famously expects Amazon to operate as if every day is \"day one\" for a brand-new upstart with limitless growth potential. Current CEO Andy Jassy has embraced the same philosophy, and it shows in Amazon's appetite for seemingly risky growth-boosting bets.\n\nFrom overnight and same-day shipping to cloud-based AI tools and the innovative Amazon Market platform for independent retailers, Amazon has a long history of investing billions of dollars in promising growth boosters. Not every swing is a home run, as proven by disappointments such as the forgettable Fire Phone and Amazon Auctions projects. However, the big wins more than make up for a few misses along the way.\n\nIf Amazon keeps up this growth-oriented attitude and impressive hit ratio for another five years, I don't see why the annual stock returns would fall below 15%. There may not be any guarantees in the stock market, but an Amazon investment at 2.9 times sales comes close. Like Alphabet, Amazon looks poised to double your money in five short years.\n\nThere you have it -- two stocks and one ETF that should double your money by 2029. Any combination of Amazon, Alphabet, and the Invesco QQQ Trust should help you achieve that goal and build your wealth well beyond that modest target.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

In the quarter the fund returned 14.43% (net) compared to 14.16% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 11.69% for the S&P 500 Index. For the full year, the fund returned 38.99% (net) compared to 42.68% and 26.29% returns for the indexes.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $155.34 per share. One-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 1.25%, and its shares gained 59.73% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a market capitalization of $1.605 trillion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Sunrise King on Unsplash\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "10 Top Rated Blue Chip Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are In Love With: January 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten top rated blue chip stocks Wall Street analysts are in love with in January 2024. If you want to skip our latest stock market coverage and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then you can read 5 Top Rated Blue Chip Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are In Love With: January 2024.\n\nWith 2024 officially in full flow, the stock markets are performing well. The NASDAQ 100 index is trading at all-time high level, and the S&P 500 joined it on January 19th when it touched 4,804 and crossed its previous all-time high reading of 4,796 recorded two years ago.\n\nThe market as a whole appears to be entering 2024 with cautious optimism. Throughout 2023, investors battled with the Federal Reserve and economic data to time their bets and decipher Mr. Market's moves. Now, investors are trying to figure out whether the Federal Reserve's optimism through its interest rate hiking cycle in 2023 will prove warranted. The economy is performing well, in an interesting conundrum. While economic growth is always welcomed by the market, this time around, it accompanies concerns that perhaps a robust economy will also mean that the Fed feels comfortable keeping interest rates higher for longer.\n\nThroughout the interest rate hiking cycle, and especially last year, the Fed has maintained that a soft landing for the U.S. economy might be on the horizon. What this means is that while interest rate increases will slow down growth, there won't be a recession.  Should this be the case, then the pain for consumers in the form of job losses can be mitigated.\n\nYet, even if the economy doesn't tip into recession, the system is already under stress from high interest rates. The start of the year has marked earnings reports from banks, and the consensus on that front is that while interest income is at all time high levels, bank deposit costs are also growing much faster than belt tightening managers would like. Some of the offending banks on this list are M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY). Discovery, known for its digital banking services that provide branch less banking and loans, saw its net income plummet to $388 million during the fourth quarter from a sizeable year ago figure of $1 billion. At the core of this massive drop was an uncertain lending environment due to high rates. This forced Discovery to allocate more funds to risky loans in its portfolio, which ended up affecting the income statement. M&T and KeyCorp bother suffered from higher deposit costs. These led M&T to report a 6% drop in its net interest income, with KeyCorp's NII plummeting by a sizeable 24%.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting from banks, technology stocks are off to a good start this year. One of the most widely talked about technology industries in the world is the semiconductor industry, and January saw a lot of optimism from the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). TSMC reported its fourth quarter of 2023 earnings, and at the accompanying analyst call, the firm's management expressed confidence that it could capture the market for A.I. chips.\n\nTSMC's CEO Dr. C.C. Wei shared at the firm's fourth quarter of 2023 earnings call:\n\nNo matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models as the amount of computation required for training and inference is increasing.\n\nAs a result, AI models need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing, and we are all well positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI. To address insatiable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading edge process technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering.\n\nTSMC's optimism about A.I. coupled with Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) raising its second quarter of fiscal 2024 guidance by a cool $700 million is proving beneficial to technology stocks and the semiconductor sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up by a healthy 5.8% over the past five days, mirroring the performance of broader stock indexes.\n\nAmidst this cautiously optimistic environment that's seeing investors eager to not miss out on potential future trends, we thought to take a look at some top rated blue chip stocks that Wall Street analysts are in love with.

        "title": "Here's the Only Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood Both Own As 2024 Begins",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood are like two peas in a pod. At least, that's the case if the pod spanned millions of miles and the two famous investors were on polar ends of it.\n\nThe reality is that Buffett and Wood don't see eye-to-eye on many stocks. However, there's one notable exception. Here's the only artificial intelligence (AI) stock that both Buffett and Wood own as 2024 begins.\n\nSmall positions for both famous investors\n\nWood's Ark Invest portfolio is chock-full of AI stocks. That's not surprising, considering that Wood has been a vocal proponent of AI for years. It's a different story with Buffett. The legendary investor is well-known for focusing only on stocks that are in his circle of competence. AI definitely doesn't fit the bill.\n\nBut there is one -- and only one -- AI stock that both investors own. Admittedly, though, their stakes in this stock are fairly small.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) makes up 0.4% of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. While Berkshire initiated a position in Amazon in 2019, Buffett acknowledged at the time that the decision was made by one of the conglomerate's two investment managers. Still, he likes the company and the stock, telling CNBC, \"Yeah, I've been a fan, and I've been an idiot for not buying.\"\n\nWood's position in Amazon is even smaller. And the stock isn't in any of her exchanged-traded funds (ETFs) that focus heavily on AI. Instead, Amazon is included in the Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF. The company's Project Kuiper satellite broadband network apparently caught Wood's attention.\n\nAmazon's AI story\n\nAmazon isn't a johnny-come-lately to the world of AI. The company has developed and used AI for more than two decades.\n\nAI permeates the algorithms used on Amazon's e-commerce platform. Every time a user sees a recommendation for a product to buy, it's an example of the company's AI at work. The e-commerce giant recently upped its game on this front, launching a generative AI tool to answer shoppers' questions about products.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon introduced its Alexa virtual assistant way back in 2014. Alexa is embedded in the company's Echo, Firestick, and Kindle Fire devices.\n\nThe bigger AI opportunity for Amazon, though, is with its cloud services platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). CEO Andy Jassy underscored why AWS could be such a big winner in AI in his comments during the company's third-quarter earnings call. He stated, \"[C]ustomers want to bring the [AI] models to their data, not the other way around. And much of the data resides in AWS as the clear market segment leader in cloud infrastructure.\"\n\nIs Amazon a smart pick for less well-known investors?\n\nBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its position a little in Amazon in the third quarter of 2023. Wood's Ark Invest released a report several months ago that downplayed mega-cap AI stocks such as Amazon in favor of smaller up-and-comers. However, I think that there are several reasons to buy Amazon stock right now.\n\nThe company's bottom line continues to improve significantly. Amazon's management has focused intently on boosting profits by streamlining operations across the board. Those efforts are bearing fruit, as evidenced by earnings more than tripling year over year in 2023 Q3.\n\nJassy has said in the past that roughly 90% to 95% of global IT spending is still on-premises with the rest in the cloud. He believes those numbers will flip over the next 10 to 15 years. I suspect he's right. If so, AWS should have massive growth prospects ahead.\n\nLast, but not least, Amazon hasn't stopped looking for ways to expand into new markets. Just last year, the company launched a supply chain management service, introduced a primary care service for Prime members, and announced that it will sell cars online. I expect more expansions in the future.\n\nMy view is that Buffett and Wood would be wise to add to their stakes in Amazon. And I think the AI stock is a smart pick for less well-known investors, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Investors to Follow on Twitter and Social Media.\n\nMorgan Stanley Bullish on Diversified, Alpha Hedge Fund Portfolios\n\nOn December 31, 2023, Morgan Stanley reported that falling inflation levels are expected to be sluggishly above bank targets ahead of 2024. Such may lead to price dispersion and provide hedge fund alpha opportunities across asset classes. Throughout 2024, the Fed is expected to ease monetary policy which may eventually push wide discrepancies among winners and losers. While an easing cycle coupled with higher interest rates may increase volatility in bond prices, hedge funds may be able to benefit from higher interest rates, especially with derivative-based investing strategies. Morgan Stanley is bullish on diversified and alpha hedge fund portfolios in the current environment. The market is uncertain and the outlook for 2024 seems unclear, which may be a hint towards avoiding big and risky bets.\n\nTop Stock Picks of Hedge Funds\n\nInstitutional investors are heavily positioned in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc.

To commence with our research we first established certain parameters to define a niche for our list. Therefore, our list consists of popular hedge fund managers that primarily own a Twitter account, and other social media channels if available. We first consulted four reports on the internet including Forbes, Benzinga, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance. We then applied certain filters on LinkedIn using keywords such as \"hedge fund manager\" to ensure we did not miss any important names. Finally, we also looked up founding members and owners of popular hedge funds. This thorough process enabled us to come up with 55 hedge fund managers. We then conducted a manual search to find the Twitter account of every investor along with other social media such as LinkedIn and Instagram, if available. Moreover, we consulted Forbes to extract profiles and the net worth of each investor.\n\nIt is to be noted that while we intended to include hedge fund managers with a significant social media presence, some of the most popular names in the hedge fund industry do not own Twitter accounts. For such investors, we have ranked them earlier in the list based on their social media presence on any other social media site such as Linkedin, Instagram, or YouTube.

        "title": "3 Amazon Stock Predictions for 2024",
        "content": "In early 2023, I made three predictions for Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock investors. Let's see how I did:\n\nI predicted that Amazon's e-commerce sales would bounce back. In the three quarters reported for 2023 thus far, online sales growth has accelerated from the corresponding prior-year periods, so I'll put that in the win column. My call that Amazon would dive further into healthcare played out as well. Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical; rolled out RxPass, a monthly prescription service; and launched Amazon One Medical for Prime, offering Prime subscribers access to certain healthcare services for $9 per month. I also correctly called that Amazon would maintain its lead in cloud computing. Through the first three quarters of 2023, Amazon controlled roughly 30% of the market, on average, with Microsoft coming in at 25% and Alphabet's Google Cloud maintaining 9%. As a bonus prediction, I posited that Amazon stock would rebound from its historic lows, and boy howdy, was I right. After losing half its value in 2022, Amazon stock soared 81% in 2023, making it one of big tech's top performers.\n\nI was correct in all three of my prognostications and also scored during the bonus round, though each of those seems like a slam dunk in hindsight. Let's see if I can keep my streak going with three predictions for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon's cloud growth will reaccelerate\n\nWhile Amazon maintained its seat atop the cloud heap, its growth struggled. Since peaking in the fourth quarter of 2021, year-over-year growth has decelerated with each successive quarter. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as that was right about the time the downturn began, with the economy only recently regaining its footing.\n\nIn the third quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) finally stabilized, matching the 12% growth it generated in the second quarter. I predict that growth will continue to stabilize, before reaccelerating and marching higher in 2024, fueled by an improving economy.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon's artificial intelligence is a sleeping giant\n\nThis prediction is inexorably tied to the first. Despite improving macroeconomic conditions, last year's stock market recovery was largely uneven. The biggest winners were the companies best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity represented by advances in generative AI.\n\nEarly last year, while Microsoft and Alphabet were stealing the spotlight, releasing generative AI tools on their respective platforms, Amazon was largely absent from the conversation. That led some to conclude that Amazon was \"behind\" in the AI race, a perception that still lingers.\n\nAmazon is working to change that. Late last year, the company released Amazon Q, its own generative AI-powered digital assistant, designed to help increase productivity among AWS cloud users. Q taps into company-specific sources to answer questions, generate content, and streamline a variety of tasks. AWS also offers a wealth of generative AI models via Amazon Bedrock, as well as providing access to Nvidia's latest AI chips, the H200 Tensor Core graphics processing units.\n\nIt's important to remember that it's still early days in generative AI, as the current iteration of the technology has only been public for roughly 14 months. There's still plenty of time for Amazon to stake its claim, and as the world's largest cloud provider, it's well-placed to do just that.\n\nNot only will Amazon's cloud growth reaccelerate, but the company will become a force to be reckoned with in generative AI, with AWS as the facilitator.\n\n3. Amazon will join Microsoft and Apple in the $2 trillion club in 2024\n\nDespite a run-up of 81% in 2023, the aforementioned catalysts suggest there's still growth ahead for Amazon. There's also the company's industry-leading e-commerce platform, which has struggled in the face of high inflation. Furthermore, Amazon is a growing force in digital advertising, with ad sales that grew 23% to $32.2 billion through the first nine months of 2023, outpacing the growth of its largest rivals, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which grew 4% and 13%, respectively.\n\nAmazon's continuing dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing, coupled with its growing importance in digital advertising and generative AI, will fuel solid financial results, driving additional stock price gains in 2024, pushing its market cap above $2 trillion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) generated revenue of $143 billion. The vast majority of this, about $92 billion, was derived from online stores and third-party seller services, which are directly related to the company's insanely successful digital marketplace.\n\nIt has long been the case that Amazon's e-commerce operations were the bread and butter of the business. After all, the company was founded with the goal of selling books online, which eventually turned into consumers being able to buy just about anything they wanted from the comfort of their homes.\n\nWith so many billions in e-commerce revenue, investors may be surprised to learn that this tech titan generated 62% of its Q3 operating income from an entirely different segment. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe cloud is where the real profit lies\n\nGenerating over $23 billion in sales last quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides businesses and governments with various tech infrastructure services, like computing power, storage capacity, and database management. Compared to investing in IT tools on-site, these cloud computing customers benefit from lower costs and from having the flexibility to adjust their needs up or down at any time. This frees up capital that would otherwise be tied up in long-term projects.\n\nAWS, whose clients include Walt Disney, Verizon Communications, and Capital One, is tiny (as measured by revenue) when compared to the company overall. But its profitability is notable. The segment posted a stellar 30% operating margin in Q3, generating $7 billion in Q3 operating income. For comparison's sake, Amazon as a whole reported $11.2 billion in operating income last quarter.\n\nThis outsized profitability demonstrates the monster potential of AWS. It has long dominated the industry, with about one-third of the global market share. As it continues scaling up, it's easy to believe that margins will keep expanding. In the first quarter of 2015, AWS registered an operating margin of 17%, so it has improved over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it was discouraging to see AWS' chief rivals, Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, posting much faster revenue growth in the latest quarter. Of course, they are starting from a smaller sales base, but this is not a good trend.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy doesn't seem worried. \"We're seeing the pace and volume of closed deals pick up, and we're encouraged by the strong last couple of months of new deals signed,\" he said optimistically on the Q3 2023 earnings call.\n\nAnd zooming out, there is a ton of growth to be achieved. Grand View Research estimates that by 2030, the global market for cloud infrastructure services will be worth a whopping $1.6 trillion in annual revenue, rising at about 14% per year until then. As the clear leader in the industry, AWS is in a prime position to benefit from this trend.\n\nDon't forget about Amazon's other segments\n\nWhile AWS is certainly a major growth and profitability driver for Amazon, investors shouldn't completely ignore other divisions that are critical to the operations as well.\n\nIt's hard to envision a scenario where the online marketplace doesn't remain the focal point for the business for the foreseeable future. Management has made huge investments to bolster the company's logistics footprint to better serve customers, and this will continue to provide benefits when drawing in shoppers looking for low prices and fast shipping.\n\nThe popularity of Amazon.com has spawned another booming revenue source. Most investors might not know that Amazon currently produces the third-most digital advertising revenue in the world, behind only Alphabet and Meta Platforms. This is just another growth engine the company can lean on.\n\nNonetheless, it's almost a certainty that AWS will keep rising in importance in the years ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

The economy is still fragile, and conditions could erode, but another strong year may be ahead for the stock market.\n\nHelping fuel the market's overall gains last year were a group of investor favorite stocks known collectively as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which outpaced the broader market in 2023 by a wide margin.\n\nNvidia: Up 239% Meta Platforms: Up 194% Tesla: Up 102% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): Up 81% Alphabet: Up 58% Microsoft: Up 57% Apple: Up 48%\n\nAmong these household names, one that represents a particularly compelling opportunity for investors today is Amazon. On the heels of its robust gains last year, the stage is set, and the company will likely deliver another standout performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLingering challenges\n\nThe macroeconomic headwinds of the past couple of years amounted to something of a perfect storm for Amazon. High inflation caused a slowdown in consumer discretionary spending, and online purchases were among the first casualties. This also prompted a commensurate decline in business spending.\n\nAdvertising is one area in the budget that companies can easily and rapidly dial down or scale up -- and a broad cutback on that front weighed on Amazon's digital advertising business. Furthermore, many companies put their digital transformations -- highlighted by the shift of workloads to the cloud -- on the back burner, which caused slowing growth for Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud infrastructure business.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the effects of those issues linger, things are looking up for Amazon.\n\nThe undisputed leader in e-commerce\n\nDespite persisting unease regarding the economy, there are reasons to remain optimistic. Amazon is synonymous with e-commerce, an industry it still dominates. While the figures for 2023 have yet to be tallied, Amazon accounted for roughly 38% of all online sales in the U.S. in 2022, more than the next 14 competitors combined, according to online data provider Statista. It's unlikely the company ceded its industry-leading position, though the competition might have made some inroads. Image source: Statista.\n\nFurthermore, e-commerce sales are expected to grow by more than 9% in 2024 to $6.3 trillion, representing more than 20% of all retail sales, according to estimates provided by Insider Intelligence. As the online sales leader, Amazon will benefit from this secular tailwind.\n\nIt all \"ads\" up\n\nOne of Amazon's biggest growth drivers in recent years has been digital advertising, owing to the company's captive audience. In the third quarter, Amazon's digital advertising revenue grew 26% year over year, outperforming its largest rivals, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which grew their ad revenues by 9% and 24%, respectively.\n\nAmazon is looking to boost its ad business by showing \"limited advertising\" on its Prime Video streaming service beginning this month. Subscribers will have the option to pay an additional $3 per month to keep their viewing experience ad-free, but Amazon wins either way.\n\nFurthermore, digital advertising is expected to increase by 13.2% in 2024, after climbing more than 10% last year, according to Insider Intelligence. As the No. 3 digital ad platform in the U.S., Amazon will no doubt benefit from any acceleration in ad spending.\n\nThe clouds are lifting\n\nIn the face of economic challenges, AWS maintained its position as the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, controlling 31% of the market in Q3, according to market analyst Canalys.\n\nAfter a period of subdued growth over much of the past two years, cloud adoption is expected to reaccelerate in 2024. Research and consulting firm Gartner estimates that public cloud spending will jump 20% to $679 billion. An acceleration in cloud adoption will likely increase the fortunes of AWS.\n\nYou can't spell gains without AI\n\nLast but certainly not least, Amazon has a long and storied history of using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve its operations, and has jumped into the generative AI ring with both feet. AWS Bedrock provides users with access to all the most common AI models, allowing them to build customized AI apps of their own. It also provides access to Nvidia's latest and greatest AI chips -- the H200 Tensor Core graphics processing units (GPUs) -- as well as Amazon's own Inferentia and Trainium AI chips. This lets customers strike a balance between speed and economy.\n\nThe company recently launched Amazon Q for enterprises, a generative AI-powered digital assistant designed to help automate and streamline time-consuming and mundane tasks, thereby making users more productive.\n\nAmazon is also providing AI tools to the merchants that sell on its platform to help them succeed. The company introduced AI-powered image generation for digital advertisers while also using AI to improve search and product recommendations. Just this week, Amazon began testing a feature that lets customers ask questions about a product and receive an AI-generated response.\n\nThese most recent forays into AI provide a glimpse of Amazon's game plan.\n\nA compelling opportunity\n\nDespite the wealth of opportunity ahead for Amazon, its stock is still reasonably valued at 2 times next year's expected sales.\n\nGiven the rebound in online retail, the recovery of the ad market, the ongoing digital transformation, and the AI-inspired gold rush, now is the time to buy Amazon before the stock roars even higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks You Can Confidently Buy After a Market Downturn",
        "content": "2023 was a year of recovery after an economic downturn in 2022 triggered a dramatic sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33%. The challenging period highlighted vulnerabilities in many companies' business models as they suffered repeated revenue declines.\n\nHowever, macroeconomic headwinds also showcased the strength of companies that successfully navigated the market downturn. In 2023, the Nasdaq Composite rose more than 40%, driven by growth from a few key stocks.\n\nTech stocks have played a crucial role in the market's recovery, as advances in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing made Wall Street particularly bullish. Tech is one of the most reliable industries, with its stocks never down for long. As a result, the period after a market downturn could be one of the best times to invest in the lucrative industry.\n\nHere are three stocks you can confidently buy after a market downturn.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nShares in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) plummeted 50% in 2022 as spikes in inflation curbed consumer spending in the PC market and other areas of tech. However, the company delivered an impressive turnaround last year when its shares soared around 240%.\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia's hardware can be found powering a wide range of devices and systems from cloud platforms to artificial intelligence (AI) models, video game consoles, laptops, custom-built PCs, and more. Demand for these products is rarely down for long. Consequently, a market downturn could be the perfect time to buy Nvidia's stock at a bargain and reap the rewards over the long term.\n\nNvidia's business model is diverse. However, its biggest growth catalyst for now is likely AI. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia has achieved a powerful role in the sector with its graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips necessary to train and run AI models. In 2023, Nvidia's GPUs became the preferred chips for AI developers worldwide, leading to soaring earnings. In the third quarter of 2024 (ending October 2023), the company posted revenue growth of 206% year over year as operating income rose 1,600% thanks to soaring chip sales.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. That figure, multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45, implies a potential stock price of $1,080. If projections are correct, its stock will rise 95% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nThe company has come back strong after a market downturn, making its stock an excellent long-term investment.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) e-commerce business was also hit hard by macroeconomic headwinds in 2022. Consumer pullback led to steep declines in retail profits and a tumbling stock price. However, the company's performance last year proved why it's one of the most reliable stock investments over the long term, as it strategically brought its business back to growth.\n\nPoor market conditions led Amazon to introduce a range of cost-cutting measures, such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, laying off thousands of employees, and sunsetting unprofitable divisions like Amazon Care. The restructuring paid off, as the company's free cash flow has soared 427% over the last year.\n\nAmazon's ability to successfully navigate economically challenging conditions makes it an excellent option after a market downturn. The company is using its significant cash reserves to invest in AI and its highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company's price-to-sales ratio currently sits at an attractive 2.8, indicating its stock is trading at a value and is a no-brainer right now.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is not only a great option after a market downturn, but also during one. MSFT Chart\n\nIn 2022, while companies across tech felt the pangs of poor market conditions, Microsoft was not unscathed. However, the chart above shows that it was one of the few to still outperform the Nasdaq Composite, experiencing more moderate declines than many of its rivals.\n\nThe company's greater focus on the commercial and digital markets, such as productivity software and cloud computing, made it less vulnerable to economic declines than its peers.\n\nMoreover, in 2023, the company's shares shot up 57% as it emerged as one of the principal names in AI. Heavy investment in the market has seen Microsoft achieve a 49% stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which granted it exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry.\n\nMicrosoft has so far used OpenAI's tech to bring AI upgrades across its product lineup, including Bing, Azure, and its popular Office productivity programs. The massive user base for these platforms could see the company become the go-to for consumers and businesses everywhere looking to boost efficiency with AI.\n\nThe company's stock trades at a premium, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 36. However, with proven reliability and $63 billion in free cash flow, Microsoft has earned its high price tag. It's a screaming buy for anyone looking for a consistent long-term investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "11 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\n\nCan investing in stocks make you rich? This question is rarely posed anymore since data has overwhelmingly proved that investing in the stock markets is one of the best ways to increase your wealth over time. A report in October 2023 by the Wall Street Journal talked about the rise of \"mini-millionaires\" and how the average wealth of American families was increasing, citing data from the Federal Reserve. Mini-millionaires usually make about $150,000 and $250,000 a year. The report said between 2019 and 2022 families in the 80th to 90th percentile of the income distribution saw the biggest rise in their incomes as their median wealth increased by about 69% from 2019 through 2022, adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe report said that over 90% of these families reported owning stocks, either directly or indirectly.\n\nNeedless to say, investing in the stock market is full of crevices. You can't expect to get rich investing in low-quality stocks and random companies with no value. Investing in stocks to become rich involves patience, wise choices and sticking to traditional investing principles. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had in 2000 foreseen the changing trends in the stock market where investors were becoming impatient, expecting to make money without paying attention to the actual fundamentals of companies. But Klarman at the time had also predicted the return of traditional methods of evaluating companies before investing. In his letter to investors Klarman had said:\n\n\"If Paul Harvey's serialized radio program \"The Rest of the Story\" were applied to Wall Street, it would describe the sad denouement of many such \"story\" stocks. The unraveling of the virtuous circle of growth is not pretty, with earnings shortfalls, plunging share prices, employees with under-water options jumping ship, overzealous shareholders receiving margin calls, accounting chicanery exposed, lawsuits filed, and, to come full circle, the final insult of deletion from the relevant major market index. At this time, attractive valuation is not considered a good story. A slow growth or no growth company trading at one half or one third of its underlying value attracts no important constituency of investors. I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value.\n\nOver time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.\"\n\nStory continues Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years\n\nSeth Klarman of Baupost Group\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scoured various analyst reports and interviews to pick 11 stocks that experts believe can make one rich in the next 5-10 years.\n\n11. ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 16\n\nChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the stocks that can make one rich in the next few years according to Wall Street analysts. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch last year set a $27 price target on the stock. ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) was trading at $2.11 as of January 4. Here is why the analyst likes the stock:\n\n“Of note, in our view, is that the company’s substantial product development cycle is slowing and management continues to expect material operating leverage as R&D spend moderates. Second, demand continues to be robust as EV sales grow in multiple geographies driving charging infrastructure buildout. Third, the company is well capitalized as it drives toward positive adjusted EBITDA in F2Y4 and manages working capital needs for growth. We remain constructive on shares as we anticipate the company will enjoy both top-line growth and margin expansion in coming quarters.”\n\nIn addition to CHPT, investors are also piling into high quality names like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n10. Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TARS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nBiopharma company Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TARS) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks that will make you rich in the next five to ten years. The average price target for the stock over the next one year is $43.25.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Francois Brisebois, who also has a $43 price target on the stock, explained his bullish thesis on Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TARS) in the following words, according to TipRanks:\n\n“Commercially led by eye care veteran CCO Mottiwala (ex-VP Marketing Allergan Eye Care), TARS is well-positioned to develop a new category, eyelid health. We are particularly encouraged by market research revealing an intent to prescribe for demodex blepharitis (DB) of 93%. As awareness grows, our conviction in TP-03’s market potential is reinforced. Additionally, we believe TP-03 could benefit from key differences between DB and dry eye disease (DED) markets. Finally, although we currently don’t value TARS’ pipeline, we believe it should not be dismissed and see multiple opportunities for growth and monetization.”\n\n9. AES Corp (NYSE:AES)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nUtility company AES Corp (NYSE:AES) ranks 9th in our list of the best stocks that will make you rich in the next 5 to 10 years according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nSarat Sethi, DCLA managing partner, believes the stock AES Corp (NYSE:AES) has strong earnings growth potential for the next three to five years. The analyst also praised the stock’s dividend yield.\n\nMassif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Given interest rates’ elevated state, it is perhaps unsurprising that our utility exposure has fared poorly for us this year. We should have hedged the exposure sooner with a Utility ETF short, but we did not do that until the third quarter, after much of the damage was already done. As noted above, our Utility exposure is second only to our materials exposure in terms of negative impact on the portfolio across both the third quarter and the YTD periods. This is primarily driven by our investment in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), which was down roughly 26% in the third quarter and 47% YTD. Our other utility exposure is up for the year, including our short position, which, as noted, was put on in the third quarter, and it is probably something we should have had on the books for the entire year.\n\nWe attribute, for right or wrong, the entirety of the sell-off in AES to the interest rate environment. Chart overlays are always tricky, so one should not read too much into them, but as a quick sense check of the claim, if one inverts the move-in rates for a generic 10-year US government bond and overlay it with AES stock price YTD, you get the following:..” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n8. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 68\n\nSarat Sethi of DCLA managing partner likes Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) as a stock to buy and hold for the next few years because of its strong cash flow, growing dividend and a “very strong management team.”\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The most significant stake ($1.42 billion) in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is owned by Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”\n\n7. Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 73\n\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) is one of the stocks that has the potential to gain a lot in value over the next few years, according to Sarat Sethi, DCLA managing partner. The analyst said while talking to CNBC that Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) is set to gain on the back of an increase in demand for EVs and copper.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the company. Like FCX, hedge funds are loading up on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is perhaps one of the most divisive stocks out there, with some analysts saying the stock will fall while others saying the stock would skyrocket.\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Invest believes Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could hit $2000 by 2027. Wedbush's Dan Ives, who is also a notable Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull, recently said in a program on CNBC that there are signs that demand for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles remains strong. He said that it’s important to differentiate between demand trends in the broader EV industry and demand for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. In addition to Tesla, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the top stocks hedge funds and Wall Street analysts are buying.\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Best Get Rich Quick Stocks To Buy 13 Cash-Rich Small Cap Stocks To Invest In 15 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5 Years According to ChatGPT,\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Tech stocks have a reputation for delivering significant and consistent gains over the long term. The innovative nature of the market has created an ever-expanding environment and one of the best places to invest.\n\nThe chart below illustrates this, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector rising significantly higher over the last decade than the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500. ^NDXT Chart\n\nWall Street has grown particularly bullish about tech stocks over the last year thanks to advances in budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. And these industries appear to be only just getting started.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector posted a gain of 55% year over year, but could have a lot more to offer new investors going forward. Here are two tech stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is probably already on your radar as a potential investment. The company has a powerful role in tech, with positions in search engines, online video sharing, cloud computing, digital advertising, and more.\n\nIn fact, Alphabet boasts nine products with more than 1 billion users, with the top three being Google Search, Android, and Chrome. The success of its various services has seen Alphabet's annual revenue soar 75% since 2019 and its operating income rise 108%, outperforming competitors Microsoft and Apple in both metrics.\n\nWhile Alphabet is probably best known for its role in search engines, its main business lies in digital advertising. The tech giant's massive user base presents almost endless advertising opportunities, with Alphabet responsible for an estimated 27% of the $740 billion market.\n\nAdvertising spending dipped slightly alongside macroeconomic headwinds in 2022. However, Alphabet's third quarter of 2023 suggests the market is back on track. The company's revenue was up 11% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $980 million. Growth was mainly owed to an 11% increase in Google Search revenue and a 12% rise in its YouTube Ads segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is on a promising growth trajectory, topping $77 billion in free cash flow last year. The company has vast financial resources, which it is employing to invest heavily in AI. The company unveiled a highly anticipated AI model called Gemini last December, and has plans to venture into the chip market. Alphabet has the brand power and significant cash reserves to see big gains from AI over the long term. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart shows Alphabet is potentially one of the biggest bargains in tech right now. Its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow are lower than those of some of the most prominent tech firms, indicating its stock offers the most value.\n\nAlongside a consistently expanding business, Alphabet is among the best tech stocks for long-haul investors.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was hit particularly hard by an economic downturn in 2022, with its stock plunging 50% throughout the year alongside steep declines in its e-commerce profits. However, the company delivered an impressive turnaround in 2023, which proved why its stock is one of the best long-term investments.\n\nShares of Amazon rose more than 80% last year as its retail business returned to profitability and its cloud platform expanded in AI. After a challenging 2022, the company started restructuring its business with a priority on profit growth.\n\nCost-cutting measures such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, thousands of layoffs, and sunsetting unprofitable divisions like Amazon Care have seen the tech firm's free cash flow soar 427% over the last year.\n\nIn Q3 2023, Amazon posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, outperforming analysts' forecasts by $1.5 billion. Much of the growth came from its retail business. Its North American segment hit over $4 billion operating income, significantly improving on the $412 million in losses it posted in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAmazon's ability to successfully navigate economically challenging conditions has made it one of the most reliable stocks in tech. Meanwhile, its highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, and its heavy investment in AI will likely keep its shares trending up for decades.\n\nAmazon's stock is made more attractive by its price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 2.9. This metric is calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its trailing 12-month revenue. The lower the figure, the more value a stock offers. Compared to Microsoft and Apple's P/S ratios of 13 and 7, Amazon is a bargain and an excellent long-term buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Today, Still Below Their 2021 Highs",
        "content": "2023 has come and gone, leaving the stock market's tech sector buzzing with the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Some stocks have skyrocketed in response to the AI-based sea change, but a few were left behind -- and not always for good reason.\n\nThree of The Motley Fool's top tech experts got together to share their most affordable AI plays in this market. Read on for the straight dope on their clear-eyed picks: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Applied Materials(NASDAQ: AMAT). All three are trading significantly below their all-time highs of 2021, and they are hungry for a comeback in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSomeone needs to make all those AI chips, you know\n\nAnders Bylund (Taiwan Semiconductor): Semiconductor-making giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (often called TSMC) has been through a lot in the last couple of years, and most of the changes have been helpful.\n\nThe global shortage in semiconductor manufacturing capacity that started in 2021 effectively ended at the tail end of 2023. The inflation pressure that held back consumer-level demand for hot-off-the-electronics-factory gear such as new cars and smartphones also fell back. TSMC started construction of several new manufacturing facilities in places like Arizona, Japan, and China, slated to open between 2024 and 2026. If this capacity increase doesn't put the final nail in the shortage's proverbial coffin, I don't know what it takes. The company arguably held on to its chip-making technology lead despite fresh competition from Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), aiming for test runs of the 2-nanometer process node in 2025. The three largest chip foundries are running neck-and-neck in the eternal race to provide the world's most advanced manufacturing process, cramming in more processors per silicon wafer with real benefits to both production cost and processing performance.\n\nGranted, the sailing wasn't all smooth. Intel's unexpected entrance on the third-party manufacturing stage added new headwinds to TSMC's business. Ongoing political tensions between China and America don't help either, though the company is working around the problem by positioning new facilities far away from the Chinese sphere of influence, such as Arizona.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut I'm still talking about a dominant player in an important industry, with tremendous growth prospects as the world economy wriggles out of the inflation-tinted straitjacket it donned in 2021. Taiwan Semiconductor's stock trades at merely 15 times forward earnings and 8.4 times sales. Share prices stand approximately 20% below their all-time highs, recorded in February of 2021 and again in January 2022.\n\nI've been a fan of Taiwan Semi and its stock for decades. The company never ceases to surprise me with its iron-fisted grip on the chip-making market and terrific financial results. The stock has gained roughly 1,000% since I first looked into it in 2006, quadrupling the returns of the S&P 500 market index over that span -- and after all that, TSMC's stock still looks affordable and poised for further growth right now.\n\nThe chip industry should experience a glut of orders as companies of every stripe search for a foothold in the explosive AI industry, keeping TSMC's production lines more than busy for years to come. So I highly recommend grabbing a few TSMC shares before the stock price takes off again.\n\nE-commerce is so back, and the cloud will follow suit in 2024\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Amazon): Many investors found solace after the bear market with a \"flight to safety\" to the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks: Big tech platforms that kept growing and outperformed the market overall in 2023.\n\nHowever, not all the Mag7 have been all that magnificent in recent years. Take Amazon, for example, which remains nearly 20% down from the all-time highs last set in late 2021.\n\nI believe 2024 could be the year Amazon finally achieves those peaks again. The e-commerce and cloud computing leader is in the midst of a multiyear process of right-sizing its operations to boost profitability. In e-commerce, it's been filling its distribution centers with robotics for years. And in a further push to monetize its marketplace, Amazon has been rolling out advertising features for third-party merchants. Amazon already optimizes ads using AI, and late in 2023, it introduced AI-generated images for its marketers to use for promoting products.\n\nAnd on the cloud computing side (where Amazon Web Services is still the cloud market leader), Amazon has reported that its customer spending seems to be solidifying after a year of trying to cut costs and conserve cash. And though it was late to the generative AI party, Amazon Web Services has been installing Nvidia GPUs into its data centers as well to keep pace with the times.\n\nIndeed, even outside research indicates that the cloud market is poised for a monster year in 2024. Tech researcher Gartner thinks global cloud spending will rise 20% this year to around $680 billion. That could be a portent of good things to come for Amazon stock.\n\nAmazon currently trades for about 28 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for 2024 free cash flow -- which implies this profit metric could skyrocket about 50% this year as Amazon's optimization work starts to pay off. I remain a buyer of Amazon stock at these levels.\n\nBilly Duberstein (Applied Materials): Applied Materials is only about 10% below its late 2021 highs, but look for this all-star semiconductor leader to break that resistance level and eventually move higher.\n\nApplied's business has a terrific combination of growth, profitability, and shareholder returns that should allow it to compound earnings well into the future. And compound earnings is the recipe for eventual new highs in the stock market.\n\nApplied's great financial characteristics come from it being the most diversified semiconductor equipment company in the world, with leadership in several key technologies spanning leading-edge chips, lagging-edge specialty chips, and memory.\n\nThat diversification was on full display over the past year, when Applied's leading-edge and memory equipment sales went into a downturn. However, sales of lagging-edge specialty equipment usually used for producing auto and industrial chips remained strong. So while front-end wafer fab equipment is projected to decline about 15% in 2023 according to industry group SEMI, Applied actually managed to grow its semiconductor equipment sales 4.8% in its last fiscal year.\n\nWhile impressive, some investors believe the previously strong industrial and auto sectors are now going into their downturn, so Applied's stock has plateaued a bit in recent months. But Applied's leading-edge tools, especially for AI chips and high-bandwidth memory, should get a boost in the near future.\n\nIn a recent analyst note last week, analysts at Keybanc Capital markets boosted their outlook for several AI-related stocks based on current channel checks. While Applied wasn't one of the stocks upgraded, its leading-edge tools do help produce the chips from each of the three stocks highlighted. So leading-edge tool growth should offset any weakness in the specialty sector. That's especially true as IDC projects the overall semiconductor market to bounce back with 20% growth in 2024.\n\nMoreover, Applied isn't resting on its laurels. It's a forward-thinking company perpetually looking for new growth avenues and the next major technology breakthrough. For instance, the company is currently looking to apply its atomic-level manufacturing talents to augmented reality. This past week, Applied and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) announced a collaboration for multiple generations of Google's new lightweight augmented reality glasses platform. And last year, Applied announced it would be investing $4 billion in its groundbreaking EPIC R&D center. The EPIC center will be a nexus of collaboration between university researchers, Applied, and the company's chipmaking customers to speed up the pace of innovation.\n\nApplied's profitability allows it to invest in new ventures like these, somewhat future-proofing its business, all while returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and a rising dividend. It shouldn't stay below its all-time high much longer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Every portfolio should have some \"forever\" stocks -- companies so good that they're worth holding for a very, very long time.\n\nThey're like keepsakes -- oftentimes passed down from parent to child. They can be the bedrock of true generational wealth. So, what types of stocks fit that bill? Well, let's have a look at three that I consider forever stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nTech giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a mainstay of my investment portfolio and will remain so for many years to come, for three key reasons.\n\nRelentless focus on the customer: This was the creed of founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, and it still permeates the company today. Look no further than the company's mission statement: \"Amazon's mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company.\" Innovation: Amazon has developed numerous innovations, ranging from its sprawling fulfillment network to its vast array of data centers that make it the global leader in cloud computing services. Delivering shareholder value: The company constantly reevaluates its finances and workforce, with a focus on balancing shareholder returns and reinvestment in the business. Over the last 10 years, Amazon shares have returned 659%, meaning a $10,000 investment in early 2014 would be worth nearly $76,000 as of this writing. AMZN Total Return Level Chart\n\nAMZN Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nIn short, Amazon is a great company. What's more, with analysts expecting it to grow sales by 11% this year as its long-term investments in regional distribution combine with a rebound in enterprise cloud spending.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nNext up is Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), the legendary maker of iconic beverage brands such as Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Fanta, Schweppes, and Minute Maid, among many others.\n\nThe reason I intend to own Coca-Cola stock forever is that the company delivers consistent earnings growth. Over the last five years, Coca-Cola has grown its net income from $6.7 billion to $10.8 billion. Quarterly earnings per share (EPS) have increased at an average rate of 19%. Moreover, free cash flow -- the lifeblood of a mature, dividend-paying company -- has grown from $6.0 billion to more than $10.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat, in turn, has allowed Coca-Cola to increase its dividend consistently. In fact, the company has raised its dividend each year, dating back 62 years -- representing one of the longest such streaks on Wall Street.\n\nAnd what a dividend it is! The company pays $1.84 per share -- good for a dividend yield of 3.1% at the current share price. That's more than twice the 1.4% average yield of the S&P 500 index.\n\nTo see how important those dividend payments are over the long term, consider this chart which shows the growth of a $10,000 investment in Coca-Cola over the last 30 years. KO Chart\n\nThe company's steadily growing payouts make an enormous difference, boosting the total return of the investment from $56,000 to more than $116,000 (with dividend reinvestment).\n\nIn short, Coca-Cola remains a solid stock that investors can rely on for the very long-term -- a nearly perfect forever stock.\n\nNvidia\n\nFinally, there's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The reason to own Nvidia forever is simple: Technology is the future.\n\nNever has this been more obvious than right now. Whether it's artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving, advanced robotics, or gene editing, it's clear that the next wave of technological breakthroughs will have one thing in common: They will require tremendous amounts of computing power.\n\nThat means demand for advanced semiconductors -- the type used in the supercomputers and server farms of today and tomorrow -- will continue to grow massively in the years to come.\n\nNvidia, which many experts believe makes the best and fastest chips for high-performance computing, stands to benefit enormously from the rise of AI and other cutting-edge tech innovations.\n\nThat's why Wall Street analysts are raising their forecasts for its future sales at a breakneck pace. The consensus among analysts is that Nvidia will report over $92 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2025. Over the last 12 months, it reported $45 billion in revenues.\n\nNevertheless, Nvidia isn't a perfect forever stock for everyone. Income-seeking investors will be better off looking elsewhere, as will value-oriented investors and those who lack the stomach for stocks with high volatility.\n\nHowever, for long-term investors who a ready to hold on through the inevitable volatility, Nvidia is a forever stock with a high ceiling, and one worth seriously considering.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the22 Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks.\n\nHedge funds on average underperformed the market in 2023 as investors continued to pull out money amid rise in bond yields, overall volatility and a changing financial landscape. But the $3.4 trillion hedge fund industry saw many blockbuster returns from select hedge funds. For example, SoMa Equity Partners posted a massive 62% gain in 2023, according to a Reuters report. Many notable hedge funds like Coatue Management of Philippe Laffont, Millennium Management of billionaire Israel Englander,  Anson Funds' Investments Master fund posted double-digit returns. Chase Coleman's Tiger Global, which was devastated in 2022 due to its tech investments, rebounded strongly in 2023 and posted  a 28.5% gain in the period, with most of the gains coming in the last quarter of the year, helped largely by tech stocks. While there's no shortage of hedge funds that performed extremely poorly during the year, you have funds like Mulvaney Capital Management which reportedly posted a 51.22% return, according to Reuters.\n\nThis mixed bag of results and the average underperformance of the hedge fund industry when compared to the S&P 500's strong returns in 2023 only prove Insider Monkey's long-held thesis about the hedge fund industry, recently summarized by its founder and research director Dr. Inan Dogan:\n\n\"Hedge funds, usually, underperform the market during bull markets and outperform during bear markets. Most investors don’t understand that hedge funds are “hedged”. When the S&P 500 Index returns 20+% like it did in 2021, it is a certainty that hedge funds will underperform. It is also a certainty that hedge funds will significantly outperform the market when the market declines 18.2% like it did in 2022. Hedge funds lost 4.25% in 2022 according to HFR. That’s an outperformance of 14 percentage points. \"\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Given its partnership with OpenAI and leading position in the cloud, Microsoft is well-positioned to profit from the boom in AI. However, due to Microsoft’s tremendous scale and diversification, the company is not dependent upon AI for its success. Microsoft’s diverse portfolio of software and cloud offerings ensures the company will thrive even if the next hot thing, like AI, fizzles out. In this way, Microsoft is emblematic of our broader investing approach. We seek to benefit from powerful trends, but we do so with an eye toward managing risk and limiting downside in case the future turns out to be less rosy than hoped for.”\n\n21. Ken Griffin\n\nTop Stock Pick: Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX)\n\nWorth about $35 billion today, Ken Griffin started Citadel LLC back in 1990. As of December 2022, the fund had assets under management worth over $62 billion.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Microsoft was the biggest position of the fund but since it would be a repetition, we focus on the fund's second-biggest holding, Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX). Citadel had a $1.1 billion stake in Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX).\n\nBaron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added to our position in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. We wrote about Boston Scientific last quarter. We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products used to treat atrial fibrillation, among others. The company held an Investor Day during the quarter at which management established financial targets for the 2024– 2026 period calling for an organic sales CAGR of 8% to 10%, 150 basis points of margin expansion and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improved free-cash-flow conversion. We think this growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.”\n\n20. John Paulson\n\nTop Stock Pick: Horizon Therapeutics Public Ltd Co. (NASDAQ:HZNP)\n\nJohn Paulson, who has a net worth of about $3.5 billion as of January 11, rose to fame in 2007 when he earned a whopping $4 billion, thanks to his bets against the U.S. subprime mortgage lending market via credit default swaps.\n\nPaulson founded Paulson & Co. in 1994. The hedge fund's biggest position as of the end of September was Horizon Therapeutics Public Ltd Co. (NASDAQ:HZNP) in which the fund had a $243 million stake.\n\n19. David Einhorn\n\nTop Stock Pick: Green Brick Partners Inc (NYSE:GRBK)\n\nDavid Einhorn founded Greenlight Capital in 1996. The fund returned 36.6% in 2022, easily outperforming the S&P 500’s fall of 18.1%. Since its launch in 1996, Greenlight Capital has returned 2,358.3% for an annualized return of 12.8% net. Over the same timeframe, the S&P 500 gained 864% for an annualized return of 8.9%.\n\nThe fund's biggest stock holding is Green Brick Partners Inc (NYSE:GRBK).\n\nHere is what Greenlight Capital has to say about Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) fell from $56.80 to $41.51 during the quarter. The company announced second quarter earnings of $1.63 per share, which far exceeded consensus estimates of $1.18 per share. Full-year estimates for 2023 and 2024 rose from $5.16 and $5.54 to $6.13 and $6.49, respectively. However, the market has become concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates, and most homebuilding stocks reversed a portion of the gains achieved earlier this year.”\n\n18. Jim Simons\n\nTop Stock Pick: Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nJames Harris Simons is an American billionaire, award-winning mathematician and hedge fund manager who founded Renaissance Technologies in 1982. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, Jim Simons’ secretive Medallion Fund — closed for outsiders — posted a whopping $55 billion in profit over the last 28 years, about $10 billion more profitable than hedge funds of giants like Ray Dalio and George Soros.\n\nRenaissance Technologies' biggest stock holding as of the end of September 2023 was Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)in which the fund had a $1.5 million stake.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our health care holdings also fared well. The sector has been largely overlooked in 2023 amid AI exuberance, but its defensiveness is looking more salutary as tighter monetary policy begins to sap market sentiment. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) shares rose on continued unprecedented demand for GLP-1s, which treat diabetes and obesity, and of which Novo Nordisk is one of two major providers. GLP-1s represent the largest commercial opportunity and investable theme in health care.”\n\n17. Cathie Wood\n\nTop Stock Pick: Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nCathie Wood is one of the most followed hedge fund managers in the Wall Street and is known for her bets on innovative, high-growth companies. In 2014, Wood founded ARK Invest. Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund ($ARKK) rallied about 70% in 2023. This was the fund's third best performance in a year since its inception.\n\nThe biggest position of ARK Invest as of the end of September 2023 was Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in which the fund had a $1 billion stake.\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.”\n\n16. Guy Spier\n\nTop Stock Pick: Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class A (NYSE:BRK.A)\n\nGuy Spier has risen to fame over the past few years, thanks to his obsession with Warren Buffett and his value principles. The author of the famous value investing book The Education of a Value Investor famously paid $650,100 along with Mohnish Pabrai to have lunch with Warren Buffett.\n\nSpier founded the Aquamarine Fund after leaving investment banking career. The fund's biggest position as of the end of the third quarter was, you guessed it, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class A (NYSE:BRK.A) as the fund owned 140,600 shares of the conglomerate.\n\n15. Michael Burry\n\nTop Stock Pick: Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA)\n\nMichael Burry is almost always in the news thanks to his blunt predictions which often warn about recessions and market crashes. The Big Short investor rose to fame after he correctly bet against the housing bubble in 2007.\n\nIn 2000, Michael Burry founded Scion Capital. The fund's biggest stock holding as of the end of September was Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA) in which the fund had a $7.6 million stake.\n\n14. Leon Cooperman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Energy Transfer LP Unit (NYSE:ET)\n\nBillionaire Leon Cooperman is the chariman and CEO of Omega Advisors, which had about $1.9 billion under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe biggest stock holding of the fund was Energy Transfer LP Unit (NYSE:ET), in which the fund had a $167 million.\n\n13. Mario Gabelli\n\nTop Stock Pick: Herc Holdings Inc (NYSE:HRI)\n\nBillionaire Mario Gabelli is the man behind GAMCO Investors, Inc., formerly known as Gabelli Asset Management Company. Gabelli is a value investor and has impressed the market with high returns over the past several years. Talking to Columbia Business School, the 81-year-old investor talked about the essence of value investing:\n\n\"Value investing isn’t focused on short-term market movements. It’s about finding the ignored and unloved companies that nobody covers for whatever reason, with a good business, solid management, and a good price. But you do need to evaluate new trends as they come up. AI, for example, might accelerate the problem of income inequality. Also, there are food, water, and energy shortages. There’s the way capital is allowed to be allocated on a global basis — the regulatory hurdles and the challenges to the free market’s system of allocation. So you have to figure out how to bridge all that.\"\n\nThe biggest stock holding of GAMCO as of the end of the third quarter of 2023 was Herc Holdings Inc (NYSE:HRI).\n\n12. David Tepper\n\nTop Stock Pick: Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper is the man behind Appaloosa Management, a Florida-based hedge fund. Tepper, who also owns Carolina Panthers, managed to post about 18% to 19% gains in 2023, according to a report by Institutional Investor.\n\nTepper's top two holdings as of the end of September were Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). But since these two stocks are already mentioned in our article as the top picks of other hedge funds, let's look at the third biggest position of the billionaire. Tepper's fund had a $477 million stake in the ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n“Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Nvidia. Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments, most notably its core e-commerce business, while Meta saw accelerated revenue growth and share gains in online advertising.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.”\n\n11. Paul Tudor Jones\n\nTop Stock Pick: Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI)\n\nBillionaire Paul Tudor Jones  founded Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980. As of the end of the September quarter the hedge fund had a portfolio worth about over $9 billion.\n\nThe biggest stake of the company was in Activision Blizzard which is now going under the ownership of Microsoft. Jones' fund had a $284 million stake in the company as of the end of the September quarter.\n\n10. Dan Loeb\n\nTop Stock Pick: PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)\n\nDaniel Seth Loeb started Third Point in 1995. The fund today has $10.8 billion in assets for sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, corporate & public pensions, high-net-worth individuals, and employees. The fund returned -2.2% on a NAV basis in September 2023, compared with a -4.3% return for the MSCI World Index and a -4.8% return for the S&P 500 Index.\n\nAs of the end of the September 2023 quarter, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) was the biggest position of the hedge fund. Third Point reported owning 57 million shares of the company.\n\n9. Bill Ackman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nBill Ackman is currently in the news for his relentless outburst against Harvard University and reports alleging his wife was involved in academic plagiarism. Regardless of this hullaballoo, Ackman is among the top money managers in the world, having started Pershing Square Capital in 2004. In 2023, Pershing returned  26.7%.\n\nAs of the end of the September quarter, the hedge fund's biggest position was Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG), in which the fund had a $1.7 billion stake. Over the past one year the stock has gained about 51%.\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the consumer discretionary sector, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) proved a detractor as investors were disappointed in management’s decision not to push additional menu pricing, which resulted in full year guidance falling short of expectations. However, we believe this is just a timing mismatch as their value proposition relative to peers leaves room for continued strong pricing power.”\n\n8. Ken Fisher\n\nTop Stock Pick:Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWorth $7.9 billion today, Ken Fisher is one of the most renowned hedge fund managers in the world. Ken Fisher founded Fisher Investments back in 1979. Fisher Investments today manages over $236 billion in assets. Ken Fisher is bullish on the market. He recently wrote in an article for that The Globe and Mail that he sees \"double-digit gains for both S&P 500 and the MSCI World Index, with tech and big growth stocks leading early on.\"\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest holding of Fisher Investments as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The fund owned a whopping $9.2 billion stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n“We meaningfully reduced our exposure to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2023. Apple is the largest company in the world and produces terrific products that engage users for hours each day. Despite the company’s size, ubiquity and relevance, however, Apple’s growth has slowed dramatically. Its fiscal 2023 earnings were flat with those of 2022. Apple trades at 30x earnings; sustaining that multiple will require a meaningful acceleration in revenues. While such an improvement is possible, we do not see any obvious catalysts for adding tens of billions of dollars to Apple’s topline. Consequently, the risk-reward skews negatively.”\n\n7. Ray Dalio\n\nTop Stock Pick: Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\n\nRay Dalio in 1975 founded Bridgewater Associates which went on to become the largest hedge fund in the world. According to Forbes, the hedge fund has over $124 billion in assets under management. According to Bloomberg, Bridgewater's flagship hedge fund lost about 7.6% in 2023, while its long-only All Weather fund climbed 10.6% in the period.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) was the biggest holding of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater as the fund reported owning a $700 million stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, Coca-Cola trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is likewise at ~27x P/E, with earnings only ~12% higher than a decade ago (or a ~1% annual growth rate). This equates to a mere 3.3% – 3.7% earnings yield.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”\n\n6. Chase Coleman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nHaving worked under legendary investor Julian Robertson, Chase Coleman rose to higher ranks in the money management industry with speed thanks to Robertson giving Coleman about $25 million after he shuttered his own fund Tiger Management. The famous tiger cub founded Tiger Global in 2001. According to Forbes, Coleman's worth today is about $5.7 billion.\n\nTiger Global's biggest stock position as of the end of September 2023 was Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), in which the fund had a $2.7 billion stake.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META):\n\n“Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and Nvidia. Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments, most notably its core e-commerce business, while Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: My Top 7 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "The macroeconomic challenges of the past couple of years are beginning to fade, and investors are looking to the future. After the Nasdaq Composite plunged in 2022, suffering its worst performance since 2008, the index enjoyed a robust recovery in 2023 and gained 43%.\n\nThere could be more to come. Since the Nasdaq Composite began trading in 1972, in every year following a market recovery, the tech-heavy index rose again -- and those second-year gains averaged 19%. The economy is the wildcard here, though, and it could yet stumble in 2024. But historical patterns suggest that this could be a good year for investors.\n\nRecent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) helped fuel the market's rise last year and will likely drive further gains in 2024. While estimates vary wildly, generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the next few years, according to a study by McKinsey Global Institute. This will result in windfalls for many companies in the field.\n\nHere are my top seven AI stocks to buy for 2024 before the Nasdaq reaches new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster child for AI innovation. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are already the industry standard chips in a growing number of AI use cases -- including data centers, cloud computing, and machine learning -- and it quickly adapted its processors for the needs of generative AI. Though it has been ramping up production, the AI chip shortage is expected to last until 2025 as demand keeps growing. The specter of competition looms, but thus far, Nvidia has stayed ahead of the competition by spending heavily on research and development.\n\nThe company's triple-digit percentage year-over-year growth is expected to continue into 2024. Despite its prospects, Nvidia remains remarkably cheap, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) helped jump-start the AI boom when it invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, shining a spotlight on generative AI. The company's tech peers jumped on the bandwagon, and the AI gold rush began. Microsoft seized the advantage, integrating OpenAI's technology into its Bing search and a broad cross-section of its cloud-based offerings.\n\nIts productivity-enhancing AI assistant, Copilot, could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027, according to some analysts, though estimates vary. This and other AI tools already caused Azure Cloud's growth to outpace rivals in Q3, and Microsoft attributed 3 percentage points of that growth to AI.\n\nThe stock is selling for 35 times forward earnings, a slight premium to the price-to-earnings ratio of 26 for the S&P 500. Even so, that looks attractive given Microsoft's growth potential.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has long used AI to improve its search results and the relevance of its digital advertising. The company was quick to recognize the potential of generative AI, imbuing many of its Google and Android products with increased functionality and announcing plans to add new AI tools to its search product. Furthermore, as the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider, Google Cloud is suited to offer AI systems to its customers.\n\nA collaboration between Google and Alphabet's AI research lab, DeepMind, gave birth to Gemini, which the company bills as its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Google Cloud's Vertex AI offers 130 foundational models that help users build and deploy generative AI apps quickly.\n\nAdd to that the ongoing rebound in its digital advertising business, and Alphabet's valuation of 27 times earnings seems like a steal.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nThere's a popular narrative that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was late to recognize the opportunities in AI, but the company's history tells a different story. Amazon continues to deploy AI to surface relevant products to shoppers, recommend viewing choices on Prime Video, schedule e-commerce deliveries, and predict inventory levels, among other uses. Most recently, Amazon began testing an AI tool designed to answer shoppers' questions about products.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) stocks all the most popular generative AI models for its cloud customers on Bedrock AI, and is also deploying its Inferentia and Trainium purpose-built AI chips for accelerating AI on its infrastructure.\n\nNow that inflation has slowed markedly, more consumers and businesses are patronizing Amazon, and AI will help boost its fortunes. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) also has a long and distinguished history of using AI to its advantage. From identifying and tagging people in photos to surfacing relevant content on its social media platforms, Meta has never been shy about deploying AI systems.\n\nUnlike some of its big tech rivals, Meta doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service to peddle its AI wares, but it quickly developed a workaround. After developing its open-source Llama AI model, Meta made it available on all the major cloud services -- for a price. Furthermore, Meta offers a suite of free AI-powered tools to help advertisers succeed.\n\nImproving economic conditions will no doubt boost its digital advertising business. And with the stock trading at just 22 times forward earnings, Meta is inexpensive relative to its opportunity.\n\n6. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has two decades of experience building AI-powered data analytics, and was ready to meet the challenge when AI went mainstream. In just months, the company added generative AI models to its portfolio, layering these atop its data analytics tools. The launch of the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has generated a lot of excitement. \"Demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past 20 years,\" said management.\n\nWhen fears of a downturn were higher, businesses scaled back on most nonessential spending, including data analytics and AI services, but now, demand for those services is rebounding, particularly in relation to generative AI.\n\nLooking ahead one year, Palantir sports a PEG ratio of less than 1, which helps illustrate how cheap the stock really is.\n\n7. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) made a splash by bringing electric vehicles (EVs) into the mainstream. In 2023, its Model Y topped the list of the world's best-selling cars by a comfortable margin, the first EV to do so. However, the magnitude of its future prosperity will likely be linked to AI. The company's \"full self-drive\" system has yet to live up to its name, but success on that front would be a boon to shareholders.\n\nIn Ark Investment Management's Big Ideas 2023 report, the firm estimates that robotaxis could generate $4 trillion in revenue in 2027. With an estimated 2.7 million vehicles on the road collecting data, Tesla could hold an insurmountable technological edge, if it cracks the code on autonomous driving. Some analysts estimate the software is already worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nFinally, 6 times forward sales is a pretty reasonable valuation for an industry leader with a treasure trove of data.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJeff Bezos Investments in 2024: 11 Companies Bezos Is Investing In. To see more such companies, click Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: 5 Companies Bezos Is Investing In.\n\nRising interest rates and overall macroeconomic volatility kept a lid on startup funding in 2023 as investors remained in a wait and see mode about the future and preferred to invest in safe and already mature companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). A detailed report on the state of venture capital and future predictions from Cambridge Associates cited data from PitchBook which said that median change in valuations for follow-on financing rounds for early-stage companies in 2023 was 1.7x, the lowest change in any year since 2016. However, the Cambridge Associates report said that while 2023 was a bad year, low investments in 2022 and 2023 means there would be ample capital for VC funds to invest in worthy startups in 2024. The report also said most of the venture capital investments in 2024 would be directed towards AI. While Cambridge Associates said AI is not a new thing, it expects that the huge advancements in the domain after the generative AI boom would result in real innovation growth in the next few years.\n\nJeff Bezos' Thoughts on Innovation\n\nBut for innovation-focused billionaires like Jeff Bezos, who is worth about $177 billion as of January 20, the state of venture capital markets and what could happen in the next few months rarely matters. In an interview with senior tech writer Peter Burrows, Bezos said that there's no \"bad time\" to innovate when asked about Bezos' history of getting criticized for spending extravagantly on innovation.\n\n\"You should be doing it when times are good and when times are tough—and you want to be  doing it around things that your customers care about.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFood technology. Environment. Biotech. AI. Neurotechnology. These are the main themes in Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy as evident from his long list of investments.\n\nWhat matters to Bezos, according to him, is that his company is truly focusing on innovation and he tries not to get bogged down by stock price movements.\n\n\"We have three all-hands meetings a year, and I'll tell people that if the stock is up 30% this month, please don't feel you are 30% smarter. Because when the stock is down 30% a month from now, it's not going to feel that good to feel 30% dumber. When the Internet bubble burst, our stock went from over 100 a share to a low right after September 11 of 6. Throughout that entire period, the fundamentals of the business continuously improved. You can see the stock price going in the opposite direction of the fundamentals. So it wasn't that worrisome to us, \" Bezos said in the interview with Burrows.\n\nWhile Amazon's success over the years has proved that Bezos's innovation philosophy is right, it's interesting to take a look at the top investments of Jeff Bezos' investment company Bezos Expeditions. Billionaires like Bezos are always on the lookout to find new, promising startups in emerging domains that can grow to become giants in the future like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: Companies Bezos Is Investing In\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we took a look at Bezos Expeditions, Pitchbook, TechCrunch and some other reliable sources to find out which startups Bezos has been investing in. From these companies we selected 11 important companies in which Bezos invested in over the past few years. We gave preference to Bezos' most recent investments.\n\n11. Anthropic\n\nEven though Jeff Bezos is not a direct investor in Anthropic, the company behind ChatGPT rival AI assistant Claude, Anthropic deserves an entry in our list since Amazon decided to invest up to $4 billion in the company in 2023. According to the deal, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will initially invest $1.25 billion in Anthropic  and the investment would later be increased to $4 billion.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) management talked about Anthropic in its Q3 earnings call:\n\nRecently, we announced that leading LLM maker Anthropic chose AWS as its primary cloud provider and will use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train and deploy its future LLMs. As part of this partnership, AWS and Anthropic will collaborate on the future development of Trainium and Inferentia technology. We believe this collaboration will be helpful in continuing to accelerate the price performance advantages that Trainium and Inferentia deliver for customers. In the middle layer which we think of as large language models as a service, we recently introduced general availability for Amazon Bedrock which offers customers access to leading LLMs from third-party providers like Anthropic, Stability AI, coherent AI 21 as well as from Amazon’s own LLMs called Titan, where customers can take those models, customize them using their own data but without leaking that data back into the generalized LLM, have access to the same security, access control and features that they run the rest of their applications within AWS all through a managed service.\n\nIn the last couple of months, we’ve announced the imminent addition of Meta’s Llama 2 model to Bedrock, the first time it’s being made available through a fully managed service. Also through our expanded collaboration with Anthropic, customers will gain access to future Anthropic models through Bedrock with exclusive early access to unique features, model customization and the ability to fine-tune the models. And Bedrock has added several new compelling features, including the ability to create agents which can be programmed to accomplish tasks like answering questions or automating workflows. In these early days of generative AI, companies are still learning which models they want to use which models they use for what purposes and which model sizes they should use to get the latency and cost characteristics they desire.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n10. Synchron\n\nNeurotechnology and brain  Synchron ranks 10th in our list of the companies Jeff Bezos has been investing in.  In 2022, Synchron raised $75 million in a funding round led by ARCH Venture Partners. In addition to Bezos Expeditions, Bill Gates' investment firm also took part in the round. Last year it was reported that Synchron was testing a technology (The Synchron Switch) that would allow people with no or very limited physical mobility to operate technology such as cursors or smart devices using their mind.\n\n9. Arrived Homes\n\nIn a budget as little as $100, you can own a property and then rent it out. That's the promise and business model of Arrived Homes, a fractional real estate platform company which raised about $160 million in funding and debt financing, including two infusions from Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions.\n\nLast year, Arrived Homes launched the Arrived Single Family Residential Fund which would allow investors to invest on their own schedule without having to wait for individual properties to launch.\n\n8. NotCO\n\nNotCo is a Chilean food technology company that uses algorithms and AI to find out the best combinations of plants to create alternatives to animal-based foods.\n\nIn 2022, NotCo raised another $70 million in fresh funding, led by Princeville Capital. Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions, which had already invested in the firm, again took part in the new funding round, along with Tiger Global, L Catterton, Kaszek Ventures and MercadoLibre CEO Marcos Galperin.\n\n7. Cloud Paper\n\nCloud Paper is one of the most unique names in the list of companies Jeff Bezos has been investing in. Cloud Paper aims to impact the traditional paper industry. Cloud Paper makes bamboo-based tree-free toilet paper which it sources from \"responsibly-managed forests.\"\n\nIn 2022, Cloud Paper raised $5 million in a funding round in which Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions took part. Cloud Paper planned to launch commercial-size toilet paper and touchless dispensers. While major companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) always steal the show because of their clout and size in the investing space, wise investors are always on the lookout to find smaller, promising companies like Cloud Paper to invest in.\n\n6. Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN)\n\nCalifornia-based EV company Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) ranks 6th in our list of the top Jeff Bezos investments in 2024. According to some reports Amazon owns about 10% to 15% stake in Rivian.\n\nIn 2019, Amazon signed a deal with Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) to have at least 100,000 electric delivery vans for itself on the road by 2030.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) during this period was Daniel Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners which owns a $327 million stake in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN).\n\nIn addition to Rivian, hedge funds are also investing heavily in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHere is what Baron Global Advantage Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc., a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer, continued their volatile trading, and after declining during the first half of 2023, rose 45.7% during the third quarter. Rivian’s unit economics are improving as a result of several factors: i) the company’s production rate is increasing, which enables it to better absorb fixed costs; ii) Rivian is ramping-up the usage of more price effective technologies, such as LFP batteries and its in-house developed motor, Enduro; and iii) the company is benefiting from renegotiated supplier agreements, as its scale and purchasing power have significantly increased over the last few years. Management expects continued progress in profitability ahead as Rivian further scales production. We remain shareholders and believe that the release of Rivian’s new smaller SUV dubbed R2, which is planned for early 2024, would enable the company to compete in the higher volume SUV segment, and significantly expand its addressable market. On the liquidity front, we expect the company to raise additional funds to support its longer-term business plans.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: 5 Companies Bezos Is Investing In.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 High-Growth Canadian Dividend Stocks To Invest In 14 Money Making Stocks To Invest In 13 Cash-Rich Small Cap Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "The Nasdaq Just Did Something It Has Done Only 5 Times Before. History Says a Big Move in Stocks Could Follow in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) is an index comprising about 3,500 stocks, many of which come from the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. To that end, the Nasdaq is often considered a benchmark for growth stocks because many of its components are on the cutting edge of various technologies and consumer trends, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and e-commerce.\n\nInvestors rotated away from growth stocks as post-pandemic inflation scorched the economy. The Nasdaq tumbled deep into bear market territory in 2022, falling as much as 36% from its high.\n\nThat drawdown was largely driven by recession fears arising from aggressive monetary policy. Specifically, the Federal Reserve has battled inflation by raising its benchmark interest rate at its fastest pace since the 1980s. Many economists feared (and some continue to fear) that policymakers could trigger a recession by tightening credit conditions too quickly.\n\nHowever, the Nasdaq shook off those fears and moved higher last year as signs of economic resilience and excitement about artificial intelligence improved market sentiment. The index soared 43.4% in 2023, one of its best performances in history. Prior to that, the Nasdaq had achieved an annual gain exceeding 40% only five times since its inception in 1971.\n\nHistorically, annual gains exceeding 40% have portended more upward momentum in the Nasdaq. Of course, investors should never put too much weight on such forecasts simply because each situation is unique. The last few years have been defined by fallout from a global pandemic, and there is no precedent for such an event. Even so, historical patterns are still worth consideration. Here's what investors should know.\n\nHistory says the Nasdaq could move higher in 2024\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite returned 43.4% in 2023, marking the sixth time the index has increased more than 40% in a calendar year. The chart below shows the last five events and details the Nasdaq's return 12 months later.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear Nasdaq Return Nasdaq Return (12 Months Later) 1991 56.9% 15.5% 1999 85.6% (32.3%) 2003 50% 8.6% 2009 43.9% 16.9% 2020 43.6% 21.4% Median 15.5%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAs shown above, the Nasdaq has returned a median of 15.5% during the 12-month periods following an annual gain exceeding 40%. To add context, the Nasdaq has ticked down about half a percentage point this year, so the implied upside is about 16% through the remainder of 2024.\n\nInvestors should view that number as little more than a guess. The combination of a global pandemic, the fiercest inflation in four decades, and aggressive interest rate hikes make the current situation unique. As such, the Nasdaq may not perform as historical data suggests. But there is one more pattern investors may find interesting.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may be done raising interest rates\n\nThe Federal Reserve has hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be over. In fact, the latest projections from policymakers imply three 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2024. Futures investors are even more optimistic. The CME Group's Fed Watch tool -- which uses pricing data from futures contracts to estimate the probability of future rate hikes and cuts -- currently shows a 70% chance of at least six 25-basis-point cuts in 2024.\n\nIf credit conditions indeed loosen in the coming year, that shift in monetary policy would promote borrowing and spending among businesses and consumers. In turn, that should lead to robust economic expansion and strong growth in corporate revenues and profits. Investors get excited by those prospects, so the Nasdaq has historically risen sharply following the end of interest-rate-hike cycles.\n\nTo elaborate, the Federal Reserve has guided the economy through six rate-hike cycles since 1983. The Nasdaq returned a median of 20% during the 12-month period following the last rate hike in those cycles. For context, the Federal Reserve last increased its benchmark rate on July 27, since which time the Nasdaq has advanced 6%. That leaves implied upside of roughly 14% through July 2024.\n\nOf course, that presupposes that the Federal Reserve is indeed done raising interest rates. But that outcome is not guaranteed. Inflation actually reaccelerated to 3.4% in December, up from 3.1% in November, so policymakers could ultimately decide to tighten credit conditions further.\n\nPatience is key to making money in the stock market\n\nInvestors should avoid strategies based on market timing. Not even the smartest economists and Wall Street strategists know what the year ahead will bring. Some pundits are forecasting the worst crash in decades, while others see only a modest risk of recession. But those concerns become less pressing with a long-term mindset.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell 56% during the bear market that accompanied the Great Recession, and it took more than three years for the index to regain its record high. But the Nasdaq has still gained 424% since the drawdown started. In other words, investors who bought a Nasdaq Composite index fund the day the bear market began have still seen annualized returns of 10.8% during the last 16 years.\n\nThe lesson here is simple: Patience is the key to making money in the stock market. Investors who buy individual stocks should carefully research each company before buying shares, paying close attention to growth prospects and valuation.\n\nCompanies primed to benefit from artificial intelligence are a good place to start. That includes software vendors like Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG), cloud services providers like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and chipmakers like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Those companies are members of the Nasdaq Composite, and all but Datadog rank among its 10 largest components.\n\nAlternatively, investors can save themselves some work with an index fund strategy, either in lieu of or in addition to individual stocks. A Nasdaq Composite index fund like the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite ETF(NASDAQ: ONEQ) would tap directly into the Nasdaq's returns. Investors should also consider an S&P 500 index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO). Warren Buffett has often recommended that strategy. But no matter the strategy, patience is the key to making money.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Walmart\n\nWhen our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks That Can Make You Richer in 2024",
        "content": "Most basketball players don't play the game just because they like to dribble. They want to win. In the same vein, most investors don't buy stocks just because they like a company's products. They want to make money.\n\nMaking money is a lot easier when you invest in companies with strong underlying businesses and exceptional growth prospects. Here are three unstoppable growth stocks that could make you richer in 2024.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nOwning shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2023 would have made you plenty of money. The stock soared by nearly 81%. I think that Amazon's impressive momentum can continue this year.\n\nOne reason behind Amazon's sizzling gains last year was its improving profitability. The company's earnings skyrocketed by more than 240% year over year in the third quarter. This impressive jump was due in large part to Amazon's focus on streamlining its operations to boost profits. I expect those efforts will continue to pay off in the coming quarters.\n\nThe surge in interest in generative AI stood out as another major tailwind for Amazon in 2023. Don't think this AI boom will be only temporary. I predict that Amazon will benefit from it in all areas of its operations for years to come.\n\nIn particular, more organizations are likely to move their apps and data to the cloud to harness the power of generative AI. This should work to the advantage of Amazon Web Services, which ranks as the leading cloud services provider based on market share.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) is sometimes referred to as the \"Amazon of Latin America.\" There's certainly a similarity in the two stocks' trajectories: Shares of MercadoLibre vaulted nearly 86% higher last year.\n\nMercadoLibre runs a huge e-commerce platform that operates in 18 Latin American countries. This platform ranks as the market leader based on unique visitors and page views in every major country in the region.\n\nThe company is also the leader in fintech in Latin America with its Mercado Pago business unit. This is a major growth market for MercadoLibre, as evidenced by total payment volume in online payments soaring by triple digits in 2023 Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'm optimistic about MercadoLibre's newer ventures as well. The company's credit card total payment volume recently topped $1 billion for the first time. It also launched Mercado Play, an advertising-supported streaming service. MercadoLibre's short video platform, Clips, is gaining momentum. Overall, this business and stock appear to be unstoppable.\n\n3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) was the worst performer of these three stocks in 2023. However, that's not anything to be ashamed of considering that the biotech stock rose by 41% last year after delivering a 31.5% gain in 2022. I feel good about Vertex's prospects this year, too.\n\nJust days ago, the company picked up its second U.S. regulatory approval for Casgevy. The gene-editing therapy now has the green light to be used to treat both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. It will take a while for Casgevy's revenue to ramp up, but Goldman Sachs projects peak annual sales of $3.9 billion.\n\nTwo other new products could be on the way soon. Vertex hopes to move forward with regulatory filings for its non-opioid pain drug candidate VX-548 and a cystic fibrosis combination therapy featuring vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, and deutivacaftor. Both could be blockbusters if approved.\n\nIn the meantime, sales for Vertex's current cystic fibrosis franchise should continue to grow. The company's goal is to also launch yet another new drug in the not-too-distant future -- inaxaplin, as a treatment for APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). This could open up a huge new market for Vertex. AMKD affects more patients worldwide than cystic fibrosis. If approved, inaxaplin would be the first therapy to treat the underlying cause of the disease.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 16, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Roar Higher in 2024: 2 Surefire Growth Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "All three major indexes slipped into bear territory in 2022, and ever since, one question has been on investors' minds: When will the next bull market arrive? It's impossible to answer that question with 100% accuracy, but a couple of things offer us reason to be optimistic that a bull market may be on the way.\n\nFirst, bear markets always lead to bull markets, so down times are temporary. Second, a look at history shows us the Nasdaq Composite has a good chance of roaring higher in 2024. The index surged 43% last year, surpassing gains of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, which climbed 13% and 24%, respectively. And a look at Nasdaq's performance over time shows that after every year of rebounds from a bear market, the index has gone on to climb for a second year.\n\nIn fact, after each annual loss of more than 10%, the Nasdaq went on to gain an average of 56% over the following two years. This shows that, if the index follows its pattern so far, the Nasdaq has plenty of room to run this year, and this makes now a great time to invest in quality growth stocks. These are companies that have shown their ability to increase earnings over time, and these players also offer solid long-term prospects. So, by scooping up shares of these companies, you could score a win in the near term and over time. Let's check out two surefire growth stocks to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) revenue and profit have soared over time, and so have other key measures like free cash flow and return on invested capital. This shows the technology giant has what it takes to consistently turn increasing revenue into profit -- and make wise investment decisions. AAPL Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nAAPL Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts.\n\nThe share price has followed, helping the company reach a market value of more than $2.8 trillion. It's clear Apple has a track record of success.\n\nAll of this is thanks to the company's brand strength. Customers keep coming back to snap up the latest iPhone or Mac and haven't been easily lured away by rival products. This strength represents a moat, or competitive advantage, that should keep the momentum going.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn top of this ability to keep current customers loyal, Apple also continues to gain new fans. In the most recent quarter, for example, half of Mac and iPad buyers were new to those particular products. And Apple continues to innovate, with its latest product -- the Apple Vision Pro spatial computer -- set to launch early next month.\n\nToday, more than 2 billion people around the world use Apple devices, and this leads me to the subject of Apple's next big growth driver. I'm talking about the services Apple offers these device users -- from cloud storage to digital content. In the most recent quarter, services revenue reached a record high, and that should continue thanks to this enormous (and growing) number of Apple users. Even better, Apple's services margins are significantly higher than product margins -- 70% vs. 36% in the recent quarter.\n\nAll of this means Apple, even after gains of 48% last year, has a lot of fuel in the tank. And in a market favoring growth, this top stock could easily rocket higher.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in two markets set to grow in the double digits this decade: e-commerce and cloud computing. And the company is likely to maintain its dominance thanks to moves it's made over the past couple of years. A difficult 2022 that led to Amazon reporting its first annual loss in nearly a decade prompted these moves.\n\nRising inflation weighed on Amazon's costs and on its customers' wallets. So Amazon decided to revamp its cost structure and transform itself into a stronger company that not only could recover from difficult times but could excel in better times.\n\nAmazon focused on boosting efficiency across its fulfillment network, investing in high-growth areas and supporting its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers by offering them lower-cost tools during tough economic times. All of these efforts have been bearing fruit, with Amazon shifting from billion-dollar outflows of cash and declines in operating income to growth. In the latest quarter, operating income quadrupled, and the company reported free cash flow of more than $21 billion.\n\nMoving forward, the company's move to a regional fulfillment model from a national one could continue to lower Amazon's costs and increase revenue. By dispatching packages from centers closer to your home, Amazon spends less money on the task, and you receive your order more quickly. Amazon is also introducing an ad-supported tier to its Prime Video offer, a move that could add billions to revenue, analysts predict.\n\nAs for AWS, Amazon's investment in artificial intelligence (AI) may make the company a winner in the potential AI revolution. That's big news considering AWS generally has driven profit at Amazon.\n\nAfter an 80% increase last year, Amazon, like Apple, has plenty of potential for more gains. And that's why, if the Nasdaq follows its historical pattern in 2024, this market giant could once again roar higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The World Economic Forum is underway in Davos, Switzerland, and many prominent government and business leaders are in attendance, including Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy. Fortune magazine's Alan Murray was at the conference as well and took the opportunity to speak with Jassy and ask him about business trends, specifically the top opportunity and the top challenge for the coming year.\n\nAccording to Jassy, the opportunity and the challenge involve the same thing: generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nGenerative AI helps computers to create things on their own with just a prompt from the user. It could be creative content meant to be consumed, such as a written document or an original image. Or it could be something with more utility, such as a computer program. Hundreds of companies are working on all of this and/or working with all this right now.\n\nThe biggest challenge these companies will face comes down to priorities, according to Jassy. This is a fast-changing space, and businesses don't always know how to best spend money. \"Are they better off continuing with the modernization of their technology platform?\" Jassy asked. \"Or should they put all their engineering resources into generative AI?\"\n\nA generative AI strategy requires both an approach to platform modernization and engineering resources. And this is why a stock to watch when it comes to generative AI is none other than Amazon itself.\n\nHow Amazon stock is leading the charge\n\nWhile Amazon is a massive e-commerce operation, 74% of its profit comes from Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- its cloud computing platform. And with this platform, businesses using it can execute a generative AI strategy.\n\nIt starts with using Amazon's AWS for the computing power itself and also utilizing the more than 60 generative AI applications that Amazon is reportedly building on its own. Moreover, the company offers a service called Bedrock, which allows businesses to build their own generative AI apps as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuge companies such as Booking Holdings, GoDaddy, and United Airlines all already use Amazon's AWS for their generative AI strategies.\n\nWith only 12% growth in the third quarter of 2023, growth for Amazon's AWS has slowed recently. However, the company has remaining performance obligations of $133 billion, and most of this has to do with AWS. This clearly shows that Amazon stock is leading the charge in this important space.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 low-stress jobs for seniors. We have also discussed the latest statistics on seniors returning to jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Low-Stress Jobs for Seniors.\n\nAs individuals age, they may prioritize a work environment that offers reduced stress levels to enhance overall well-being and quality of life. Many seniors look forward to retirement as a phase of life that comes with relaxation, leisure, and spending time with loved ones. Consequently, opting for low-stress jobs helps them maintain a healthier work-life balance and transition smoothly into retirement. According to popular beliefs, dietitian and gardeners are considered two of the most stress-free jobs for seniors.\n\nIs 70 Too Old To Work?\n\nAge should not be the sole determinant of one's ability to work. Many individuals remain active, productive, and engaged in their careers well into their 70s too. Infact, around 20% of Americans, as per a recent T. Rowe Price study, have chosen to \"unretire,\" opting for full or part-time employment. The average retirement age has risen to 61, with retirees now working longer due to economic uncertainty and pandemic-related factors. By March 2022, 1.5 million retirees had rejoined the labor force. The recent stock market volatility has negatively impacted retirement accounts, prompting some to return to work to recoup losses and secure additional income. Financial incentives have also player a key role, with 48% citing the need to work for financial reasons.\n\nAdditionally, returning to work offers social and mental health benefits, as 45% of respondents in the T. Rowe Price poll re-entered the workforce for interpersonal and emotional reasons. Overall, 57% of retirees express a desire to continue working. It is interesting to note that the motivations differ along gender and marital lines, with women and single retirees more likely to cite income as their primary motivator, while men often highlight social connections.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre Any Companies Hiring Seniors?\n\nDespite these developments, AARP reports that workplace age discrimination is at its highest since 2003, with 78% of older workers experiencing or witnessing it. Despite these challenges, the current tight labor market, with two open jobs for every worker, makes older workers more in-demand. Companies are increasingly recognizing the benefits of hiring mature workers, as research shows they are more engaged and less likely to quit.  For example, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has hired former Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) product chief Panos Panay to lead its devices and services unit, replacing longtime Amazon devices head Dave Limp. Panay, oversaw Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s profitable Windows operating-system business and the Surface line of devices. It is also true that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), as a technology giant, is known for its commitment to diversity and inclusion, which also translates into their focus on hiring workers of all age groups.\n\nSpeaking of the company, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has recently entered a partnership with the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US., comprising 60 unions and representing 12.5 million workers. The collaboration aims to address rising concerns about AI-induced job losses. This alliance marks the first of its kind between a technology company and a labor organization. Starting next winter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) will provide AI training to union workers and leaders, covering trends, technology development, and challenges. The partnership also involves labor summits to gather worker feedback on AI, with the AFL-CIO and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) proposing policies for AI training, including tech apprenticeships.\n\nOn the other hand, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) Philippines has announced plans to increase the hiring of senior citizens and persons with disabilities (PWDs) in Manila. The fast-food chain aims to recruit individuals who pass their screening for a training program approved by the Public Employment Service Office (PESO) of Manila and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).\n\nSince the launch of McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)‘s Alternative Work program in 2019, 62 senior citizens and PWDs have been hired. In 2023, the company promised to hire over 500 PWDs and senior citizens across different locations in Metro Manila, with each of the 250 stores nationwide potentially having up to two seniors or PWD staff members.\n\nTo read more about McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), see our article about the Top 20 Countries With the Most McDonald’s Restaurants. 25 Low-Stress Jobs for Seniors\n\nGoodluz/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the low-stress jobs for seniors, we identified 40 jobs with three major characteristics; jobs with predictable workload, jobs with a supportive environment, and jobs with flexible scheduling and remote options. Subsequently, we gauged the collective perception of stress levels associated with these 40 jobs by consulting Reddit as our primary reference.

        "content": "Finding millionaire-maker stocks could be likened to finding a needle in a haystack!\n\nThe upcoming decade may be turbulent. Not only will we grapple with a building geopolitical tension globally. But also, worries stemming from climate change and economic malaise are pressing. It’s a sentiment that’s been a subject of concern, reflected from the ongoing conversations at Davos. Yet, that doesn’t mean investors should stay out of the market completely.\n\nHowever, tough times allow the cream to rise to the top. So, investors look to double and triple their earnings over the next few years. In fact, some of the past decades most prolific growth stocks will carry on well into the future. Companies that are already dedicating huge resources to budding tech trends will be best placed to benefit from growth in that area.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, smaller players can jump in now, emerging as millionaire-maker stocks. These companies will lay out a roadmap for the future. Therefore, investors must look critically at the expected path and decide whether or not it will be feasible.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s no secret that PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is having some difficulty righting the ship. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t one of the millionaire-maker stocks.\n\nThe group’s underlying operating margin guidance was lowered twice as the group grapples with growth in its less-profitable unbranded business, Braintree. These teething pains, though, are short-term. And investors willing to wait them out will be in a strong position once the group turns things around.\n\nAlso, PayPal is working on ways to improve margins at Braintree to capitalize on growth without sacrificing bottom line gains. Additionally, the group is improving performance in it’s legacy, higher-margin, branded business. PYPL is updating its service with a one-click button, bringing the customer experience into the 21st century.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayPal’s valuation reflects the uncertainty ahead. So, if you believe in the group’s ability to tweak its business and bring margins along for the ride, outsized gains lie ahead.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a sprawling business that continues to evolve. The company’s original draw was being a first-mover in the e-commerce space. Since then, the group has grown to become a force in the cloud computing space. Now, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is responsible for the bulk of the group’s bottom line.\n\nSo, this places Amazon in a strong position as cloud continues to expand. Also, it allows the group to pounce on trends that will grow out of our increased reliance on cloud computing. One that’s been on the tip of everyone’s tongue lately is AI. Amazon has plenty of ways it will be able to roll out the technology to benefit its business. From supercharging its ad targeting to offering cloud customers AI-integrated services, Amazon stands to be one of AI’s biggest winners.\n\nDarktrace (DRKTF) An image of the word cybersecurity overlaid over a pixelated background, images of locks and shields and virus icons surrounding it\n\nSource: BeeBright / Shutterstock\n\nUK-based Darktrace (OTC:DRKTF) is using AI to improve cybersecurity. At the center of two lucrative trends, it’s a good pick among millionaire-maker stocks.\n\nCycbersecurity has become a top concern among policymakers and business owners alike. As we transition further into the cloud, the risk of online theft and tampering gains importance. Darktrace is hoping to service that need with an AI-powered cybersecurity offering.\n\nAs a relatively new player, the group’s got some work to do. It’s operating margins are still in the mid-single digits, and research and development for this tech-heavy offering isn’t cheap. Plus, investors are expecting a lot of the company. With a P/E above 50, any missteps could create volatility. However, Darktrace is improving profitability. And, if it can continue to beef up margins, it offers some impressive potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That suggests Tepper and his fund's investment choices are worth studying.\n\nAs of the September quarter, Tepper had 28.2% of his Appaloosa portfolio invested in just three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks: 8.8% in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), 9.4% in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and 10% in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). That level of asset allocation is a clear sign of high conviction.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these three brilliant AI stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has a strong presence in two semiconductor markets: graphics chips for gaming and professional design and data center accelerators (graphics processing units or GPUs) for complex workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics, and it holds 80% to 95% market share in AI computing.\n\nNvidia has extended its ability to monetize both markets with subscription software and cloud services. Omniverse is a virtual design and simulation platform for developing 3D and robotics applications, as well as training autonomous vehicles. DGX Cloud is an AI application development platform comprising infrastructure, software, and pre-trained machine learning models. Many investors mistakenly see Nvidia as nothing more than a chipmaker, but that description fails to account for its growing software and services business. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino says Nvidia's \"software capabilities provide an incredible competitive moat.\"\n\nIn recent years, Nvidia has broadened its data center portfolio with networking platforms and central processing units (CPUs), both purpose-built for AI workloads. Networking revenue nearly tripled over the past year, and Nvidia is well positioned to take share in CPUs given that it holds 95% market share in data center GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, the graphics processor market is forecast to increase by 28% annually through 2030, while the AI market is forecast to increase by 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at annual sales growth exceeding 25% through the end of the decade. Even in that context, its current valuation of 30.4 times sales looks pricey, but I think patient investors willing to hold the stock for at least five years can buy a small position today.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three markets: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Specifically, it operates the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe as measured by sales volume. Amazon is also the largest retail advertiser in the U.S. and the third-largest ad tech company in the world. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nThat last point is particularly relevant. To quote Argus analyst Jim Kelleher, \"As the leading provider of infrastructure-as-a-service and other cloud services, AWS is uniquely positioned in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market.\" Indeed, the company is a recognized leader in cloud AI developer services, and its product pipeline is packed with AI innovations.\n\nAmazon Bedrock became generally available in September. That service provides pre-trained machine learning models and development tools that help businesses build generative AI applications. More recently, the company announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant that can create content and surface insights across data sources and enterprise systems like Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce, and ServiceNow.\n\nGoing forward, retail e-commerce sales are forecast to increase by 8% annually through 2030, while the ad tech and cloud computing markets are forecast to expand by 14% annually during the same period. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit annual sales growth through the end of the decade, which makes its current valuation of 2.9 times sales look quite reasonable.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has a strong presence in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. The company accounts for more than 16% of software-as-a-service spending, nearly double the market share of its closest competitor, due to its leadership position in office productivity and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Similarly, Microsoft Azure accounts for 23% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending, second only to Amazon Web Services.\n\nMicrosoft is adding AI capabilities to its enterprise software to create new monetization opportunities. Microsoft 365 Copilot is a generative AI assistant that automates workflows across office productivity applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Similarly, Copilot for Dynamics 365 automates workflows across ERP applications for sales, marketing, customer service, and supply chain management.\n\nMicrosoft is also investing heavily in AI across its cloud computing business. Azure is the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI, and it's the only cloud platform that provides access to pre-trained models from OpenAI, including the GPT models that power ChatGPT. Businesses can use those models to build custom generative AI applications. JPMorgan Chase analysts believe \"Microsoft's investment into OpenAI, which started years ago, could potentially prove to be some of the best money ever spent.\"\n\nGoing forward, enterprise software-as-a-service and cloud computing sales are forecast to grow at 14% annually through 2030. That gives Microsoft a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. In that light, its current valuation of 13.3 times sales looks a bit pricey. I think patient investors can buy a small position today, but waiting for a cheaper price may be the most prudent course of action.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "4 worrying trends in tech that are fueling Google and Amazon layoffs",
        "content": "Technology jobs were once synonymous with job security. But after last year, one of the biggest for layoffs in over a decade, combined with the rise of potentially job-killing artificial intelligence, a bleak horizon hovers over the humans in the technology industry who are now at risk of losing their livelihoods.\n\nWith the exception of the pandemic-driven job cuts in 2020, last year saw the highest yearly total of tech job cuts since the Great Recession, with companies cutting more than 720,000 jobs from their budgets, according to a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc., a job market research company. And that’s continued into the first month of 2024, with Google, Amazon and smaller tech firms announcing further cuts in recent weeks.\n\nBut why are companies slashing jobs now? A drive for profitability, the remains of the pandemic hiring hangover, rapidly developing AI and—somewhat ironically—slowing inflation all play a part, according to industry watchers, while the timing can be blamed on the corporate budget calendar. But there's a silver lining, with the still-tight labor market meaning laid-off techies should be able to find work elsewhere.\n\nCost-cutting as Google and Amazon search for profit\n\nGoogle was clear in its job-cut announcement this week that it was cutting several hundred workers to further reduce costs. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in a memo that the company wanted to invest more in emerging areas, including AI, while cutting costs elsewhere. “We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,” he wrote in a memo confirmed by Fortune. A company spokesperson characterized the cuts as “responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities” and said “a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better.” Some Google employees pushed back against this rationale, with members of the Alphabet Workers Union blasting the company’s “senseless, misguided corporate decision making” in a press release.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther multi-billion-dollar tech companies, like Amazon, also announced hundreds of employee cuts from its media divisions, including Prime Video, Amazon MGM Studios, video streaming platform Twitch, and Audible, its audiobook and podcast division. After tens of thousands of cuts last year, which hit areas seen as less essential to the company’s bottom line including voice-assistant Alexa, this month's cuts likewise attempts to slash costs in the high-cost, lower-profit area of content, where Amazon is the number-three spender after rivals Netflix and Disney.\n\nPandemic hiring boom still deflating\n\nAnother reason tech giants can keep reducing their ranks of employees is because their employee pools are still quite deep, after the “wild hiring spree” that many big companies embarked on during 2021 and 2022, as Challenger said. Last year’s cuts were a result of that spree, when many tech companies trimmed down their workforces after realizing they over-hired in prior years. With the latest cuts, some of those companies are realizing they didn’t cut enough in the first rounds.\n\nFrom hiring to layoffs, “tech is one of the areas that has seen the quickest turnaround,” Challenger said.\n\nAfter the pandemic boom, companies are also buckling in for slower growth ahead, with interest rates staying higher for longer—which also plays into the renewed focus on profitability. “As with many other companies in the tech space, we are now sizing our organization based upon the current scale of our business,” Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote last week, adding that his company is erring on the side of caution with “conservative predictions of how we expect to grow in the future.”\n\nRelatedly, the rise of AI in other parts of the tech world has also made the climate frostier for technology hires. Since the massive popularization of AI chatbot ChatGPT, companies have been focused on hiring AI-adjacent roles in an arms race with competitors to get ahead of what’s believed to be the next tech boom. At the same time, they’re downsizing non-AI areas to manage their expenses and keep their businesses profitable. And AI’s feared job-killing aspects could have ramifications here, too, although it’s only playing a small role at the moment, Challenger said. Companies said AI was responsible for 4,000 cuts last year, per the report, but it “is something we’re concerned about for the future,” Challenger said.\n\nFalling inflation is a bad sign\n\nIronically, the falling inflation that has been a boon for consumers is also a factor in the tech layoffs, according to Challenger. As of last month, annual inflation is around 3%, substantially lower than its 6% rate at the start of the year. But because prices are no longer rising as quickly, this makes it harder for companies to raise the cost of their services, as customers, whose paychecks are also stymied by inflation, may not be willing to pay more for them, Challenger said.\n\n“It’s harder for companies to increase their prices as they have been,” while also paying for increased labor costs, he said. “So this inflationary cycle is one of the main culprits for these layoffs.”\n\nIt’s never great to find out you’re losing your job, he said, but explained that this period is better than most because “unemployment is still below 4%, and a lot of people that lose their jobs now have a high likelihood of finding more work pretty quickly.”\n\nThe right timing: layoffs are not just for year-end\n\nThere's another reason for the timing of cuts in January, and that’s simply the corporate budget calendar. Job cuts tend to spike in December and January as companies prepare for structural changes heading into the new year, economist Rachel Sederberg told USA Today.\n\n“A lot of firms are reaching their fiscal year-end,”  Sederberg, senior economist at labor markets analytics firm Lightcast, told the outlet. “They're taking a hard look at what's going on their balance sheets as well as how the business is performing, and they make decisions along those lines. And sometimes that has implications for workers.”\n\nChallenger told Fortune that “fiscal year-ends have shifted over time,” which allows some companies to refrain from cutting workers right before or after the holidays. That’s a bittersweet development for workers, since it can mean the pain of layoffs extends deeper into a new year than before.\n\nIn December, job cuts were down by 24% from the previous month and marked the second-lowest monthly cuts in 2023. Compared to December 2022, this year’s cuts are down by 20%. Challenger confirmed that more cuts should be expected at least into the first quarter of the new year.\n\nPriorities in profitability\n\nRelated sectors, like media, have also seen more cuts as companies shift focus on profitability in a tough economic climate.\n\nJob cuts in media industries have boomed even more than the rest. Last year, the industry scraped over 21,400 jobs, up more than 460% from about 3,750 jobs cut during the same period in 2022. With an exception of 2020, it’s the most jobs the industry has slashed since 2009, which saw over 22,000 jobs cut.\n\nIn a round of layoffs in November, online publisher Vox Media cut 4% of its staff. Earlier in March, the company slashed 7% of its workforce. Conde Nast, which publishes magazines like Vogue, GQ and Vanity Fair, fired 5% of its employees in November. This week, Sports Illustrated said it would cut its entire newsroom, while staff at the Los Angeles Times walked out in protest of \"substantial\" job cuts that the paper's owner had promised.\n\nLooking ahead, Challenger said that the cuts are expected to continue into the new year. “We’ve seen job cuts increase over every sector in the past year,” he said. “These three have just seen the most this year.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Could Twilio Become the Next Amazon?",
        "content": "Twilio(NYSE: TWLO) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) can be considered the David and Goliath, respectively, of the cloud services market. Twilio's cloud platform processes text messages, voice calls, and videos for mobile apps. Instead of building those features from scratch, developers can outsource those features to Twilio with a few lines of code.\n\nAmazon's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform. Its customers can rent computing power and storage from its platform instead of buying lots of servers or building their own data centers. AWS also integrates other data processing and development tools into its platform.\n\nTwilio was notably co-founded by Jeff Lawson, who helped develop the technology that would eventually evolve into AWS during his time as a technical product manager at Amazon. During his time at Amazon, Lawson recognized the growth potential of dedicated cloud services for mobile apps -- and that idea became the basis for creating Twilio. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwilio is still a baby compared to Amazon, but could it grow into a cloud titan over the next few decades? Let's look back at its post-IPO trials and tribulations to find out.\n\nIt's gone on a wild ride since its public debut\n\nTwilio went public at $15 per share on June 23, 2016, and it closed at its all-time high of $443.49 on Feb. 18, 2021. At its peak, its enterprise value reached $70 billion -- or 25 times the revenue it would go on to generate in 2021.\n\nAt the time, investors were dazzled by Twilio's explosive growth rates. From 2015 to 2021, its revenue soared at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 60% from $167 million to $1.76 billion. That feverish growth was largely driven by the increased integration of voice calls and text messages into mobile apps, but it was also fueled by its acquisitions of smaller companies like Beepsend and Segment.\n\nToday, Twilio's stock trades at about $72 with an enterprise value of $10 billion -- which is just over 2 times the sales it's expected to generate in 2024. Twilio's stock tumbled as its revenue growth cooled off, its gross margin shrank, and rising interest rates compressed its valuations. It also failed to achieve its own ambitious long-term growth targets.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring its investor day presentation in October 2020, Twilio claimed it could grow its organic revenue by at least 30% annually through 2024. Its revenue actually increased 42% organically (and 61% as reported) in 2021, but rose just 30% organically (and 35% as reported) to $3.8 billion in 2022. It eventually abandoned its 30% growth target last year, and analysts expect its reported revenue to only rise 8% in both 2023 and 2024.\n\nBy comparison, AWS' sales rose 29% to $80.1 billion in 2022 and 13% year over year to $66.6 billion in the first nine months of 2023. It's generally a bright red flag when an underdog is growing at a much slower rate than the market leader.\n\nAre Twilio's high-growth days over?\n\nTwilio's growth slowed down as the macro headwinds forced companies to rein in their spending on cloud services. It also faced fierce competition from similar services like MessageBird, Bandwidth, and Ericsson's Vonage.\n\nTo make matters worse, it's generally difficult for Twilio to lock in its customers because it only charges usage-based fees -- which are paid whenever its service is accessed -- instead of selling stickier subscription plans. Meanwhile, its margins are being squeezed by rising carrier fees, which telecom companies now charge third-party apps to access their networks.\n\nTwilio also runs its services on AWS' backbone instead of its own cloud infrastructure platform. Therefore, it probably won't evolve into a cloud giant like AWS without spending billions of dollars to build its own cloud infrastructure.\n\nAs Twilio's growth cooled off, it authorized a $1 billion buyback plan last February -- which was a troubling move because it strongly suggested it was running out of fresh ways to expand its business. It was also an odd decision to plow so much cash into buybacks when the company remains deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. To top it all off, Twilio's recent layoffs, intense pressure from activist investors, and Lawson's recent resignation from the CEO position all strongly indicate the company could struggle to grow over the next few years.\n\nTwilio probably won't become the next Amazon\n\nTwilio's early mover's advantage gave it a promising start in the cloud communications space, but I'm not convinced it can expand beyond its saturated niche. AWS was able to scale up its operations over the next two decades because it was funded by Amazon's larger e-commerce business, but Twilio needs to grow up on its own. Twilio's business might stabilize over the next few years, but investors looking for the \"next Amazon\" should check out other growing cloud-based companies instead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Twilio right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Twilio, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Twilio wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Monopoly Definition and 11 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 11 near-monopoly stocks in the US. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nA pure monopoly, by definition, refers to a company with no competition whatsoever – a sole provider of a particular product or service. An illustration of this was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which, at one point, stood as the exclusive seller of software and operating systems for computers, leaving consumers with only one option for these products. The connection between monopolies and U.S. consumers is rife with contradictions. Americans harbor suspicions about companies that wield a dominant influence over their industries, closely monitoring how these entities leverage their size and market dominance to maximize profits. Paradoxically, while Americans express concerns about monopolistic power, they readily embrace the advantages associated with economies of scale. Large market leaders are often preferred over small family businesses attempting to compete, fostering an environment that encourages rather than discourages the expansion of market share by substantial corporations.\n\nMonopolies wield significant pricing power, a crucial factor that investor Warren Buffett carefully considers when selecting stocks for his globally tracked portfolio. During his 2011 testimony before the US Congress, Buffett cited pricing power as a vital criterion for evaluating a business. He emphasized that a business with the ability to increase prices without losing market share to competitors exhibits a robust business model.\n\nWhile pure monopolies are rare, some contemporary companies exhibit what can be termed near-monopolies. Benefiting from economies of scale, these corporations establish formidable barriers that discourage new entrants from challenging their dominance. Market leaders like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have penetrated a sector and captured a substantial portion of the market are deemed as some of the best monopoly stocks in that regard. In a bid to expand their market share and revenue, these companies often diversify their product offerings. While they may allows some space for competition, companies like the ones mentioned above boast considerable market power, exerting significant influence over the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn theory, a near-monopoly may not pose a problem, but in practice, such a system may not work in the best interests of consumers unless it is closely monitored. In the absence of competition, monopolies may set excessive prices, offer poor-quality products, and eliminate alternatives to maximize their own profits. While the law doesn't outright prohibit monopolies, various regulations have been implemented to ensure that such companies operate fairly. The Sherman Antitrust Act is a significant piece of legislation used to break up companies that hinder competition and prevent mergers and acquisitions that could lead to a virtual monopoly. While these regulations may limit the profits of monopolies, investors often find these stocks appealing. The substantial market share held by monopolies is likely to contribute to growth and value over time, mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security. Monopoly Definition and 11 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe've identified 11 stocks in the US that exhibit near-monopoly characteristics based on their substantial market share. Several of these companies are part of the FAANG group. The major technology corporations within this list maintain a dominant market presence across various sectors, such as cloud computing, e-commerce, mobile application services, mobile operating systems, search engines, social networking, and web browsers. Additionally, the remaining stocks in the selection assert near-monopoly positions in diverse sectors, including alcoholic beverages, personal credit rating, and satellite radio. The rankings are determined by the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks as of Q3 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 9\n\nPearson plc (NYSE:PSO) is a British multinational publishing and education company with its headquarters in London. Initially established as a construction business in the 1840s, it transitioned to publishing in the 1920s. The company holds the distinction of being the largest publisher of educational materials and textbooks globally.\n\nPearson plc(NYSE:PSO)  generates approximately two-thirds of its revenue and profit from the US market. With a market share exceeding 40%, the company is a dominant force in the fields of assessment, publishing, and online program management in the US. In contrast, the remaining segment of the education publishing and assessment service market is highly fragmented, with numerous smaller players.\n\nAt the end of Q3 2023, 9 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO), a slight increase from the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $15.87 million. Among these hedge funds, 13D Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3 2023.\n\nMuch like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) operates as one of the best monopoly stocks in the US.\n\n10. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), is an American brewing company with its headquarters situated in St. Louis, Missouri. Currently recognized as the world's largest brewing company. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV possesses an array of global brands, including renowned names such as Budweiser, Michelob, Stella Artois, and Beck's.\n\nWhile the company has suffered controversies in the past few months, it continues to hold the distinction of being the largest beer producer globally by volume. In 2022, the company achieved a staggering global production volume of 595 million hectoliters, representing over 25% of the total global beer production. Furthermore, Anheuser-Busch InBev Sa/NV (NYSE:BUD) reported robust financial figures with a revenue of $57.7 billion and a net income approaching $6 billion in 2022.\n\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was one of the largest shareholders in Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) at the end of the third quarter of 2023, holding 1.7 million shares valued at $94.17 million. Overall, 21 hedge funds reported holding stakes in the company as of the end of the quarter.\n\nIn its Q2 2023 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management, a boutique investment firm, commented about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD). Here is what the firm said:\n\n“The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.”\n\n9. Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\n\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI) is a U.S.-based broadcasting corporation with its headquarters located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Specializing in satellite radio and online radio services within the United States, the company holds a monopoly in the satellite radio market.

Mixed second calendar quarter financial results, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue coming in just shy of consensus expectations, coupled with elevated investor concerns about the macro economy and potential weakness in consumer spending later this year, pressured shares. Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On top of these trends in the core business, Apple is thoughtfully investing in new categories like augmented reality, search, financial services, and streaming media content. We took advantage of weakness in the quarter to add to our position in Apple.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nKen Griffin Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates’ Top 15 Dividend Stocks 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure. None.

        "title": "Look Out — iRobot Stock (NASDAQ:IRBT) Will Only Vacuum Your Dollars",
        "content": "Will iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) get acquired soon? If not, then iRobot stock might only vacuum up your investable capital. I am bearish on IRBT stock in the wake of a bombshell news report that could keep the share price down for a long time.\n\nHeadquartered in Massachusetts, iRobot sells robot-type products for home use. The company’s best-known product is the Roomba floor-vacuuming robot. It doesn’t really look like a robot from an old science-fiction movie, but the Roomba is technically a robot, and it’s a fairly popular product.\n\nHowever, as we’ll discover, the Roomba hasn’t been popular enough to give iRobot a profitable profile. Without a famous e-commerce company swooping in to save the day, iRobot’s growth prospects aren’t stellar, and investors should exercise caution.\n\niRobot Stock: The Trend Isn’t Your Friend\n\nI like a good bargain as much as anyone. However, IRBT stock has been in free fall for a while, and dip buyers have gotten burned again and again.\n\nNot to personally insult the iRobot stock chart, but it’s downright ugly. Anyone who bought it above $100 in 2019 or in 2021 lost their shirt, so to speak. This is a textbook example of how chasing stocks higher can be disastrous. Yet, there’s also a lesson here about how bottom-fishing for stocks representing deeply unprofitable businesses can be hazardous to your financial health.\n\nRegarding a stock’s risk-versus-reward profile, it’s typically not a good sign when the stock is halted several times in a single day for extreme volatility. We’ll get to the reasons for this in a moment.\n\nFor now, just consider that iRobot hasn’t had a profitable quarter in a couple of years. In 2023’s third quarter, Wall Street predicted that iRobot would report a loss of $1.67 per share; the actual result was much worse, with a loss of $2.82 per share.\n\nThat same quarter, iRobot generated revenue of $186.176 million. That’s a substantial decline compared to the $278.191 million that iRobot generated in the year-earlier quarter. Thus, there are unfavorable trends happening with iRobot’s financials, as well as with IRBT stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis leads us back to the issues of value and buying the dips in a stock. I certainly don’t recommend buying every stock whenever there’s a blood-in-the-streets situation. Investors should look at a company’s financial health first, and share-price action is of secondary importance. In iRobot’s case, it’s difficult to identify a compelling argument for a dip-buying opportunity based on the company’s financials.\n\nAwful News for iRobot\n\nNow, let’s go back to the report that IRBT stock once got halted for trading multiple times in a single day. That occurred because the European Commission sent Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a statement of objections to the e-commerce giant’s proposed takeover of iRobot.\n\nThis was a disappointing development, to say the least. Prior to that, a report had circulated that the European Union (EU) would approve Amazon’s proposed acquisition of iRobot for $1.4 billion. A relief rally in IRBT stock ensued, but it turned out to be a head-fake.\n\nThe European Commission had antitrust concerns based on the idea that if Amazon owns iRobot, this would restrict competition in the robot vacuum cleaner market. Hence, in a move that undoubtedly surprised iRobot’s optimistic investors, the European Commission released a “statement of objections” to the buyout based on concerns that Amazon would have “the ability and incentive” to prevent competition against iRobot’s Roomba products on Amazon’s e-commerce platform.\n\nSince that time, Amazon hasn’t made a major effort to come to iRobot’s rescue. Notably, Amazon skipped a concessions offer with the European Commission in regard to the proposed iRobot acquisition. Moreover, as of this writing, it appears that Amazon hasn’t officially proposed any remedies to quell the European Commission’s antitrust concerns.\n\nIn other words, Amazon’s lack of recent, decisive action tends to suggest that the company just isn’t all that interested in buying out iRobot. Making matters worse, The Wall Street Journal just reported that the European Commission plans to block Amazon’s proposed buyout of iRobot.\n\nIRBT stock plunged nearly 30% on this bombshell news. Yet, perhaps it’s just the final chapter in a story that was never really meant to happen.\n\nIs IRBT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, IRBT comes in as a Hold based on two Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average iRobot stock price target is $51, implying 191.4% upside potential.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider IRBT Stock?\n\nHow serious is Amazon about buying out iRobot? Maybe Amazon just isn’t so eager that it’s willing to put up a prolonged fight against powerful regulators.\n\nThat’s a problem, along with iRobot’s less-than-ideal financials. So, I wouldn’t be hasty if you’re thinking about going on a rescue buy-the-dip mission with IRBT stock. I’m definitely not considering taking a share position in iRobot, and investors might want to look elsewhere for more favorable opportunities.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Nvidia stock hits all-time high as AI craze rolls on",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stocks hit an all-time high on Friday, as the AI craze continues to roll on in early 2024. Nvidia’s share price jumped more than 2% to $584.87 as of midday. Shares of the AI juggernaut are up some 18% in the first few weeks of the new year and 179% over the last 12 months. And its market cap is quickly approaching $1.5 trillion.\n\nBut Nvidia isn’t the only company benefiting from the AI hype. Rival AMD (AMD) hit an all-time intraday high on Thursday, topping out at $168.60 per share. The chipmaker is up 94% through the last 12 months. Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped 57% over the same period.\n\nNvidia got a huge vote of confidence on Thursday when Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is spending billions of dollars to acquire thousands of Nvidia chips for its AI projects. In an Instagram Reels post, Zuckerberg said Meta will build out AI infrastructure complete with 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 with the goal of developing general artificial intelligence. Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang holds one of the company's new RTX 4090 chips for computer gaming. Sept. 20, 2022. Courtesy of Nvidia Corp/Handout via REUTERS (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nZuckerberg also said he wants to make Meta’s general AI open source, allowing others to use and work with it.\n\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip development, with an estimated market share of between 70% and 90% of the global market. But it’s not just Nvidia’s hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The company’s Cuda software, which developers use to create AI platforms, also serves as a moat that keeps Nvidia above the fray.\n\nThat said, Nvidia’s rivals are gathering with the intent of snatching market share. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its own Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nIt’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Meta, are increasingly turning to chips they develop on their own to power their AI accelerators in the form of what are known as ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits.\n\nStory continues Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThink of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it.\n\nASICs on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. They’re built specifically for a company’s own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\n\nThat’s a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as ASICs start to take hold, they may have less of a need for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nStill, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. In other words, there’s still plenty of room to grow. Even if Nvidia’s market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.\n\nFor now, though, Nvidia remains the AI king.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Amazon's (AMZN) proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of iRobot Corporation (IRBT) is likely to be blocked by EU antitrust regulators, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Though no final decision has been made yet, concerns are mounting that the deal would unfairly eliminate competition in the robot vacuum market.\n\niRobot is the maker of the popular Roomba autonomous home vacuums, while Amazon has its own brand of Alexa-enabled cleaning robots. Combining the Roomba maker with Amazon, which dominates e-commerce, raises red flags for regulators who are concerned about stifling consumer choices.\n\nYahoo Fiance's Alexis Keenan breaks down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Well, shares of iRobot, the company behind Roomba vacuum cleaners, plummeting this morning on reports that a European Union's antitrust regulators reportedly planning to block Amazon's $1.4 billion buyout of the company. This marks yet another potential big tech acquisition being blocked as governments globally put up roadblocks. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan who's digging into this story for us. And Alexis, of course here, that's a story over in Europe. But here in the US, we saw that big merger being blocked between JetBlue and Spirit this week.\n\nALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, a lot of activity in the antitrust space, Akiko. And this one-time $1.4 billion deal now reportedly, according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" is likely to be rejected by the European Commission. Those are the regulators over in Europe that deal with antitrust. Now Amazon's acquisition of the vacuum maker, iRobot, came under concern across the pond as well as over here by the FTC, concern that it would kill competition in the robot vacuum market, if you will.\n\nThe commission has yet to make, a decision a final decision here. But what \"The Wall Street Journal\" is saying is that it is likely. Now that could really kill this deal altogether wherever it is, whether in Europe or in the US. But this pushback is really important kind of on a larger scale here. With putting this into context, it's really part of a multinational, multi-agency push to foreclose on these very high-profile mergers and acquisitions and also anti-competitive conduct at large.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, in the US, as I mentioned earlier, the FTC has its own reported investigation into the iRobot deal, still investigating. We don't know what is going to happen with the FTC's inquiry at this point. But the FTC has already filed against Amazon recently in September bringing a suit against the company on conduct grounds, saying that its Amazon Prime business is operating in an anti-competitive way. Now if we look beyond Amazon, though, there's also a number of cases that are big tech antitrust cases in addition to those-- the airline one that you just mentioned.\n\nNow you have the Department of Justice's case that's still pending conclusion. It went to trial in 2023 against Google, saying that the company is abusing its monopoly in the online ad market. You also have the FTC's case that didn't have success for the FTC against Microsoft trying to block its acquisition last year of Activision Blizzard. And also, those are just a few. There are others. You have states and the DOJ also with separate actions against Google in its search business.\n\nBut guys, this iRobot deal frustrating, probably for the company here. The company's been in decline for a couple of years. This putting the stock under further pressure. The company is expected to report its full-year results for 2023 in February and expected to be down a roughly $7 a share on the year, guys.\n\n- And so as we're looking at this push that we're continuing to see, obviously not just in the US, but also in Europe and other countries as well, what does this mean for the landscape for investors as they're watching regulators striking down these deals? And investors really trying to make sense of why.\n\nALEXIS KEENAN: Yeah, so going back to some of those cases that we were just showing you on the screen there, there's just a push whether it's in the European Union, in the US to go after whether it's antitrust alleged violations on the conduct side, saying that there's a monopoly that's operating in ways that it shouldn't, that's foreclosing on competition, or just killing these mergers these acquisitions all together, certainly earlier this week with the JetBlue Spirit attempted merger that won a court deciding to side with the DOJ and say that that would be problematic for customers in searching for favorable airline fares.\n\nThat's a big one here. But the Biden administration back in 2021 put out an executive order saying that the DOJ, that the FTC, and other regulators in the US should really be rethinking antitrust in the way that the guidelines are written. There has been a draft that has gone out proposing some changes. But look, there is definitely a push here, and we're seeing, I think-- Although there's been a decline in the number of cases filed by the DOJ and FTC since 2020, since President Trump's last year in office, we are seeing this high-profile push and the administration going after these major, major US companies.",

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is continuously making solid efforts to bolster its presence in the cloud computing space of the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) region.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from Amazon Web Services’ (“AWS”) latest investment plans in Japan. The company intends to pump in 2.26 trillion yen ($15.24 billion) in Japan by 2027.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, AWS strives to boost its cloud infrastructure across the country, especially in Tokyo and Osaka.\r\n\r\nThe latest move is likely to aid AWS in catering well to the growing demand for artificial intelligence services in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe underlined investment plan comes on top of AWS’ spending of 1.51 trillion yen in the country throughout 2011-2022.\r\n\r\nAWS’ growing investments in Japan are expected to bolster its presence in the booming public cloud market of the country, which, per a report from Statista, is expected to generate $21.44 billion in revenues in 2024. The figure is expected to reach $34.1 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 12.3% between 2024 and 2028.\n\nGrowth Prospects in APAC\n\nApart from the latest Japan expansion plans, AWS plans to launch an infrastructure region in Malaysia, in which it strives to invest around $6 billion by 2037 and support job creation in the country.\r\n\r\nThe company’s launch of its second infrastructure region in Melbourne, Australia, last year remains a plus. Through the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) region, AWS strives to invest around $4.5 billion by 2037 and support 2,500 full-time jobs annually.\r\n\r\nAlso, the launch of an infrastructure region in Israel, located in Tel Aviv, namely, AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region, is another positive.\r\n\r\nAWS has plans to open a region in Bangkok, Thailand. It also intends to set up an infrastructure region in Auckland, New Zealand, comprising three availability zones.\r\n\r\nAll these endeavors are expected to aid Amazon, which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, to capitalize on the growth prospects present in the APAC region, which is an emerging market for cloud technology and has been under the spotlight for the past few years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nPer a Research and Markets report, the cloud market in the APAC region is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.1% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service are gaining strong momentum in APAC.\r\n\r\nSeveral companies in APAC have already migrated workloads to the cloud and many are in the process of migration. The firms are highly focused on the development of digital transformation solutions through the cloud to cater to increasing customer demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nGiven the booming scenario in APAC, not only Amazon but also its peers like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Alibaba BABA are leaving no stone unturned to expand their presence in the region.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Azure is gearing up for the opening of five data centers in APAC, namely South Central India, Indonesia Central, Malaysia West, New Zealand North and Taiwan North, which will be located in Hyderabad, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Auckland and Taipei, respectively.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure also has plans to launch a Saudi Arabia Central region.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alphabet’s Google launched a data center in Japan in 2023, marking its third such establishment in Asia. The facility is located in Inzai, Chiba. Google’s opening of a data center in Singapore is also noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s opening of cloud regions in India’s New Delhi and Australia’s Melbourne last year is an uptrend. Further, the search giant’s opening of the new region located in Doha, Qatar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia, is another positive.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is hugely investing in expanding its presence in the cloud market of the underlined region. The launch of Alibaba Cloud’s third data center in Indonesia remains noteworthy.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Jeff Bezos Held 60 Meetings To Secure Amazon Investors But 38 Declined His Offer Of $50,000 For 1% Ownership — A Decision That Could Have Made Them Over $15 Billion Today",
        "content": "Taking a chance on something unknown is always intimidating. It's easy to pass up an opportunity, especially when its success seems uncertain. But what if that opportunity was Amazon?\n\nIn 1994, Jeff Bezos, a then 30-year-old hedge fund manager, was seeking funding for a revolutionary idea: an online bookshop. To realize this vision, Bezos embarked on a quest to secure investments of approximately $50,000 each from potential investors, primarily targeting family members, friends and others who might be willing to take a risk on his concept.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban’s startup investment strategyaccording to his colorful portfolio. Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.\n\nBezos's journey to raise funds for his nascent company was no small feat. He held 60 meetings, tirelessly pitching his idea to convince others of its potential. Despite his efforts, he faced numerous rejections. Out of the 60 people he approached, only 22 were convinced to invest in his idea, contributing to the $1 million he needed to start Amazon.com Inc. In total, he gave up 20% to early investors, according to a 2013 article on Geekwire.\n\nThe 22 people who leaped included Bezos's parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, as well as his younger brother Mark and sister Christina. Bezos's parents emerged as major winners after investing $300,000 for a 6% stake in the company.\n\nA 2016 Business Insider article highlighted that a $50,000 investment in Amazon at the early stages for a 1% stake in the company would have been worth approximately $3.5 billion that year, provided those stakes had never been diluted by later investors.\n\nTrending: Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and that same investment would now be valued at approximately $15.9 billion based on Amazon's January market capitalization of approximately $1.59 trillion to $1.604 trillion. This figure showcases Amazon's growth and success that potentially transformed early backers into billionaires. It’s unknown whether these investors retained their entire stakes; this estimate merely calculates the potential growth of the original investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of those who declined to invest in Amazon still find it too painful to discuss their decision, knowing they missed out on becoming billionaires. Meanwhile, others recognize that they have led fulfilling lives regardless of the missed opportunity. As Bezos reflected in an on-stage interview posted by The Guardian in 2018, \"Some people are just better at rolling with the punches.\"\n\nIn 1994, the internet was far from mainstream, and many were skeptical about its potential. This skepticism was reflected in the reactions of potential investors. As Bezos recalled, \"The first question people had, was what was the internet?\" He noted that anyone with knowledge of the book business did not invest, illustrating the challenge of convincing people to invest in an unfamiliar and unproven concept.\n\nThe early investment rounds of Amazon are a prime example of the potential rewards of investing in startups. They underscore the significance of vision and the willingness to take risks in the entrepreneurial world. Bezos’s ability to recognize the possibilities of the internet and e-commerce and to convince a select group of investors to support his vision was crucial in Amazon’s journey from a tiny startup to one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHedge funds intend to snatch all pre-IPO shares of future AI unicorns before you can.

        "content": "With inaugural grant cycle underway, MSD Solutions Lab initiative launches 2024 programs to continue advancing musculoskeletal disorder research and innovation\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Following the debut of the Research to Solutions (R2S) grant and MSD Solutions Pilot Grant in 2023, the National Safety Council is awarding up to an additional $260,000 this year through these pioneering grant programs to help uncover promising new safety solutions to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders, or MSDs. As a key initiative of the Council's MSD Solutions Lab, a groundbreaking strategic program established in 2021 with funding from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), a total of up to $535,000 has now been committed in grants to foster innovative, transferable methods to mitigate MSDs – the most common workplace injury – across a range of sectors and workplaces.  The National Safety Council is dedicated to eliminating the leading causes of preventable death and injury focusing our efforts on the workplace, roadway and impairment. (PRNewsfoto/National Safety Council)\n\n\"Bringing together the brightest minds and pushing the boundaries of MSD prevention research and technology is at the heart of all we do,\" said Paul Vincent, NSC executive vice president of workplace practice. \"We're proud to bring back these grants for another year so we can expand our network of top innovators to solve this pervasive safety challenge, and ultimately help workers lead safer, healthier lives on and off the job.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to continue our partnership with NSC on the MSD Solutions Lab,\" said Sarah Rhoads, Vice President of Global Workplace Health and Safety at Amazon. \"The Research to Solutions and MSD Pilot Grant programs will advance research and create scalable MSD mitigation programs that help improve safety for employees on a global scale.\"\n\nMSDs include tendinitis, back strains and sprains, as well as carpal tunnel syndrome, and are often caused by exposures to repetitive, forceful exertions like heavy lifting. They affect people in every industry and sector, and cost U.S. businesses in the private sector nearly $17 billion a year, according to the Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index. Recognizing the scope of these injuries, each grant is designed to further MSD prevention:\n\nStory continues\n\nResearch to Solutions, which will award up to $50,000 per approved research project, for a total of $200,000 in grants, invites academic institutions, businesses and industries to innovate new solutions for MSDs, focusing on occupational injury risk reduction that can be seamlessly integrated across a range of sectors and workplaces. R2S proposals should support one or more key research areas, including emerging technologies, solutions to jobs or tasks known to have high MSD risk, MSD management systems, and total worker wellbeing. MSD Pilot Grant, which will award up to $20,000 per approved project, for a total of $60,000 in grants, aims to reduce MSDs caused by upper-extremity work by matching organizations with innovative technology providers to trial emerging technologies in real-life applications. This grant is available to members of the MSD Pledge community willing to partner with the six leading technology providers featured at the 2023 NSC Safety Congress & Expo.\n\nNSC will announce the list of this year's grant recipients in May 2024 and the winners will have an opportunity to present their safety findings at the 2025 NSC Safety Congress & Expo or another event. For the current 2023-2024 grant cycle, the inaugural recipients will share their key learnings and research at this year's NSC Safety Congress & Expo in Orlando, Florida from September 16-18. Winners also shared progress reports with the MSD Solutions Lab before the end of 2023.\n\nThe R2S and MSDs Pilot Grant are two of several initiatives supported by the MSD Solutions Lab to achieve its goal of preventing MSDs.

        "title": "Amazon’s $1.4 Billion iRobot Deal to Be Blocked by EU Antitrust Watchdog",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot Corp. is expected to be blocked by the European Union’s antitrust regulator over concerns that the deal will harm other robot vacuum makers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union S&P 500 Hits All-Time High in Historic Bull Run: Markets Wrap Ford Cuts Workforce Making Electric F-150s on Weak Demand YouTube and Spotify Won’t Launch Apple Vision Pro Apps, Joining Netflix China’s $6.3 Trillion Stock Selloff Is Getting Uglier by the Day\n\nThe e-commerce giant was told the deal was likely to be rejected at a meeting Thursday with officials from the European Commission, according to people familiar with the matter. A final decision still needs formal approval from the EU’s political leadership and is due by Feb. 14.\n\nAmazon declined to comment. Shares in Bedford, Massachusetts-based iRobot sank as much as 31% to $16.30 on Friday widening the deal spread to more than $35, the widest level since the merger announced more than a year ago.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the expected decision from the meeting.\n\nThe deal is likely to face opposition in the US as well. According to people familiar with the matter, the Federal Trade Commission has been drafting a lawsuit that would seek to block the acquisition. The FTC’s three commissioners haven’t yet voted on a challenge nor had a final meeting with Amazon to discuss the potential case, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing an ongoing probe.\n\nIt was widely expected that the EU commission would oppose the deal after it expressed concerns last month that Amazon might be tempted to use its dominant position as an online retailer to favor iRobot products over those of competitors. EU interim competition chief Didier Reynders said Amazon had to pledge fair treatment to all robot vacuums offered on its platform.\n\nAmazon declined to make concessions to allay the EU’s concerns. Instead, the e-commerce firm is already prepping a legal challenge to the commission’s decision, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt would be the second major tech merger blocked in recent months by the EU regulator, which nixed Booking Holdings Inc.’s €1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) bid for Sweden’s Etraveli Group in September. Booking is appealing that decision.\n\nThe EU’s opposition to its iRobot acquisition highlights the tension between Amazon’s retail operations and its ambitions for the smart-home ecosystem built around its Alexa voice assistant. The FTC has also expressed concern that the deal would give Amazon too much control over the smart-home device market and potentially violate users’ privacy by giving the company access to data on their homes.\n\nAnalysts say the EU’s decision is a relatively minor setback for Amazon, which has the resources to pursue alternatives to the deal. “Amazon can continue to pursue a home connectivity strategy, even without iRobot,” Gil Lauria of D.A. Davidson & Co. said in an interview, adding, “This is a very small deal for a very large company.”\n\nThe stakes for iRobot are potentially greater. The company, which pioneered robot vacuums, has seen demand for its products fall by nearly half since a 2021 pandemic peak in the face of growing competition from lower-priced manufacturers. Shares in the company have been falling for months on fears that the deal would be blocked. Last year, it was forced to secure a $200 million financing facility, and Amazon cut its per-share offer by about 15%.\n\nThe EU’s decision again puts it at odds with the UK’s antitrust watchdog, which gave the deal the green light after finding it would have limited competitive impact on the British market. The UK Competition and Markets Authority also split with its European counterpart by approving the Booking deal and, at least initially, blocking Microsoft Corp.’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc. The CMA later reversed its position on the Microsoft-Activision deal.\n\nWhen Amazon announced its intention to buy iRobot in 2022, the acquisition was seen as a way for the e-commerce giant to expand its presence in the burgeoning market for smart-home gadgets. Besides baking its Alexa voice assistant into multiple devices, the company has fielded a personal robot named Astro.\n\nEarly in its development, Astro struggled to map and navigate homes with complicated or unusual layouts, something iRobot has been working on for years with Roombas. Astro remains available only to invited buyers more than two years after its introduction, and Amazon now plans to sell a security guard version to businesses, Bloomberg reported in November.\n\nThough small for a company the size of Amazon, an iRobot acquisition would be the fourth-biggest in its history, trailing only its purchases of Whole Foods Market, movie studio MGM and the One Medical concierge healthcare service.\n\nMore broadly, Luria said the deal-making climate for Big Tech has soured. “It’s hard for large technology companies to acquire anything right now. And it’s likely to become harder. There’s a global – or let’s say at least a trans-Atlantic – alliance around preventing technology companies from expanding through acquisition, and thus limiting competition.”\n\n--With assistance from Alexandra Muller and Matt Day.\n\n(Updates with shares on market open and deal spread in the third paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "title": "iRobot stock plunges on report EU will block Amazon deal",
        "content": "Shares of iRobot (IRBT) sank in early trading on Friday. The Wall Street Journal reported that a European Union regulator will block Amazon's (AMZN) $1.4 billion bid to buy the Roomba maker, sending the stock sharply lower. Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith and Seana Smith break down what could lie ahead for the deal.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: A trending ticker we're watching this morning, iRobot, plunging after the EU reportedly intends to block Amazon's $1.4 billion bid to buy the company according to the \"Wall Street Journal.\" The rejection would still need formal approval before a final decision. There you're taking a look premarket at shares of iRobot down 31% as of right now.\n\nLarger question is, was Amazon and are they going to be willing to go back and try to put forward these concessions? They already missed the deadline unclear as to whether or not there will be some leeway here with the EU regulators there.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. There's lots of question there. And, obviously, we're seeing the reaction play out in shares this morning. iRobot, one of the top trending stickers-- tickers on our \"Yahoo Finance\" site. But moving this forward beyond the EU, of course, then the focus comes to the FTC. The focus comes to US regulators. There are reports here that it is expected that US regulators are going to push back against this deal, citing antitrust concerns. They are preparing Amazon for a legal challenge here in the EU. They did decline in terms of making any sort of concessions that the EU had been pushing for. And the EU regulators have been pushing for Amazon to pledge fair treatment to all robot vacuums that were offered on their platform.\n\nSo pushing back on that, they're now preparing for a legal challenge. But, again, this then, when we look ahead, we turn our focus to the US, to regulation here. We know, obviously, there has been a crackdown under the Biden administration pushing back on some of these types of deals in terms of antitrust concerns, in terms of this monopoly concern, whether or not there's going to be fair competition throughout this space.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo once you see some of the pressure from overseas, from EU antitrust regulators planning to reject this $1.4 billion bid for iRobot, then you have to think to yourself, there's a good chance that maybe US regulators are going to take a similar view.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah. And the EU has been more stringent on Amazon. If you think back to some of the other settlements that Amazon and the EU have had to reach in the past over anti-competitive practices, this is just another point in the chronological order that we've seen for the EU-Amazon tussle.\n\nSEANA SMITH: It is. We will see once we get that official decision. Again, just a report here from the Journal.",

        "content": "Gen Z consists of individuals born between 1997 and 2012. Many articles have depicted this group’s potential to pursue new trends and lifestyles, similar to how many articles have emerged about Generation Alpha.\n\nHowever, many people in Gen Z are reaching the point where they can spend their own money. The youngest people in this cohort are 12 years old, and as they age, they will have an outsized impact on the economy.\n\nIt’s similar to how millennials have risen to prominence. That age cohort is filled with people who are 28-43 years old. Most people in this cohort have jobs, while Gen Z is creeping up to that stage.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs members of Gen Z make more money, they will use it to buy products and services that align with their interests and values. These seven stocks are already benefitting from the Gen Z goldmine.\n\nLululemon (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) is an athletic apparel retailer with 686 stores. The company’s products have been a big hit among Gen Z, especially in international markets.\n\nRevenue increased by 19% year-over-year in the third quarter to $2.2 billion. International sales growth reached 49% year-over-year and can drive elevated revenue growth for several years.\n\nLULU stock has gained 54% over the past year and is up 219% over the past five years. High spending from Gen Z can keep this going, and Lululemon has also been winning support from other generations.\n\nLululemon continues to gain market share in the industry and trades at a 34-forward P/E ratio. The company has a market cap of just above $60 billion. Calvin McDonald, CEO of Lululemon, shared sentiments in the Q3 press release that indicate more gains are on the horizon.\n\n“As we enter the holiday season, we are pleased with our early performance and are well-positioned to deliver for our guests in the fourth quarter,” he stated.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.\n\nSource: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) is a video game and entertainment juggernaut that has become a nostalgic brand for many consumers. Rumors about a Nintendo Switch 2 coming out in 2024 can drum up more sales for the company, especially if it’s as successful as the original Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe company has produced many recognizable brands such as Super Mario Bros, Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, and many others. Nintendo also has many large brands under its umbrella that aren’t as relevant in pop culture but still generate profits for the company.\n\nWhile investors should get excited about the prospects of a new Nintendo Switch, I am more excited about a larger presence in movie theaters. The Super Mario Bros Movie exceeded $1 billion in revenue, and a sequel is in the works.\n\nNintendo has a treasure trove of content where they can simply retell the stories and profit considerably for their shareholders. The declining quality of Marvel movies has left a void that Nintendo can pounce on.\n\nWith excitement building for the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie, it’s easy to see the company cover more ground. If the company wants to go in that direction, Nintendo even has a path to bring the characters together in a cinematic universe via a Super Smash Bros movie. It’s exciting to think of the movies Nintendo can produce as an investor and a fan.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) offers beauty and cosmetics products that tap into Gen Z’s social consciousness. The company does not use ingredients involved with animal cruelty. While other beauty products have these questionable ingredients, Gen Z gets to look and feel good without worrying as much about how the beauty products get made.\n\nThe stock is small and growing fast. The company’s market cap is at roughly $8.75 billion, thanks to a strong rally over the past five years. Shares are up by approximately 1,800% during that stretch. Elf Beauty didn’t slow down and gained 218% over the past year.\n\nThe company’s exceptional financials can support the significant gains and the stock’s 50-forward P/E ratio. The company achieved 76.1% year-over-year revenue growth while exceeding analysts’ expectations.\n\nElf Beauty is already off to a strong start in 2024. While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have traded sideways to start the year, Elf Beauty has gained 12% year-to-date. The company has a good chance of continuing its trend of beating the market.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome companies stick around for multiple generations, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is no exception to that rule. People will always need search engines, and companies will always run advertisements to get in front of more people.\n\nGoogle has become the search engine of choice for many people to the point where people use “Google” as a verb. Similarly, YouTube has become the go-to platform for people who want to watch videos. The company was beloved as a member of FAANG and has remained a fan-favorite as part of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAlphabet has also expanded into cloud computing, which has proven fruitful for the company. Google Cloud revenue reached $8.4 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Consumers and businesses need cloud computing to keep their information safe and increase efficiency.\n\nAlphabet will continue to thrive as Gen Z gets older. With so much capital coming its way every quarter, Alphabet can reinvest into its “Other Bets,” which can generate more growth in the future.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also has cloud computing through Amazon Web Services. It’s a useful resource for consumers and businesses, but the company has several components that Gen Z loves.\n\nAmazon makes shopping online easier than leaving your home to buy a product. Gen Z loves convenience, and Amazon delivers on that front. The company also offers streaming and releases numerous movies each year. While streaming isn’t the core component of Amazon’s business, it gives Gen Z another reason to stay loyal to the brand.\n\nAmazon also owns Twitch, a popular video game streaming platform. Younger generations enjoy playing video games and often go to Twitch to see eSports players, casual gamers, and everyone in between.\n\nThe tech giant has several business segments wrapped into one enterprise that attract Gen Z and give that generation several reasons to stick around. Just like Alphabet, Amazon is positioned to serve multiple generations and remain in business for well over 100 years.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a high-growth fast food restaurant that offers healthier food than many other fast food restaurants. While companies like McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) offer cheap, unhealthy food, Chipotle offers healthier foods relative to its competition.\n\nGen Z tends to be more health-conscious than previous generations, which bodes well for Chipotle. While healthier foods are available, especially if you cook your own food, Chipotle offers the convenience of a fast food restaurant without the type of guilt that comes from eating at an unhealthy fast food restaurant.\n\nInvestors noticed and have continued to bid up the stock price over several years. The company’s long-term returns are spicier than its food. Shares have gained 344% over the past five years and are up by 50% over the past year.\n\nChipotle continues gaining market share, which should expand as Gen Z ages. The company reported 11.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023 and opened 62 new restaurants. 54 of those restaurants have a Chipotlane, a new option that has performed well for the company.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the first six companies are recognizable brands for Gen Z, not as many people know about Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), the cybersecurity leader operates behind the scenes to keep people’s information safe from hackers.\n\nMost of Gen Z has online accounts on various websites. Each of those online accounts is a vulnerability point a hacker can use to access sensitive information. Small businesses and large corporations invest in cybersecurity to keep their customers safe.\n\nCompanies like Palo Alto Networks benefit as more people go online. New people joining the web and creating accounts on different platforms means more data to protect.\n\nThis opportunity hasn’t been a secret for investors. PANW stock has gained 377% over the past five years and is up 136% over the past year. The company is up 10% year-to-date, while most indices have been flat to start the year.\n\nThe company’s financials give investors more reasons to feel confident. The company reported 20% year-over-year revenue growth to start fiscal 2024, and a high order backlog suggests the growth will continue. Palo Alto Networks is a profitable company that experienced an 871% year-over-year growth in net income in the most recent quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in ELF.

        "title": "Hey, Pal! Don’t Even THINK About Investing in PYPL Stock.",
        "content": "The payments-processing space has become increasingly crowded in the 2020s. Along with that, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has the additional challenge of transitioning a new CEO and a new chief financial officer (CFO) into those roles at the company. Thus, I view PYPL stock as a “sell” as PayPal’s comeback is far from assured. And, if it happens at all, might take a very long time.\n\nMaking matters worse, PayPal just got downgraded by an analyst who issued an important warning for prospective investors. So, we’ll definitely address the major problems that should convince prudent traders to avoid PayPal stock.\n\nPayPal’s ‘Generational Problem’\n\nIt’s always interesting when a bullish analyst gives us a bearish idea. In particular, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev is generally bullish on PYPL stock, but he recently acknowledged that PayPal “has a generational problem.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe next time you see a PayPal button on the checkout page of an online store, consider this. PayPal’s global share of the U.S. payments market (according to Barron’s) is just 8%. And remember, the PayPal brand has to compete with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has almost universal name recognition among young consumers.\n\nSure, PayPal also owns the Venmo brand. But then, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is dropping Venmo as a payment processing option at checkout. These are issues that eager PayPal stock investors ought to consider. PayPal will have to overcome its brand’s “generational problem” and somehow take market share from Apple Pay and other rival brands. That’s much easier said than done.\n\nAre PYPL Stock Investors Willing to Wait Years for a Turnaround?\n\nThe company might actually stage a turnaround at some point. It’s a gamble to bet on this happening, though. Besides, even if there’s an eventual comeback for PayPal, the share price could stagnate for a while.\n\nBTIG analysts Andrew Harte and Thomas Smith are evidently trying to warn prospective investors about this. “We see the process of returning the company to consistent and profitable revenue growth as a multiyear initiative, rather than a FY24 story,” they wrote about PayPal. That’s a bitter pill to swallow if you own PYPL stock and hoped to enjoy robust returns this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts with Oppenheimer reinforced the BTIG analysts’ warning about PayPal’s long-term challenges. They stated, “The issue at hand is the duration of time before PYPL can stabilize operating margins without cutting expenses year over year.” Then they added, “This duration is likely counted in years.”\n\nWith that in mind, the BTIG analysts downgraded PayPal stock from “buy” to “neutral.” Meanwhile, the Oppenheimer analysts lowered their rating on PayPal shares from “outperform” to “perform.” So clearly, there are Wall Street experts out there who aren’t particularly enthusiastic about PayPal’s near-term prospects.\n\nMinimize Your Exposure to PayPal Stock\n\nYou don’t need to panic-sell PayPal stock right now. The idea here is just to consider the potentially lengthy time frame for PayPal’s turnaround.\n\nBearing that in mind, investors might choose to minimize their exposure to PYPL stock. It will take at least a few more quarters to see what PayPal’s new CEO and CFO can really do. Therefore, unless some highly positive catalysts emerge soon, I’m not prepared to confidently recommend an investment in PayPal.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

        "title": "3 Top-Rated Growth Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are Loving Now: January 2024",
        "content": "Some investors want to beat the market instead of accumulating shares of an index fund. These investors often prioritize top-rated growth stocks that show compelling financials and tremendous potential.\n\nWhile it’s possible to find these stocks with your own research and a reliable screener, investors can also take a cue from Wall Street analysts. Not every Wall Street analyst outperforms the market, but their research and commentary around their price targets can empower retail investors. Wall Street has shown favor in the past to many current top-rated growth stocks, including these three standouts.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWall Street often sticks with its favorites, especially if those picks continue to perform well. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) fits that description and is present in many mutual funds and ETFs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet makes most of its revenue from advertising placements on Google and YouTube. However, the company has diversified into cloud computing and other bets. Those business segments can accelerate revenue growth, but Alphabet’s ad business remains reliable.\n\nThe firm recently laid off workers in a move that Wall Street views as an effective cost-cutting measure. The move can increase Alphabet’s profitability and reward investors.\n\nAlphabet’s stock has performed well for many years. Shares are up by 54% over the past year and have gained 165% over the past five years. Despite approaching a $2 trillion market cap, Alphabet continues to grow.\n\nThe company posted 11% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. Net income increased by 41.6% year-over-year.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a universally beloved stock among Wall Street analysts. 42 analysts rated the e-commerce tech giant as a “buy” with zero hold or sell ratings. The average price target implies close to 20% upside with $220 per share as the highest price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon continues to grow despite being a large company valued at $1.6 trillion. The company reported 13% year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter of 2023. Net income reached $9.9 billion which was a big improvement from the $2.2 billion net income during the same period last year.\n\nAmazon has experienced a resurgence with a 63% gain over the past year. The stock currently trades at a 40-forward P/E ratio. Growth in advertising and cloud computing can lead the stock to further gains.\n\nJust like Alphabet, Amazon has been laying off workers in multiple divisions. Wall Street interprets this development as an opportunity for Amazon to increase profits and put more capital into high-growth areas.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a sports beverage brand that more than doubled its revenue and earnings in 2023. The company has been achieving that high growth rate for quite some time, resulting in a 4,775% stock gain over the past five years.\n\nDespite the stock’s success, the firm only has a $14 billion market cap. The company has more opportunities to explore, including international markets. Celsius Holdings is in its very early innings with international expansion. The overwhelming majority of its revenue comes from North America.\n\nThe sports drink is a healthier alternative to other beverages in the market. Celsius Holdings isn’t the first brand to take off because it offers a healthier alternative to a common food or drink. For instance, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has rewarded investors for several years because it’s a healthier alternative to other fast food joints.\n\nInvestors see the trend taking shape again and project CELH to gain more than 20% from its current price. 12 out of 14 analysts rated the stock as a “buy” while the remaining two analysts rated it as a “hold.”\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in CELH. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMarc Guberti is a finance freelance writer at InvestorPlace.com who hosts the Breakthrough Success Podcast. He has contributed to several publications, including the U.S. News & World Report, Benzinga, and Joy Wallet.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "WPP’s (NYSE:WPP) GroupM has predicted that U.S. digital ad revenue will grow by an impressive 9.4% this year. I believe that that growth estimate is conservative, given the economy’s resilience. Reduced concerns about a recession, lower inflation and overall greater confidence in the economy will also factor in. Accordingly, growing user bases and robust revenue growth make digital ad stocks attractive to advertisers and consumers. Consequently, these stocks are most likely to get a boost from the digital ad rebound.\n\nRoku (ROKU) Logo for Roku, Inc. (ROKU) displayed on a glass building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) obtains the lion’s share of its revenue from connected TV ads, and the connected TV ad market is thriving. Specifically, the sector’s revenue is expected to soar 22% this year to $30.1 billion.\n\nGiven Roku ‘s status as a leader in the connected TV ad market, its revenue unsurprisingly jumped 20% YOY. Moreover, its user base climbed 16%, while its streaming hours soared 50% YOY.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoku obtains a significant amount of its ad revenue from companies promoting their own streaming channels. Therefore, the continuation of the “streaming wars” should boost the company’s top and bottom lines this year.\n\nIn light of nearly 50% of American household’s with broadband internet now using Roku’s system, the company should get a boost from political ads as the presidential election looms closer.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) etsy logo on a grey wall\n\nSource: quietbits / Shutterstock.com\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) allows individual artists to sell their products online.\n\nLast month, investment bank B. Riley started coverage of the stock with a “Buy” rating and a $100 price target, nearly 50% above the name’s current levels. The bank says that the number of active buyers who are continuing to use the site is growing, which will benefit Etsy’s ad business.\n\nIn its Q3 press release, Etsy wrote that “Solid revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in Etsy Ads, payments revenue and transaction fee revenue from Offsite Ads.” As digital ad revenue climbs, it’s a good bet that Etsy will deliver strong top-and-bottom-line growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nIn 2024, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) will continue to get a significant lift from its strong ad demand and its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe deal with Amazon to have the e-commerce giant advertising on Pinterest kicked off in Q2 2023. Wells Fargo estimated that the deal would boost Pinterest’s top line by $360 million in the U.S. and Canada. Accordingly, as advertising tends to have very high margins, most of the revenue from the deal will to flow to Pinterest’s bottom line.\n\nThe company’s top line and user base climbed 6.4% and 8% year-over-year, respectively.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com — Here is your Pro Recap of 4 head-turning deal dispatches you may have missed this week: iRobot plummets on report EU is set to block Amazon deal, Spirit Airlines/JetBlue deal blocked by judge, Synopsys to buy Ansys, and Sekisui House to acquire MDC Holdings.\n\nLooking to build a market-betting portfolio for 2024? Join InvestingPro now and access the AI-powered strategy that outperformed the market by 670% over the last decade.\n\niRobot Tesla plummets on report EU is set to block Amazon deal\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) shares plummeted nearly 36% pre-market today following a report by the Wall Street Journal, which indicated that the EU regulators are likely to block Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) planned acquisition of the company.\n\niRobot shares have declined more than 60% since the start of the month.\n\nLast week, it was reported that Amazon had not proposed any solutions to the concerns raised by the EU antitrust regulators regarding its proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of iRobot. The companies had a deadline of Jan 10 to make an offer to tackle European Union objections.\n\nBack in November, the European Commission's competition authorities had issued a preliminary warning to Amazon. They indicated that the acquisition might limit competition in the robot vacuum cleaner sector, signaling their expectation for Amazon to offer solutions to address these concerns.\n\nSpirit Airlines shares plunge as JetBlue deal blocked by judge\n\nShares of Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) experienced a sharp decline of over 47% on Tuesday. This significant drop followed a decision by a federal judge to block JetBlue Airways' (NASDAQ:JBLU) proposed $3.8B acquisition of its low-cost rival. The judge ruled that the merger would significantly reduce competition in the industry.\n\n\"JetBlue plans to convert Spirit's planes to the JetBlue layout and charge JetBlue's higher average fares to its customers,\" said U.S. District Court Judge William Young in his decision. \"The elimination of Spirit would harm cost-conscious travelers who rely on Spirit's low fares.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSynopsys to buy Ansys in $35B deal\n\nShares of ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) dropped over 5% on Tuesday following the announcement that the company has to be acquired by Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) for approximately $35B in cash and stock.\n\nAccording to the acquisition terms, shareholders of Ansys will receive $197 in cash and 0.3450 shares of Synopsys for each share of Ansys they hold. This valuation is based on Synopsys' closing price as of December 21, 2023, bringing the enterprise value to around $35B.\n\nThe transaction is anticipated to be closed in the first half of 2025.\n\nJapan's homebuilder Sekisui House to acquire MDC Holdings for $4.9B\n\nJapanese house manufacturer Sekisui House (OTC:SKHSY) and U.S. homebuilder MDC Holdings (NYSE:MDC) announced an agreement for the former to buy the latter in an all-cash transaction. MDC stock surged more than 18% yesterday following the news.\n\nThe deal, valued at approximately $4.9B, is set to strengthen Sekisui House's presence in the U.S. housing market, the press release said.\n\nTake your investing game to the next level in 2024 with ProPicks\n\nInstitutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.\n\nNow, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.\n\nWith our six strategies, including the flagship \"Tech Titans,\" which outperformed the market by a lofty 952% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.\n\nSubscribe here for up to 50% off as part of our year-end sale and never miss a bull market again!\n\nRelated Articles\n\niRobot plummets on report EU is set to block Amazon deal: 4 big deal reports\n\nABB's China operations under investigation by US Congress\n\nS&P revises Ecopetrol outlook to negative",

        "title": "Why iRobot Stock Dropped Today",
        "content": "Shares of iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT) fell 14.2% on Thursday as investors speculated over the implications of an upcoming meeting of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) pending acquisition of the home-robotics specialist. After the regular session closed, however, iRobot stock plummeted another 40% in after-hours trading following a separate report that European regulators are planning to block the deal.\n\nAmazon's bluff seems to have backfired\n\nRecall that iRobot stock also fell last week amid reports that Amazon had opted not to offer concessions to European Union (E.U.) antitrust regulators as it works to clear its impending purchase of the Roomba maker. The move sparked speculation over whether Amazon was content to allow the acquisition to fail or it was instead calling E.U. regulators' bluffs, given prior reports that the deal was previously set to win unconditional approval.\n\nInvestors were already on edge this week after a U.S. federal judge blocked a separate pending merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines and amid worries that an FTC meeting scheduled for next week on an undisclosed topic might involve the Amazon-iRobot merger.\n\nAfter the regular market session closed today, however, The Wall Street Journalreported that in a meeting with European Commission (EC) officials earlier today, Amazon representatives were told that the deal would likely be rejected in the absence of concessions to address the E.U.'s antitrust concerns.\n\nWhat's next for iRobot investors?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Amazon will push forward with the acquisition. The $1.7 billion purchase consideration for the deal is relatively inconsequential to the tech giant, given its $1.59 trillion market capitalization. But bringing iRobot under its wing would also significantly bolster Amazon's smart-home ambitions, particularly given iRobot's enviable trove of smart-home and robotic navigation patents.\n\nStory continues\n\niRobot could also continue its path as a stand-alone company -- albeit with some work to do to reramp research & development and sales & marketing expenditures and to clean up its balance sheet after taking on additional debt to fund operations as it awaited the deal's completion.\n\nIn the meantime, it's no surprise to see iRobot stock falling on this news.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "It’s understandable for investors to feel nervous right now. A few weeks into the New Year and markets are looking rocky. Indexes in the United Sates are in the red to start 2024 and the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is back above 4%. Furthermore, futures traders now see a 63% chance of an interest rate cut in March of this year, down from 81% as recently as Jan. 12. Looking beyond the U.S., inflation unexpectedly rose in the United Kingdom and Canada during December. This inflation further dampened expectations for interest rate cuts. Fear not! There are still some blue-chip stocks to buy that won’t keep you up at night.\n\nChina’s economy slowed more than expected in the fourth-quarter of 2023, and violence is spreading across the Middle East. There’s seemingly no end of things for investors to fret about. The good news is that there are some stocks that investors can buy and sleep soundly owning. These are so called “set it and forget it” stocks. Blue-chip companies whose shares perform well in any type of market—bull or bear. Here are three stocks to buy that won’t keep you up at night.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A / BRK.B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A / NYSE:BRK.B) is about as blue-chip as stocks get. The holding company of legendary investor Warren Buffett owns a diverse array of businesses ranging from the BNSF railway to General Re insurance and Jordan’s Furniture. And the company just completed its latest acquisition, taking full control of Pilot Travel Centers, the largest operator of truck stops in the U.S. and neighboring Canada.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire acquired the remaining 20% of Pilot Travel Centers that it didn’t already own from the Haslam family that also owns the Cleveland Browns NFL football team. Pilot Travel Centers operates more than 750 truck stop locations across the U.S. and Canada, and was one of the largest private companies in America before Berkshire purchased it. Buffett brokered the deal to buy Pilot in three stages—an initial purchase of 40% in 2017, a subsequent sale of 40% in early 2023, and the final sale of 20% now.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is also well-known for having a massive stock portfolio that’s worth $355 billion and comprised mostly of other blue-chip stocks such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). Berkshire’s more affordable Class B stock has gained 15% in the last 12 months and 77% over the past five years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another reliable investment that people can feel good about. The e-commerce company has got its house in order after the pandemic and seems to be doing all the right things as it continues to diversify its business. Most recently, Amazon announced the launch of a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can answer shoppers’ questions about a specific product. The new AI model provides answers to questions it receives by summarizing product reviews and the online listing. Amazon easily earns its spot on our list of blue-chip stocks to buy that won’t keep you up at night.\n\nThe feature is aimed at saving shoppers time scrolling through pages of online reviews or reading through a listing to find information about a product they’re considering purchasing. Amazon said the new tool is designed not to veer off subject and will return an error message if it can’t answer a question. This is one of the many ways that Amazon is using AI, including to generate product reviews, help third-party sellers write listings, and forecast inventory.\n\nAMZN stock has increased 58% in the last 12 months and is up 80% over five years.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nQuick service restaurant chain McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is another steady blue-chip stock that won’t keep you up at night. Not only does the Big Mac maker have an enviable track record of posting strong financial results, but it is also a dividend powerhouse, having increased its quarterly distribution to shareholders for 47 consecutive years, ever since paying its first dividend back in 1976. Today, MCD stock pays a quarterly dividend of $1.67 a share for a yield of 2.29%.\n\nAlso impressive is that McDonald’s remains in growth mode. In December, the Chicago-based company announced plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. For this year, McDonald’s is projecting net new restaurant growth of 4%. After next year, the company plans to grow its restaurant count by 5% annually. McDonald’s executives have said that by 2027 they want to have 50,000 restaurant locations worldwide.\n\nMCD stock has gained 6% in the last 12 months and is up 60% over five years.

        "content": "Companies around the world are all facing an interesting dilemma in 2024, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy: their biggest problems and solutions might be one and the same.\n\n“The opportunity and risk is pretty similar in that there is this wildly transformative, disruptive technology in generative AI that you can’t get through any conversation without talking about,” Jassy says.\n\nAt a dinner in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Jassy told Fortune CEO Alan Murray that prior to the pandemic, companies were largely moving to modernize their preexisting technology to innovate and lower costs. But the pandemic prompted them to think about saving money by any means necessary, and the mainstreaming of generative AI a few years later allowed them to dream about cost savings on a whole different level.\n\nNow, it seems they’re at somewhat of an impasse about how to proceed.\n\n“I just see companies really battling with prioritization between are they better off continuing with that modernization of their technology platform, or should they spend all their new engineering resources on generative AI,” Jassy says.\n\nBut it’s not as simple as picking a single option, he adds. If companies don’t have their technology infrastructure in place, it’s going to be hard for them to be successful in AI.\n\n“It’s such a sure win to be able to modernize your technology, move to the cloud. That to me is a very predictable payback,” Jassy says. “Yet at the same time, it would be foolish not to figure out how to use generative AI successfully.”\n\nIt’s ultimately going to have to be a balance, Jassy says, with every company prioritizing what works best for them. He predicts that most companies will probably opt for the more sure path forward, modernizing their tech, and then investing in one or two AI initiatives that benefit their customer experience, and where they can learn how to be successful using AI..\n\nSince OpenAI introduced its ChatGPT large language model chatbot to the public in November 2022, AI has become an almost single-minded focus of companies around the world. Excitement around the tech has forced tech giants like Google to hurry and launch their own chatbots.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has been working on AI for years, but announced the launch of its business chatbot called Q in November of 2023. The chatbot is built on 17 years of Amazon Web Services knowledge and is meant to help employees with things like streamlining tasks and communications, generating blog posts, summarizing content, as well as writing and analyzing code.\n\nAmazon has also invested around $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, a San Francisco-based company founded by former OpenAI staff. Anthropic launched its gen AI chatbot Claude to a broad audience in March 2023.\n\nJassy told Fortune on Thursday that Amazon is currently building some 60 other AI applications, but added that it’s still “early days” in the AI revolution.\n\n“This is like three steps into a marathon,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence and penny stocks don’t necessarily go together like peanut butter and jelly, but there is some allure to AI penny stocks for risk-tolerant investors.\n\nIn 2023, companies were bending over backward to announce their AI bona fides. That trend will continue in 2024. But analysts and investors alike are becoming more selective. Specifically, they want to see AI that makes a difference and that contributes to a company’s bottom lines.\n\nThat will typically lead investors to large-cap stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, those large-cap companies come with a rich valuation. A better alternative for risk-tolerant investors may come from AI penny stocks. These are loosely defined as stocks that trade for less than $5 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe benefit of penny stocks is that investors can own a significant amount of shares for a minimal investment. And if they discover the next Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in their infancy, their portfolios are set.\n\nNevertheless, finding the best AI penny stocks requires as much, if not more, discernment than finding other stocks. Here are three candidates to consider in 2024.\n\n2U (TWOU) 2u education stocks\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome love it; some hate it, but online learning is here to stay. 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU) operates an online learning platform. And in May 2023, the company launched two AI-powered learning assistants build on ChatGPT. The assistants reside on the company’s edX platform.\n\nSo far, the launch isn’t making much, if any, impact on the company’s revenue and – more importantly – it’s earnings, which remain negative. This is a very small company with a market cap of just over $72 million. Micro-cap stocks such as TWOU were punished in 2023.\n\nNevertheless, the company has had the support of Cathie Wood at different times. That may be a reason that analysts remain bullish on TWOU stock. The consensus price target of $2.40 is 172% higher than the price as of the market close on January 16, 2024. The stock also gets a Strong Buy rating from one out of the seven analysts that offer a rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne more thing that speculative investors should consider is that over 90% of the company’s stock is owned by institutional investors. That’s not common for a tiny company like 2U. Do with that as you will.\n\nPredictive Oncology (POAI) A doctor points at an abstract representation of various aspects of oncology. SHPH stock\n\nSource: Oleg Ivanov IL / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most compelling possibilities for AI is in the field of drug development. Predictive Oncology (NASDAQ:POAI) intends to make that process significantly shorter. The company says it currently takes 12 years, on average, to bring a new cancer drug to market. And in the last 20 years, only 115 out of approximately 1,500 cancer drugs successfully made it through the clinical trial stage.\n\nThat’s where AI and machine learning come into play. The company’s PeDAL AI platform has as its goal the ability to identify the drug candidates with the highest possibility for success, and to do so in less time.\n\nIn November 2023, Predictive Oncologycompleted a multi-year study with UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. The goal of the study was to use AI and machine learning models to learn associations between the datasets and the short- and long-term survival rates of ovarian cancer patients.\n\nThat’s the good news. The bad news is that Predictive Oncology is not profitable, generates very little revenue, and continues to burn through cash. There is currently no analyst coverage on POAI stock, which is down 70% in the last 12 months. Nevertheless, if you can stomach that kind of risk, the potential upside for a company that may help save lives is hard to ignore.\n\nRekor Systems (REKR) Security Video Camera Vehicle number identification system. Rekor Systems *REKR) makes vehicle identification, artificial intelligence.\n\nSource: Al Serov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRekor Systems (NASDAQ:REKR) is a technology company that uses AI and machine learning for “intelligent infrastructure solutions.” This includes areas such as smart cities, however, one area that jumps out as we enter an election year is public safety.\n\nMany cities are wrestling with the idea of how to do more with less. Tools such as Rekor Scout, which “enables accurate license plate and vehicle recognition” is one solution that Rekor provides.\n\nUnlike many AI penny stocks, REKR stock is up 91% in the last 12 months. That may have some investors concerned that any future growth is fully priced in. The stock isn’t widely covered by analysts and only 40% of the stock is owned by institutional investors. However, two analysts do give the stock a price target of $4.50 which would be a 16% upside from its current level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Internet - Commerce stocks have likely encountered both Prosus N.V. Sponsored ADR (PROSY) and Amazon (AMZN). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nBoth Prosus N.V. Sponsored ADR and Amazon have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nPROSY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 3.18, while AMZN has a forward P/E of 41.64. We also note that PROSY has a PEG ratio of 0.07. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.46.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for PROSY is its P/B ratio of 4.81. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

        "title": "7 Retail Stocks to Buy in a Strengthening U.S. Job Market",
        "content": "After such an impressive response in both the market and the economy against serious headwinds, investors may have initially wanted to reduce their exposure to discretionary-focused retail stocks to buy. Basically, lightning might not strike twice. However, the most recent jobs report for December may have reset expectations.\n\nFirst, the print landed at 216,000 new jobs added last month. In contrast, economists expected only 170,000 positions gained. As well, the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%. However, experts before the disclosure saw a rise to 3.8%. What does this all translate to? An unexpectedly higher volume of more dollars chasing after fewer goods.\n\nThat’s inflationary and that may help drive down the relative value of the dollar. And such a dynamic has a clear impact on retail stocks to buy. Last year, circumstances were difficult for many businesses in part because the personal saving rate increased. And it made sense that it did because a greenback that’s worth more incentivizes savings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, a greenback that’s worth less over time? That’s inflationary and that incentives spending. In turn, the below retail stocks to buy offer a compelling argument.\n\nSimon Property Group (SPG) building facade of simon property group (SPG)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA questionable enterprise prior to the Covid-19 disaster because of the much-discussed death of America’s shopping malls, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) really took a beating when the SARS-Cov-2 virus first came knocking. Structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), Simon Property focuses on shopping malls, outlet centers and community/lifestyle centers. During the worst of the pandemic, few people wanted to be around strangers.\n\nHowever, the concept of retail revenge – or pent-up demand for activities and experiences denied – helped lift SPG from the 2020 doldrums. In the past 52 weeks, SPG gained more than 16% of equity value, a respectable performance. Notably, SPG swung higher as rumors hit that the Federal Reserve was contemplating interest rate cuts. Again, a relatively devalued dollar encourages spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be fair, SPG suffers from question marks due to wider questions about the brick-and-mortar retail model. However, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a high-side target of $172. Thus, it could be one of the retail stocks to buy.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top names in the big-box retail space, Target (NYSE:TGT) initially appeared intriguing because of the retail revenge phenomenon. However, management disclosed last year the impact that shoplifting had on profitability. Obviously, that didn’t seem like a particularly encouraging announcement considering wider sensibilities. Basically, Target was communicating that it had little recourse other than to suck it up or close down the most problematic stores.\n\nHowever, late last year, Target reported a better-than-expected earnings print. As well, the company reported robust results for the Black Friday shopping season. All in all, the big-box retailer demonstrated that despite consumer challenges, shoppers were continuing to visit Target locations. That meant that the company enjoyed some brand power, a not-insignificant advantage in an ultra-competitive cycle.\n\nFinancially, Target enjoys a 15.7% three-year revenue growth rate, beating out 83.45% of its peers. Also, its return on invested capital (ROIC) – the ability to convert capital into profitable investments – comes in at 10.5%, better than 75.32% of the sector. Thus, TGT ranks among the retail stocks to buy.\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nSource: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Bolingbrook, Illinois, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is a chain of beauty stores. While a relevant sector, a tough economic backdrop hurt investor sentiment. In the past 52 weeks, ULTA shares dipped more than 5%. With high inflation and high borrowing costs, many consumers opted for cheaper alternatives – the trade-down effect. However, if interest rates decline, ULTA could be one of the retail stocks to buy.\n\nFor one thing, with more people having more discretionary funds to spend, increased demand for pampering should be expected. Moving forward, we could see Ulta leveraging its on-site beauty salons. As well, consumers may opt for top shelf, higher-margin products. Both may help reinvigorate sentiment. Indeed, ULTA popped higher late last year, coinciding with lower interest rate rumors.\n\nFinancially, Ulta performs quite well with a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.7%, beating out almost 77% of its rivals. However, the real star could be the ROIC which clocks in at 31%, above 96% of competitors. Thus, it’s an intriguing prospect for retail stocks to buy.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother beneficiary of a better-than-expected jobs report could be Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Practically a cultural icon at this point, Starbucks fuels a large chunk of the U.S. economy. How so? In addition to hiring countless thousands of people – thus providing first-time work experience for many – the brand also keeps workers focused. According to the National Coffee Association of USA, seven in 10 Americans drink coffee every week.\n\nInvariably, a large volume of this consumption stems from Starbucks. Now, the narrative understandably encountered challenges in 2023. You can tell by its 52-week loss of almost 13%. That’s very un-Starbucks like. However, with the dollar rising in relative value due to higher interest rates, people naturally chose to save their greenbacks.\n\nMoving forward, more people should have more dollars from more jobs being worked. That should give increased discretionary purchasing power. Also, because these dollars will be worth less over time, an incentive exists to do something with it.\n\nWhy not reward yourself with Starbucks? Analysts see a price target of $110, making SBUX one of the retail stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nMentioning Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as one of the retail stocks to buy may be controversial because of its impact. As The New York Times pointed out a few years back, mom-and-pop stores just can’t compete with the e-commerce juggernaut. So, Amazon’s giant vacuum cleaner continues to scour the nation, devastating small businesses and enlarging itself. It’s an ugly situation but you can’t argue with the results.\n\nIn the past 52 weeks, AMZN gained nearly 59% of equity value. Yes, it’s still off from its all-time highs. However, the security’s downturn in 2022 appears a forgotten memory. Further, if the Fed actually goes through with interest rate cuts, Amazon may have some more time with blue skies. In an inflationary cycle, more dollars will chase after fewer goods. As stated before, this should incentivize spending.\n\nTo be clear, AMZN is no discount, trading at 78.61X trailing-year earnings. However, the company enjoys a massive three-year revenue growth rate of 21.9%. Also, it features a very decent ROIC of 6.84%. Unsurprisingly, it’s a unanimous strong buy among 42 expert voices.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuring the worst of the pandemic, a few retail stocks to buy offered surprising relevance. One such company was Nike (NYSE:NKE). A popular athletic apparel and sports equipment manufacturer, when enterprises shifted abruptly to remote work protocols, demand for traditional office attire declined. In its place were hoodies and sweatpants and other super-casual attire – things that Nike specializes in.\n\nHowever, with the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy in 2022, NKE incurred a steep correction. Last year, shares were all over the map. In the past 52 weeks, NKE dropped more than 20% of equity value. Further, the company faces competitive pressures as small rivals aim to take market share in the athletic apparel ecosystem.\n\nStill, for speculators, Nike may deserve a second look because of its brand and pricing power. For example, in the quarter ended November 2023, Nike’s gross margin stood at 44.6%. That was noticeably above the year-ago quarter’s print of 42.89%. This indicates that consumers overall gravitate toward Nike, making it one of the retail stocks to buy.\n\nAutoNation (AN) Exterior of the Autonation Toyota car dealership\n\nSource: RYO Alexandre / Shutterstock.com\n\nA contrarian idea among retail stocks to buy, AutoNation (NYSE:AN) undoubtedly presents risks. Yes, a currency that devalues over time incentivizes some action toward it, including spending it. Otherwise, if you hold the cash, you will basically incur a hidden tax. It’s just not a smart thing to do but to buy a car? That doesn’t seem very smart either.\n\nHowever, the reality is that for many people in the U.S. – particularly those outside of metropolitan areas on the east coast – a personal vehicle is a necessity. That’s one of the reasons many Californians don’t like environmental protocols that attempt to push residents into more sustainable transportation. Having a car is an absolute necessity in many areas because the public transportation system is a joke.\n\nBut here’s another, more important factor at play: the cars on our roadways are old. In 2023, the average age of passenger vehicles hit a record 12.5 years. As advanced as reliability statistics have become, mechanical devices always break down.\n\nCombined with possibly lower interest rates, more people may be attracted to replacement vehicles. That should be a sizable boon for AutoNation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia. Photo: Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters (©Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters)\n\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 gains (^GSPC) last year but can they repeat those extraordinary returns in 2024?\n\nThis group of mega-cap tech giants – Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) – are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing.\n\nIn 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500.\n\nHere’s what to expect as Tesla kicks off the mega-caps’ reporting season on 24 January.\n\nTesla (TSLA) – reporting on 24 January\n\nShares in Elon Musk’s EV maker doubled in value over 2023, gaining 102%, as the company is expected to report revenues of $25.5bn (£20.1bn).\n\nTesla has reported 485,000 deliveries for Q4 2023, marking an increase of about 20% versus the last year.\n\n“Tesla has already given insight into its performance via the quarterly vehicle production and delivery data released ahead of the financial results. In the fourth quarter it produced 494,989 vehicles and delivered 484,507 vehicles, the bulk of which were Model 3 or Y,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\n“It managed to hit a 1.8 million annual delivery target which effectively gave it breathing space amid market worries that competition was biting at its heels, particularly China’s BYD which surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles last quarter,” he added.\n\nThere are concerns around a stall in its automotive sales with no new model launch and delayed Cybertruck ramp-up.\n\nAnalyst forecast for the next set of quarterly results is $0.72 earnings per share.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – reporting on 30 January\n\nMicrosoft managed to steal the title of most valuable company in the world from Apple in 2024, with the software giant’s bet on AI paying off.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella has made a push for Microsoft to assume a global leadership role in AI. The company has a significant stake in leading AI startup ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, and reportedly invested up to $13bn in the startup.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis alliance has been considered one of the tech industry’s most lucrative tie-ups.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft’s market capitalisation stood at $2.895tn, a new record high for the company, and above Apple’s market cap of $2.825tn.\n\nThe last time the software giant earned the title of most valuable company in the world was back in 2021.\n\nThe consensus analyst forecast for the next set of quarterly results is earnings per share at $2.29 and revenue at $52.94bn.\n\nRead more: FTSE top trending tickers of 2023\n\n“The big issues are whether Microsoft can sustain robust growth in cloud computing and how it can take AI to the next level,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Seen by most as the dominant AI software play, its apps are already critical to millions of businesses, so wrapping functionality into Windows, Microsoft 365, Azure and more through its Copilot tools offers immense potential.\n\n“It is not all champagne and caviar for Microsoft. Its success has naturally attracted the attention of various regulators and competition authorities and like its mega cap peers, there are growing concerns that the company has become too dominant. Antitrust probes are likely to be a key focus for investors in 2024.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) – reporting on 30 January\n\nThe search engine giant appears to be playing catch-up in the AI race and announced hundreds of job cuts in an effort to reduce costs. But the stock is still a buy with most analysts given its powerful free cash flow.\n\nMost analysts are expecting Alphabet to report a 12% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, to $85.26bn, which should translate to a 51% increase in per-share earnings to $1.60, up from $1.05 in the same year-ago period.\n\n“Alphabet has beaten market expectations for both earnings per share and revenue over the past three consecutive quarterly results. Investors will be hoping it can make it four in a row on 30 January,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Cloud computing is the big unknown – one minute Alphabet is thriving in this area, the next it cannot sustain growth momentum. Competition is fierce and this is a difficult one to call ahead of the results.\n\n“YouTube continues to go from strength to strength, with millions of people now treating the platform as a priority place to consume content.\n\nApple (AAPL) – reporting on 30 January\n\nApple has taken overtaken Samsung (005930.KS)as the world’s biggest phone maker but that might not be enough to convince investors amid dwindling iPhone sales in China.\n\nApple added $1tn in market cap in 2023 even as it has reported revenue declines from the prior year in four consecutive quarters.\n\nAnalysts forecast Apple to report $2.09 earnings per share and $118bn revenue amid weakness in China and global waning demand for Mac computers and iPads.\n\n“The company used to have a reputation for bringing out truly innovative products and shaking up the marketplace. In recent years that reputation has soured as there have only been new iterations of the same products,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“The momentous change could be the Vision Pro headset which goes on sale in February 2024. While the $3,500 price point looks high, people pay that for high-end laptops and this could feasibly be another ‘must-have’ product for Apple fans.\n\n“The key issue to monitor is whether Apple’s output can meet demand as last year there were reports it had to drastically cut production forecasts for the Vision Pro due to the complexity of its design.”\n\nMeta Platforms (META) – reporting on 1 February\n\nIts year of efficiency, that saw the company pivot away from the metaverse push, allowed Meta to achieve a remarkable return of 194% in 2023.\n\nHowever, what can investors expect when Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook owner, sold almost half a billion dollars’ worth of the company’s shares at the end of last year. It was the first time he sold shares in almost two years.\n\nAnalysts forecast $4.96 earnings per share in Meta’s fourth quarter for 2023 versus a $1.76 per share loss in the same period a year earlier. Revenue is estimated be $39bn versus $34.15bn one quarter earlier.\n\n“The results are likely to include a reiteration that expenses are going to rise in 2024, driven by higher infrastructure-related costs and investment in AI. The hype around the metaverse has died down but it continues to plug away at the concept and any success from Apple’s Vision Pro headset could revive public interest in virtual worlds,” Coatsworth said.\n\nRead more: ChatGPT portfolio outperforms the UK’s top 10 most popular funds\n\n“Meta has a big folder of AI ideas such as language translation and Instagram users reimagining their photos, but these seem unlikely to generate meaningful revenue, so advertising will remain key in terms of income for the near future,” he added.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – reporting on 21 February\n\nAmazon saw its stock surge 81% in 2023 and is betting that generative AI will produce tens of billions in revenue for Amazon Web Services in the next few years.\n\nAmazon aims to be a dominant player in the market despite being slow to invest in this technology.\n\nThe company also has a strong position in TV, film and music streaming and although the stock is not inexpensive, shares are the cheapest they have been in over 10 years.\n\nAmazon has guided for net sales between $160bn and $167bn, equating to 7% to 12% growth versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The analyst consensus forecast is $0.78 earnings per share and $165.86bn revenue.\n\n“The uncertain economic outlook raises the prospect that companies are continuing to find new ways to save money including paring back IT costs which could be problematic for Amazon’s cloud computing division. Potentially offsetting this issue is greater corporate interest in AI which could benefit the group,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Amazon has been rolling out new versions of AI chips which it said offer enhanced performance and announced plans to invest up to $4bn in Anthropic, a US company generating AI systems and large language models. AI may be the ‘hot theme’ in tech but keeping up with rivals, let alone overtaking them, can be a costly exercise,” he added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – reporting on 21 February\n\nThe AI boom of these tech mega-caps would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year.\n\nWith demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year.\n\nThe analyst consensus forecast for its next quarterly results is $4.49 earnings per share and $20.06bn revenue.\n\nRead more: How AI boom will benefit these nine chipmakers in 2024\n\n“Nvidia is going all-in on AI, believing the world is on the cusp of a radical shift in technology usage. Companies in every industry are exploring ways to deploy AI to improve productivity and that creates a huge runway for Nvidia to grow its earnings,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Its key challenge is to keep up with demand and to keep innovating, rolling out new products that can help companies while also ensuring it remains at the forefront of the AI industry. Nvidia is the dominant force in market and there is no room for complacency, otherwise competition will be biting at its heels,” he added.\n\nWatch: Why tech will still be 'one of the leaders' in 2024<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/magnificent-seven-continue-dominating-markets-210500660.html\\\">nonstop talks of the Magnificent Seven and AI</a>.

        "title": "5 Stocks to Buy as Retail Sales Soar on Solid Holiday Spending",
        "content": "The retail sector is staging a solid comeback, surpassing economists’ forecasts and roaring back to normal as inflation continues to ease. Retail sales totaled $709.9 billion, increasing 0.6% month over month in December and beating the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.4%, the Commerce Department said on Jan 17.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, retail sales grew 5.6% in December. Sales primarily got a boost from the holiday season shopping that saw Americans spending lavishly on buying goods. Online sales rose 1.5% in December on a month-over-month basis.\n\nNine of the 13 categories in the retail sector recorded growth. Sales at clothing and accessories stores increased 1.5%. Sales at restaurants increased 11.3% year over year in December.\n\nCore retail sales, which excludes auto and gas, increased 4.9% year over year. On a month-over-month basis, core retail sales jumped 0.6%.\n\nThe report once again shows the underlying strength in the economy as it entered the new year, with expectations soaring of the Federal Reserve going for interest rate cuts.\n\nThe retail sector took a major hit last year as the Federal Reserve took an aggressive monetary tightening stance to curb multi-decade-high inflation. The central bank increased interest rates by 525 basis points since Mach 2022, compelling consumers to spend cautiously and cut down on expenditures.\n\nHowever, the retail sector put up a solid fight and sales increased at a steady pace. The December report comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is planning to end its interest rate hikes and go for rate cuts.\n\nRate cuts bode well for the retail sector as lower borrowing costs will allow consumers to spend more freely, which will drive sales.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven the encouraging economic environment and increase in retail sales, it would be prudent for savvy investors to consider betting on retail stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY, Target Corporation TGT, Abercrombie & Fitch ANF and The Gap, Inc. GPS that stand to benefit directly from these favorable conditions.Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.3% over the past 60 days. CASY presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nTarget Corporation has evolved from just being a pure brick & mortar retailer to an omni-channel entity. TGT has been making investments in technologies, improving websites and mobile apps and modernizing the supply chain to keep pace with the changing retail landscape and better compete with pure e-commerce players.

        "title": "3 supply chain software providers tell their latest stories at NRF",
        "content": "The NRF annual meeting in NY is a good place for supply chain software providers to hawk their wares. (Photo: FreightWaves)\n\nNEW YORK — The National Retail Federation is not a supply chain conference per se. But it might as well be.\n\nA walk through the gigantic two main exhibition floors at the Jacob K. Javits Center brings the NRF attendees to a line of displays, many of them enormous, that seem to focus heavily on a definition of supply chain that encompasses not just getting products to retail outlets, but also to the final mile and final handling that put a product into the hands of consumers.\n\nThat is why three heavyweights of the supply chain — Manhattan Associates, Blue Yonder and the newly created AWS Supply Chain segment of Amazon Web Services — set up shop on those floors to tout their offerings, some of which have recently gone through significant additions or overhauls.\n\nTwo companies visited by FreightWaves at the NRF meeting have new initiatives: Blue Yonder through its acquisition in October of Doddle, a U.K. company that specializes in reverse logistics; and AWS Supply Chain, launched early last year primarily as an inventory management tool.\n\nAlso in one of the larger booths, Manhattan Associates (NASDAQ: MANH) is a supply chain software provider that is publicly traded and that in the past 52 weeks has seen its stock soar by more than 76%.\n\nBlue Yonder: Tackling the tricky issue of returns\n\nThe Blue Yonder acquisition of Doddle was notable on several fronts, in particular the fact that this supply chain software behemoth is now going to be interacting with a part of commerce it hadn’t previously dealt with directly: the buyer or gift recipient of a product he or she no longer wants. That sort of one-to-one contact point didn’t exist before in the Blue Yonder world, according to Tim Robinson, the co-founder and CEO of Doddle and now a vice president with Blue Yonder.\n\nRobinson described a process in most supply chains in which handling of returns was generally somewhat disorganized, enough to disrupt other parts of the supply chain that might otherwise have been well structured. That returns are an issue in the supply chain could easily be discerned from walking through the NRF floor; numerous companies touted returns services.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In the vast majority of cases, consumer returns are arriving back at warehouses blind,” Robinson said. A consumer likely took a label off the initial packaging, slapped it on some sort of packing and  sent it off via FedEx, UPS or the U.S. Postal Service. Before receipt of the package, there is no data or signal to the warehouse that the return is on its way. For a well-oiled supply chain, this is a significant instance of throwing a wrench in the gears.\n\n“It’s just a hugely inefficient way of running warehouses,” Robinson said. So from the perspective of a freight company looking downstream from its perch on its supply chain, returns might seem miles away from the company’s own issues, but Robinson painted a picture in which reverse logistics can back up into broader operations. Tim Robinson of Blue Yonder\n\nOne example is how the method of returns impacts supply chain costs. Robinson said if a return is sent back to the warehouse through a company like FedEx, it costs far more than if it is sent back to a retail outlet where it is easier to inject it into a supply chain that includes a warehouse.\n\nBlue Yonder is looking to Doddle to help customers find ways to direct returns into those lower-cost channels, if possible, because that then has an impact on overall inventory levels.\n\nThe data that comes from the Doddle/Blue Yonder returns interface that will now be supplied to their customers will provide a stream of information that makes more efficient processes possible, Robinson said. Beyond finding a way to get a product back to a warehouse more efficiently, Robinson said that interface can also help the supply chain determine “where the item sits in its lifespan.” “If this is an item that has a six-week sales cycle, we know we don’t need to rush that item back in 24 hours,” he said.\n\nRobinson contrasted the system of returns in most warehouses with Blue Yonder’s other offerings. “We have transport management tools which say you’re at the point where you’ve now decided where you’re going to put these products, then we can schedule trucks on docks, the drivers and the workforce to be able to make that happen,” he said.\n\nWhat Blue Yonder didn’t have, he added, was “the tool that deals with the return and reverse logistics.” Hence the Doddle acquisition.\n\nManhattan Associates: Post-COVID, companies look to upgrade\n\nRob Schaefer is the vice president of transportation management sales at Manhattan Associates. Schaefer said Manhattan’s TMS offering among its enormous suite of supply chain products is targeted toward larger companies with an annual freight-under-management figure of $25 million.\n\n“We’re looking at higher freight spends, and we’re looking for complexity,” Schaefer said of the average Manhattan client. “And what I mean when I say complexity is I’m looking for all modes of transportation. I’m looking for ocean, air, truckload, LTL, intermodal. I want inbound and outbound.”\n\nManhattan Associates’ warehouse management system is called Active.\n\nSchaefer said the company is seeing an increase in potential TMS clients who found themselves trying to get through COVID with more antiquated systems, including spreadsheets. These companies weren’t reaching out to Manhattan Associates during the pandemic because “they’re just trying to get capacity going ‘and I don’t care what it costs.’ So the uptick is post-COVID.”\n\nBut with COVID in “the rearview mirror, now is when we’re seeing a lot more happening with our TMS system,” Schaefer said.\n\nIn that review of how supply chains handled COVID, Schaefer said many companies realized that “all the systems we had didn’t talk to each other. That wasn’t good.” Another realization was that some parts of a supply chain might still have been on spreadsheets.\n\n“So now they’re looking at it from a holistic perspective,” he added. The Active system bills itself as that type of “single solution.” “We’re not writing the integration between things,” he said, with tools that bring together different systems; Manhattan’s approach would be to put everything on the one Active platform.\n\nManhattan Associates also used the occasion of the NRF conference to announce several initiatives. One is a Fulfillment Experience Insights dashboard, giving real-time updates on fulfillment. A second is a Point of Sale application for use in a store. The third is a joint venture with e-commerce platform Shopify (NYSE: SHOP). The capabilities of the two companies will work in tandem to serve the e-commerce needs of retailer clients.\n\nAWS Supply Chain: A new initiative from the giant\n\nAWS Supply Chain hasn’t been around even a year. Its formation under the banner of Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN) was announced in late 2022, and it commenced operations in April 2023.\n\nThe announcement was boilerplate. AWS Supply Chain “helps businesses increase supply chain visibility to make faster, more informed decisions that mitigate risks, save costs, and improve customer experiences.” What that doesn’t reveal is that its focus is very much on inventory.\n\nDiego Pantoja-Navajas, vice president of AWS Supply Chain, said at the NRF meeting that “what we have learned the most from our customers is that they were either overstocking themselves or understocking themselves.” Pantoja-Navajas also said AWS customers found that they often had just-in-time inventory practices, which may have worked for years but were a disastrous policy in the post-pandemic months when there were short supplies of so many items.\n\nThe basic process used by AWS Supply Chain is to take disparate data that an enterprise is generating through its potentially multiple enterprise resource planning (ERP) software systems and aggregate what the data is showing about inventories.\n\nPantoja-Navajas used SAP as an example of a company whose processes a warehouse or intermediate supplier of goods might be using for various ERPs. The customers for Amazon Supply Chain, Pantoja-Navajas said, “would have all their supply chain data in SAP, the vendors, the facilities, the products, the purchase orders, the inventory and all that,” he said. What Amazon Supply Chain does is provide a “connector” to SAP “and extracts all the information from SAP into AWS Supply Chain. That data is then fed into a “data lake which is created to store any supply chain data.”\n\nA demonstration of the system at the AWS booth at NRF showed a mockup of a screen with inventory levels and notifications of possible excesses and shortages. “It’s going to look at inventory throughout your network wherever it is deployed,” Pantoja-Navajas said. “That’s whether it’s a warehouse or distribution center of a manufacturing facility.”\n\nAWS Supply Chain already has rolled out new services in its product. Announced in late November, the products bring generative AI to the Supply Chain product, data on carbon emissions of shipments, and two forecasting tools: Supply Planning and N-Tier Visibility.\n\nIn much the same way that Schaefer talked about post-pandemic analysis driving customer behavior at Manhattan Associates, Pantoja-Navajas was asked what took AWS so long to produce a product when the need seemed obvious. “I think that more than anything, COVID left a lot of companies wanting to get better and build a much more resilient supply chain for their own use,” he said.\n\nAnd with the extensive reach of AWS, “data was there from the relationship with partners; relationships with partners existed, so we learned a lot from that event.”\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nFrom pandemic chaos to AI, supply chain panelists have seen it all lately\n\nSupreme Court rejects review in broker liablity case, leaving the issue unresolved\n\nSoCal warehouse emissions rule and possible impact on trucks upheld by judge\n\nThe post 3 supply chain software providers tell their latest stories at NRF appeared first on FreightWaves.",

        "title": "Shopify Stock (NYSE:SHOP): No Margin of Safety",
        "content": "Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), a leading global e-commerce solutions provider, has disrupted online shopping over the last decade with its innovative subscription model. However, on the back of a 107% price increase in the last 12 months, Shopify stock lacks a margin of safety today, which calls for investors to be cautious at these prices. Although the company is moving in the right direction to expand its target market, I am neutral on Shopify based on valuation concerns.\n\nProfitable Growth: Shopify’s New Mantra\n\nShopify has been one of the fastest-growing tech companies in the last decade, and the company, until recently, followed a strategy of growth at any cost. Aided by this aggressive strategy, Shopify’s revenue grew from just $50.3 million in 2013 to $5.6 billion in 2022, which is a testament to how the company has grown in leaps and bounds. Despite stellar revenue growth, though, the firm has failed to maintain profitability.\n\nToday, Shopify is changing its strategy to strike a balance between growth and profits, which is an encouraging sign.\n\nAfter struggling to compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to gain market share in the fulfillment services sector, the company decided to sell most of its Logistics assets to Flexport last May. This deal marked the first step in Shopify’s journey to prioritize its E-Commerce business while distancing itself from unprofitable business operations.\n\nAfter a major slump in operating income that pushed Shopify into losses, the company made a strong comeback in the third quarter to report just over $120 million in operating income. This marked the first positive operating income after six consecutive quarters of losses. This notable improvement was supported by a 23% year-over-year decline in operating expenses supported by a lower headcount and the sale of its Logistics business.\n\nShopify reported free cash flows of $276 million for the third quarter as well, or 16% of revenue, which is a testament to the company’s strong comeback. With a long runway to grow globally, Shopify’s focus on profitability is exciting, as it will pave the way for the company to grow sustainably, creating long-lasting shareholder wealth in the process.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew Partnerships to Drive Growth\n\nAfter divesting its Logistics business, Shopify partnered with Amazon during the third quarter to offer fast and free Prime delivery for its merchants. Joining hands with Amazon’s Buy with Prime program, Shopify offers the best of both worlds to merchants where they get to customize their stores and maintain personalized branding while benefiting from the wide reach and industry-leading logistics network owned by Amazon.\n\nShopify is reportedly partnering with X, formerly Twitter, to drive sales as well. The official X Business account announced on January 10 that X and Shopify will partner to bring seamless integration of e-commerce onto the social media platform. This marks a big win for Shopify, as its merchants and products will have the opportunity to sell to a massive new audience with this collaboration.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Shopify signed a commercial agreement with Flexport to offer fast, affordable, and reliable logistics solutions to its merchants. This new partnership will offer Shopify merchants all the benefits of a strong logistics network without the company having to bear the costs of maintaining such a network.\n\nOverall, Shopify is making steady progress with its partnership strategy to expand into new markets while offering value-accretive solutions to its merchants. All this comes without a hit to the company’s financial health, which is the real highlight.\n\nKeeping a Foot on the Investment Pedal\n\nDespite focusing on managing costs, Shopify has not committed the cardinal sin of abandoning planned investments to grow the business. The company is investing in the future with a few key focus areas.\n\nFirst, Shopify is enhancing its platform to provide a more personalized experience. These investments should help retain merchants in the long run, leading to long-lasting competitive advantages.\n\nSecond, the company is investing in machine learning and AI technology to improve fraud detection technology and the underwriting process, in addition to integrating these technologies to enhance Shopify Payments.\n\nShopify has grown rapidly in recent years to serve multi-billion-dollar enterprises, but small- and medium-sized enterprises still contribute a meaningful share of revenue and profits. Investments to improve the underlying technology stack used by Shopify will help the company retain these customers in the long run, as they are offered an unbeatable value proposition.\n\nThird, Shopify is investing in new features to enhance the functionality of its platform. A good example is the company’s investments in building a more secure and efficient checkout experience. After launching Checkout Extensibility, an all-new checkout customization option for merchants, the company has received favorable feedback from merchants, as it can handle higher volumes of transactions seamlessly.\n\nIs Shopify a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWith Shopify stock registering stellar gains in the last 12 months, some analysts have turned cautious in the last couple of months. JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone downgraded Shopify on December 18, citing concerns about the company’s potential to improve gross margins in the coming years at a time when the bulk of GMV growth is expected to come from its Enterprise business. The analyst believes the current valuation of the company leaves little room for error.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Scott Devitt also downgraded Shopify last month after raising his price target to $68 from $66, citing limited room for its earnings multiple to expand and the absence of a catalyst to drive the stock price higher. Before that, Piper Sandler analyst Clarke Jeffries downgraded Shopify in November, citing valuation concerns.\n\nBased on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, SHOP stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. The average Shopify stock price target is $76.10, which implies downside risk of 5.25% from the current market price.\n\nThe Takeaway: Shopify is Perfectly Priced\n\nShopify is trying to strike a balance between growth and profitability, which is encouraging. The company’s recent financial performance, on the other hand, serves as a testament to the successful execution of its cost-reduction strategy. Even more encouragingly, the company continues to focus on strategic investments to drive future growth. All that said, Shopify seems to be valued fairly in the market, which leaves no margin of safety to invest in the company today.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Jeff Bezos, the mastermind behind Amazon.com Inc. and a visionary in space exploration, is often seen as the epitome of success.\n\nBut even someone of Bezos’s stature seeks inspiration to navigate the complexities and solitude that accompany being at the zenith of global business. In 2018, Bezos offered the world a rare glimpse into what fuels his motivation and perspective on success through a simple post on X.\n\nBezos is not just a figure of corporate prowess but also a seeker of wisdom. This was illustrated when he posted a photo of a quote that has been on his fridge for years, influencing him every time he opens the door. “Love this quote. It's been on my fridge for years, and I see it every time I open the door. #Emerson,” Bezos wrote in the post. The quote, attributed to philosopher and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, encapsulates what it means to succeed in life.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAirbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market. Funders on this alternative asset platform are earning more than 14% annualized consignment profit funding Pro consignment opportunities.\n\nThe quote reads: \"To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.”\n\nThe excerpt offers a multifaceted definition of success, transcending material achievements and delving into the realms of emotional fulfillment, moral integrity and societal contribution.\n\nBezos’s choice of this quote as a mantra is revealing. It suggests that his understanding of success is not confined to Amazon's growth or his space endeavors. Instead, it points to a broader, more holistic view of achievement — one that values laughter, respect, affection, appreciation and leaving a positive imprint on the world. It’s a reminder that success is about enriching lives, including your own, through acts of kindness, appreciation and human connection.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe quote is a testament to Bezos’s recognition of the more human aspects of success. It’s a philosophy that underscores the importance of not just achieving but doing so with a sense of purpose and humanity. As Bezos continues to shape the future through his ventures, the quote on his fridge is a reminder of the values that guide him beyond the boardroom and into the realm of lasting, meaningful impact.\n\nAmazon’s evolution from a garage startup to a trillion-dollar corporation is a testament to the potential for innovation and growth in the startup ecosystem. Bezos's journey inspires entrepreneurs and investors to believe in the transformative power of their ideas and initiatives. It highlights that anyone can invest in startups, offering people the opportunity to participate from the ground level. Amazon’s success story is a testament to the belief that achievements can emerge from the most humble beginnings.\n\nRead Next:\n\nFor decades, Wall Street has been synonymous with the financial world.

        "title": "Amazon Makes Local Sports Deal, Giving Broadcaster New Life",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Diamond Sports Group reached a restructuring deal with most of its debt holders and Amazon.com Inc. that will save the bankrupt local sports broadcaster from liquidation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Milei’s Younger Sister Is Also ‘The Boss’ Directing His Mission\n\nThe deal, subject to bankruptcy court approval, calls for Diamond to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings with beefed-up finances and Amazon’s Prime Video platform as its main streaming partner, according to a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe company — a unit of Sinclair Inc. — was in the midst of finalizing a plan to wind down after the 2024 sports seasons when talks with Amazon about a streaming deal began late last year. Now, key creditors have agreed to swap their holdings for stock in Diamond and put in new money, while Amazon also agreed to make a minority investment in the company, according to the statement.\n\nThe deal will allow sports fans to purchase access to local Diamond channels through Amazon’s Prime Video platform and watch live MLB, NBA and NHL games for the sports teams where Diamond holds so-called direct-to-consumer rights. Diamond will also look for a new naming rights arrangement for its channels, which currently use the name Bally Sports, according to company filings.\n\nSome creditors agreed to provide $450 million of new financing, with the proceeds used to repay $350 million to senior debt holders and support continuing operations, according to the statement. Consenting lenders include more than 85% of the first-lien debt holders, as well as more than half of second-lien creditors and around two-thirds of unsecured bondholders. Amazon’s investment would come in the form of debt that it can convert to equity, according to company filings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower ranking creditors are skeptical about the new, proposed bankruptcy loan that would help fund the case for the next few months, said Scott L. Alberino, a lawyer for the official committee of unsecured creditors. That loan contains huge fees that will benefit senior lenders at the expense of unsecured creditors, Alberino said.\n\nOfficials at Major League Baseball were caught off-guard by the proposed deal, MLB bankruptcy attorney James Bromley said during a court hearing held by video on Wednesday. Baseball officials will review the proposal before deciding whether to drop their objections to the bankruptcy case.\n\nThe Amazon deal was “a complete shock,” Bromley said. The league needs more time because Diamond is proposing to radically alter the way it does business with MLB and its clubs, he said.\n\n“There’s a lot to digest,” Bromley said.\n\nThe broadcaster filed for bankruptcy in March of last year, marking a swift collapse for a company bought from Walt Disney Co. for $9.6 billion in 2019. US regional sports networks have been under increasing financial pressure as more people cancel their cable-TV service.\n\nDiamond’s restructuring plan includes a tentative deal to settle outstanding litigation with its parent company, Sinclair.\n\nDiamond had accused Sinclair of wrongly siphoning more than $1.5 billion from the local broadcaster before its bankruptcy. The settlement calls for Sinclair to pay Diamond $495 million in cash and provide ongoing management and transition services, according to the statement.\n\n--With assistance from Steven Church and Jonathan Randles.\n\n(Adds detail from hearing beginning in sixth paragraph.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nOn January 17, financial markets experienced a significant downturn, marking the worst day in a month for stocks, primarily driven by a surge in bond yields. Accrdoing to Bloomberg, this development has raised speculations that the Federal Reserve may not be quick to implement interest rate cuts, given the apparent resilience of the economy. The likelihood of a March interest-rate cut, as indicated by Fed swaps, has now been trimmed to approximately 50%, reflecting a shift in market expectations. The surge in US retail sales, reported as the highest in three months, further intensified concerns among investors. The robust reading on retail sales triggered apprehensions about the efficacy of Wall Street's assertive dovish stance, especially in the context of favorable economic data. Central bank officials, adopting a more cautious tone regarding potential easing measures, added to the apprehension among traders. This cautious stance has created an environment where market participants are now readjusting their expectations, delaying the anticipated timing of the first Fed move. As a result, the odds of a rate reduction in the first quarter have been revised downward. The comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde underscore the concerns about aggressive market bets on interest-rate cuts. Lagarde emphasized that such speculative behavior in financial markets may not be conducive to policymakers' efforts and their ability to effectively manage economic challenges.\n\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has commanded considerable attention at the World Economic Forum, drawing interest from major tech players like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google. In 2024, the spotlight has shifted to a more nuanced exploration of generative AI, with a specific emphasis on advancing the accuracy of AI results. This evolution is deemed critical for fostering confidence, particularly in high-stakes industries such as healthcare and manufacturing. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has emerged as a key advocate for this refinement, asserting that the next phase of AI development involves incorporating formal correctness into the underlying models. In an interview with CNBC, Gelsinger underscores the need for precision, especially in domains like medicine, manufacturing, and autonomous driving, where accuracy is paramount. Interviews with Gelsinger and Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, reveal a shared commitment to experimentation and co-piloting tests as instrumental strategies for improving accuracy and encouraging wider adoption of AI technologies. Shih introduces a pragmatic three-phase approach for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) adoption, which begins with assisting work, progresses to ensuring accuracy in autopilot mode, and ultimately leads to trusting the technology at chosen confidence levels. This phased approach aligns with the broader goal of making AGI more approachable and less intimidating, emphasizing the crucial role of human acceptance. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, contributes insights during panel discussions, characterizing AGI as a potent tool rather than a disruptive force replacing jobs. Altman underscores the collaborative potential of AI, describing it as an enhancer of productivity that amplifies human capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq, reflects on the past year as a transformative period for AI, describing it as a time of discovery. The financial industry, including Nasdaq, is gearing up for an \"activation\" phase, leveraging AI to update outdated code and modernize aging systems. The anticipated outcome is significant improvements in automated workflows, leading to substantial time savings for employees. The discussions at Davos underscore the pivotal role of generative AI in shaping the technological landscape. The current focus on accuracy, trust-building, and practical applications across diverse industries signals a transformative shift, emphasizing the collaborative potential of AI as a tool for enhancing productivity and human capabilities.\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets. Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\n10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nAs of January 16, Barclays analyst Ryan Macwilliams has opted to uphold his Equal-Weight rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), while concurrently revising the price target upward from $32 to $44. This adjustment in the price target indicates an optimistic outlook for the stock's performance in the foreseeable future. It is important to note that the industry context for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is crucial in understanding these recommendations. In the dynamic landscape of the technology sector, Intel, as a prominent player in the semiconductor industry, is subject to various market forces and trends. The Equal-Weight rating implies that the analyst perceives Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) performance to be in line with the broader market, neither overweight nor underweight. This nuanced stance suggests a balanced perspective, taking into consideration both the company's strengths and potential challenges. The decision to raise the price target to $44 signifies increased confidence in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) ability to deliver positive returns to investors.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\n09. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)\n\nUpside Potential: 2%\n\nAs of January 16, Barclays has adjusted its outlook on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), a key player in the consumer goods industry. Specifically, Barclays has raised the company's price target from $75 to $82, reflecting a moderate upside potential of 2% in comparison to its current market price. Despite this upward revision, Barclays maintains an Equal Weight rating on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) shares. This strategic move by Barclays suggests a cautious yet optimistic stance on the company's performance. The Equal Weight rating implies that, according to Barclays analysts, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is expected to perform in line with industry peers, neither overweight nor underweight. Investors may interpret this rating as an indication of balanced expectations for the stock's future performance. The increase in the price target to $82 underscores Barclays' confidence in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) ability to generate positive returns for investors. The 2% upside potential suggests a measured optimism, taking into account various factors such as market conditions, company fundamentals, and potential catalysts within the consumer goods sector.\n\nSimilar to the optimistic sentiments expressed by analysts towards Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), they are favorable about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL).\n\n08. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nUpside Potential: 10%\n\nAs of January 16, Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman has made notable adjustments to the outlook for The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), a prominent player in the beverage industry. Specifically, Lieberman has increased the company's price target by 10%, elevating it from $60 to $66. Importantly, this modification reflects a substantial upside potential of 10% in comparison to its current market price. Concurrently, Barclays has maintained an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares. The decision to raise the price target to $66 indicates a heightened level of confidence in Coca-Cola's future performance, as perceived by Barclays. This optimistic adjustment may be underpinned by factors such as anticipated improvements in financial metrics, strategic initiatives, or positive trends within the beverage industry. The Overweight rating reaffirms Barclays' belief that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is poised to outperform its industry peers. This rating suggests a favorable view of the stock's potential for delivering strong returns relative to the broader market. Investors may interpret this as a signal to consider The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) as an attractive investment opportunity within the beverage sector.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”\n\n07. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)\n\nUpside Potential: 11%\n\nAs of January 16, Piper Sandler has revised its assessment of Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), a prominent player in the home improvement retail industry. Specifically, Piper Sandler has increased the target price for Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) from $218.00 to $245.00, signaling a substantial upside potential of 11%. This adjustment is accompanied by Piper Sandler's decision to affirm an \"overweight\" rating for the stock. The heightened target price of $245.00 reflects Piper Sandler's optimistic outlook on Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), suggesting a strong belief in the company's potential for future growth. This positive adjustment may be driven by factors such as anticipated improvements in financial performance, strategic initiatives, or favorable trends within the home improvement retail sector. The \"overweight\" rating underscores Piper Sandler's conviction that Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is well-positioned to outperform its industry peers. This rating implies a favorable view of the stock's potential to deliver robust returns compared to the broader market. Investors may interpret this rating as a signal to consider Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) as an attractive investment opportunity within the home improvement retail landscape.\n\nLowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is garnering bullish outlooks from analysts, much like the positive sentiments observed for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).\n\nMadison Investors Fund made the following comment about Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The bottom five individual contributors were Dollar Tree, Fiserv, Analog Devices, Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), and Alcon. Both Analog Devices and Lowe’s Companies saw end-market demand moderate (in semiconductors and home improvement products, respectively) relative to the strong levels over the last couple of years. Despite these near-term trends, we remain very confident in the long-term trends within both markets.”\n\n06. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nUpside Potential: 15%\n\nAs of January 16, BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham has made significant adjustments to the outlook for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), a major player in the financial services industry. Specifically, Fotheringham has increased the firm's price target from $192 to $194, signaling a noteworthy upside potential of 15%. However, it's important to note that despite the upward revision in the price target, BMO Capital has maintained a Market Perform rating on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The decision to raise the price target to $194 suggests an optimistic perspective on JPMorgan's future performance, indicating confidence in the potential for significant appreciation in its stock value. This positive adjustment may be attributed to factors such as anticipated improvements in financial metrics, strategic initiatives, or positive trends within the financial services sector. The Market Perform rating from BMO Capital implies a neutral stance on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), suggesting that the stock is expected to perform in line with the broader market. While there is acknowledgment of the potential for upside, the rating indicates a measured view on the stock's relative performance compared to its industry peers.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Vltava Fund stated the following regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM):\n\n“Last spring, the US went through a brief banking crisis that cost several smaller and medium-sized banks their lives. One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations. That is why we hold JPM.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable 16 Most Profitable Small-Cap Stocks Now 30 Most Profitable Businesses You Can Start in USA\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "2 Industrial REITs to Buy for Income in 2024",
        "content": "Industrial real estate investment trusts (REITs) own and manage income-generating industrial properties, such as warehouses, distribution centers, logistics facilities, and manufacturing plants. Industrial REITs generate income by leasing the properties.\n\nInvestors in industrial REITs can benefit from the demand for space in the logistics and manufacturing sectors. The growth of e-commerce and the need for efficient supply chain management have contributed to the growth of the space in recent years. Similar to other REITs, industrial REITs are required to distribute a significant portion of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends.\n\nPrologis\n\nPrologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is one of the world's largest owners, developers, and managers of industrial properties, including distribution facilities, logistics centers, and warehouses, with ownership interests in approximately 1.2 billion square feet across the globe. Its largest clients include industry giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and UPS (NYSE:UPS).\n\nPrologis currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.87 per share, equating to $3.48 per share annually, which gives it a yield of about 2.7% today. The company has also raised its annual dividend for 10 consecutive years, making it a great play for both dividend income and dividend growth.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nStag Industrial\n\nStag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) owns and operates 568 industrial properties in 41 states containing 112 million square feet as of September 30, 2023. Like Prologis, Stag counts Amazon and FedEx as two of its largest clients, along with XPO (NYSE:XPO) and WestRock (NYSE:WR).\n\nStory continues\n\nStag pays a monthly dividend of $0.123333 per share, equating to about $1.48 per share annually, which gives it a yield of about 3.9% today. In addition to being a monthly income stock, Stag has raised its annual dividend every year since its 2011 initial public offering, making it qualify as a dividend-growth play as well.\n\nAnother way to invest in industrial properties\n\nCommercial real estate, including industrial, has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000. If public REITs don't interest you, then maybe this will.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is continuously bolstering its Google TV capabilities with new feature updates to capitalize on the growth opportunities present in the global smart streaming devices market. Per a Statista report, the global smart streaming devices market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.7% during the forecast period of 2023-2030.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company announced the availability of a new audio switcher for Google TV in the upcoming months.\r\n\r\nThis new feature, set to be present in Google TV's Quick Settings option, will enable users to switch between Bluetooth headphones and TV speakers without navigating to the full Settings menu.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid traction across smart TV users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nMore on Google TV\n\nApart from the latest announcement, Google introduced a new \"Call notifications\" option on Google TV, enabling select apps to send calls to the TV and allowing users to toggle on and off this feature in the Settings app.\r\n\r\nAlphabet expanded its Google TV content portfolio by adding a slew of apps and services like ABC, Amazon’s AMZN Prime Video, Apple’s AAPL Apple TV+, AMC and Kocowa, among others.\r\n\r\nAlso, the company extended its Google TV services to several other regions, including Brazil, France, Germany and Japan, among others.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will strengthen the company’s Google TV offerings. This, in turn, is expected to aid the Google Services segment’s performance, which has been a key growth driver for the company. Alphabet shares have gained 56.1% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 45.1%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.7% in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nAlphabet’s growing efforts to boost its Google TV offerings will enable this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to compete well against some notable industry players like Apple, Amazon and Roku ROKU, which are also making concerted efforts to gain a solid footing in the streaming devices market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, Apple revealed a selection of immersive original stories for Apple TV+ using Apple Immersive Video, which will be available in the Apple TV app on Apple Vision Pro on February 2.\r\n\r\nFurther, Apple introduced the Zoom video conferencing app to its Apple TV 4K. The app, known as “Zoom for Home TV,” utilizes iOS' Continuity Camera feature for meetings, offering calendar integration and easy-to-access shortcuts for upcoming meetings on Apple TV.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Amazon is enjoying the growing momentum of its Fire TV line-up.\r\n\r\nAmazon partnered with Panasonic to combine Fire TV's personalized streaming experience and Alexa access with Panasonic's top-of-the-line smart TVs for global customers, boosting its smart streaming device offerings.\r\n\r\nRoku, on the other hand, is expanding its smart streaming device offerings with new feature updates for Roku TV.\r\n\r\nRoku introduced user-friendly features for Roku TV in its 'What to Watch' section, including 'Recommendations,' 'Save Lists' and 'Continue Watching.'

        "title": "5 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is known for his long-term investing style. Today, Legendary investor  -- nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha -- holds dozens of stocks via his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nI've gone through Berkshire's many holdings to determine what makes a stock worth holding forever. After all, forever is a long time! It turns out, though, that there are some clues. For instance, Buffett often tends to favor consumer stocks. You'll notice that they all:\n\nGrow for decades (even if they occasionally hit setbacks). Sell things consumers buy repeatedly. Have colossal market opportunities.\n\nHere are five Buffett stocks you can buy and hold without losing sleep.\n\n1. Apple\n\nNaturally, Berkshire's largest holding kicks this list off. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is 47% of the portfolio. It didn't start that way, but Apple's strong performance since 2016 (when Buffett bought) made it that way, and Buffett has held the shares throughout all the success. The iPhone maker is arguably the world's most prominent company today. Over 2 billion people use iOS devices worldwide. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThat customer base creates tremendous, though sometimes lumpy, revenue and profits as consumers buy new phones or devices and subscribe to various services, like Apple Music, Cloud, and more. Consumers do so much on their phones that it gives Apple additional growth opportunities in new categories like artificial intelligence, telehealth, and fintech in the future.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBuffett isn't always in stocks as early as he should be. After all, nobody is perfect. E-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is an example of Buffett missing the early upside in a big winner. He bought his first shares in 2019, a position that's just 0.4% of Berkshire's holdings.\n\nHowever, there is still a lot to be excited about with Amazon. It's the dominant e-commerce business in America, holding a 38% market share. It's also the world's leading cloud platform, with 32% of that industry.\n\nStory continues AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNot only are e-commerce and cloud computing big markets that can still expand for years, but Amazon is actively setting up new growth opportunities, a mindset instilled by founder Jeff Bezos. Amazon is jumping into media and advertising with both feet. Its Prime membership has over 200 million members and broadcasts entertainment content and live sports via the National Football League on Prime Video. So many irons in the fire make future growth highly likely.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) needs little introduction. It's one of the world's most widely recognized brands and has been a core holding in Berkshire's portfolio since the late 1980s. Today, the stock is Berkshire's fourth-largest holding at 6.7%. It's also a testament to dividend stocks. Berkshire receives a whopping $736 million in dividends from Coca-Cola each year. KO Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCoca-Cola isn't a growth stock, but the business is growing. It's a simple recipe. Take a product portfolio with hundreds of beverage brands sold in virtually every country on Earth. Coca-Cola's products are in stores, vending machines, restaurants -- virtually everywhere they can be.\n\nFactor in slow population growth, new product launches and acquisitions, and price increases, and you get decades of growth and investment returns. It's as simple as that.\n\n4. Diageo\n\nSticking with the beverage industry, Buffett also went to the other side of the aisle, to the alcohol business. Diageo(NYSE: DEO) is a conglomerate that owns several household alcohol brands, including Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Captain Morgan, Baileys, Smirnoff, and more. In all, Diageo is doing over $20 billion in annual sales.\n\nAlcohol falls into a category often called sin stocks. It's not good for you, but people have been drinking to alleviate stress and have a good time for thousands of years. DEO Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's not a massive investment by Buffett's standards. Berkshire allocates just $32 million to Diageo stock, making it a rounding error in Berkshire's portfolio. But if you're looking for a company that's as certain to be around in 100 years as any, Diageo is an outstanding stock to take a look at today.\n\n5. American Express\n\nLastly, Buffett has benefited from how much Americans love spending money. Credit card company American Express(NYSE: AXP) has resided in Berkshire's portfolio since the early 1990s, and it's grown to 7.6%, the portfolio's third-largest holding. Credit cards are a bedrock in consumers' household finances. Credit card debt across America totals more than $1 trillion today. AXP Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThat will not change anytime soon, and American Express should remain a household brand name. During recent earnings calls, the company's management noted that younger generations, like Millennials and Gen Z, are its fastest-growing demographic. As these consumers mature and become the primary spenders in the economy, American Express should continue delivering for shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.077 = US$26b ÷ (US$487b - US$145b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nTherefore, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 7.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Multiline Retail industry average of 10%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Amazon.com's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for Amazon.com.\n\nSo How Is Amazon.com's ROCE Trending?\n\nIn terms of Amazon.com's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 12% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nIn summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Amazon.com is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. Furthermore the stock has climbed 88% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.\n\nIf you're still interested in Amazon.com it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.\n\nWhile Amazon.com isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "On Wall Street zeroes can become heroes relatively quickly. For example, in the past the Street hated Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and now they’re all among the most beloved names in the stock market. Often, positive macro trends can explain the transformation. For example, Roku and Pinterest got a big boost due to the acceleration of advertising spending. Obviously, investors can make a great deal of money by correctly predict which names will go from hated to loved within a year. Here are three contrarian stock picks which I believe are very well-positioned to make the journey in the next 12 months.\n\nBionano (BNGO) Bionano Genomics (BNGO) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nBionano’s (NASDAQ:BNGO) products use a method called optical genome mapping (OGM) to identify structural variations within DNA missed by other methods. OGM is clearly becoming much more popular among healthcare professionals as seen in BNGO’s recent financials. The company reported that its revenue had climbed 27% to 30% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. Moreover, it estimated that the number of flowcells that it had sold had soared 67% year-over-year to nearly 8,000. Flowcells, which are used to facilitate OGM, are the firm’s main source of revenue.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that CEO Erik Holmlin stated in November that the firm had been in contact with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in an effort to obtain the agency’s approval for an OGM test. In order to obtain the approval, the firm will have to conduct a relatively small clinical study this year, the CEO explained.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuch an approval, which sounds as though it could come at the end of this year or in the first half of 2025, would likely result in many insurers covering the test, causing many more labs to utilize it and tremendously lifting BNGO stock.\n\nAs a result, I view BNGO as one of the best contrarian stock picks at this point.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) continues to make progress in its drive to develop a comprehensive, profitable hydrogen ecosystem. On Dec. 27, PLUG announced that it had successfully deployed and launched an electrolyzer system at an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plant in Colorado.\n\nThis is the first time that Amazon has deployed such an electrolyzer which utilizes electricity and water to produce hydrogen which is used to power hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklift trucks. I’m optimistic that Amazon will utilize PLUG’s electrolyzers at dozens more of its plants over the next year. If that prediction comes true it would meaningfully lift PLUG’s top and bottom lines.\n\nFurther, the huge freight-train company, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), is utilizing PLUG’s hydrogen fuel-cell power generators. Specifically, the company had deployed 67 of these generators as of Dec 27. I’m confident that many other sizeable firms will utilize large numbers of PLUG’s generators over the longer term, giving PLUG stock a meaningful lift.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite the media’s hand wringing about the lack of growth of electric vehicles in America, EVs are actually continuing to proliferate fairly rapidly in the U.S. Last quarter, 8% of all the vehicles sold in the country were EVs. That represented a 40% increase versus the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, Bloombergpredicts that nearly 1.9 million EVs will be provided to customers this year, up from almost 1.2 million in 2023.\n\nThat growth should tremendously benefit EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) which has one of the largest networks of fast EV chargers in the country.\n\nAnd that network is in a position to greatly increase in 2024, as EVgo, in partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Warren Buffet-owned convenience store operator Pilot, intends to add roughly 200 charging stations this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in BNGO,PLUG, and EVGO.

        "content": "Many stocks had incredible runs in 2023, and not just the so called “Magnificent 7” mega-cap technology concerns. While underreported, many stocks beat the performance of the Magnificent 7 last year. Further, they saw their share prices completely recover from the downturn in 2022. Best of all, these market outperformers look likely to continue running hot. This year and beyond, they are fueled by strong earnings, growing market share, and beneficial partnerships.\n\nFor investors wanting to grow their portfolios, these stocks present a great opportunity. Few other stocks have grown as quickly or have as much potential to continue compounding gains. Let’s explore a fast-track to fortune with three stocks to buy to build wealth fast.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) DKNG stock: DraftKings app, DraftKings layoffs\n\nEver since it established itself as the market leader in sports betting, shares of DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) have been ripping higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the last 12 months, DKNG stock has gained 133%, increasing to 236% since the company’s 2019 initial public offering (IPO). The stock’s strong performance has been underpinned by solid financial results. And the company’s growing share of the lucrative North American sports betting market is forecast to reach $12 billion in 2024.\n\nRecently, DraftKings announced a 57% year-over-year (YOY) increase in Q3 revenue as its customer base grows. The unprofitable company reported a loss of 61 cents per share, which was better than the expected loss of 69 cents a share. Revenue in the quarter totaled $790 million versus the forecast of $706.8 million. DKNG reported 2.3 million monthly unique payers in Q3, a 40% YOY increase. Average revenue per bettor increased 14% to $114, the company said.\n\nCurrently, DraftKings is live with mobile sports betting in 22 U.S. states, with a betting presence in Canada. DKNG is planning to expand into Maine and North Carolina this year, pending regulatory approval. Last fall, DraftKings overtook rival sportsbook FanDuel to become the leader in the U.S. online gambling market with a 31% share.\n\nStory continues\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloud service provider Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is another stock that has been on fire over the past year. DDOG rose 28% in a single trading session last fall after the company reported better-than-expected Q3 results and raised its guidance.\n\nFor all of 2023, Datadog’s share price doubled, bringing its return since its 2019 IPO to 240%. Founded in 2010, Datadog builds cloud monitoring and security products. Top clients include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nRecently, the company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents, beating expectations for 34 cents. Revenue amounted to $547.5 million, up 25% YOY and beating Wall Street forecasts that called for $524.1 million in sales. Also, Datadog lifted its guidance, saying it now expects Q4 revenue of $564 million to $568 million, and full-year revenue of $2.1 billion. Both figures exceeded consensus forecasts among analysts.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a rough 2022 bear market, shares of Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) staged a monster rally last year. They rose 455% during the course of 2023, outpacing nearly every other stock.\n\nWhile AFRM has pulled back to begin 2024, it likely won’t be long before the share price is again running higher. The company’s share price rose 15% in one day right before these past holidays. News revealed its buy now pay later (BNPL) option will be added to self-checkout kiosks at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stores.\n\nSpecifically, Affirm said that it will offer BNPL services that allow consumers to pay off purchases in installments at more than 4,500 Walmart locations. Also, consumers can choose Affirm’s BNPL option when shopping on Walmart’s website. Over the last year, Affirm has established partnerships with other major online retailers and e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in MSFT.

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.37% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.62%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.19%.\n\nShares of the online retailer witnessed a gain of 0.36% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its gain of 1.56% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.56%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Amazon will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.79, up 276.19% from the prior-year quarter. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $166.12 billion, showing a 11.34% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.14.\n\nInvestors should also note that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.49 right now. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory.

        "title": "Tech layoffs continue after 'Year of Efficiency'",
        "content": "By Aditya Soni and Chavi Mehta\n\nJan 16 (Reuters) - Big Tech's \"Year of Efficiency\" may be over but recent layoffs at Google and Amazon have signaled the firms will keep cutting jobs in 2024 as they make big investments in generative AI.\n\nAnalysts and industry experts believe the layoffs would be smaller and more targeted this year, with firms that are racing to catch up in the AI race more likely to make such moves to offset the billions of dollars they are spending on the tech.\n\nAlphabet suggested that last week, saying it plans to invest in its \"biggest priorities\" as the Google parent laid off around a thousand employees across multiple divisions, including in its voice assistant unit and team responsible for Pixel and Fitbit.\n\nEven its advertising business was not spared, with a report on Tuesday saying that hundreds of jobs were being cut at the unit.\n\nAmazon.com laid off several hundred employees in its streaming and studio operations last week. Hundreds of jobs were also cut in its Twitch live-streaming platform and Audible audiobook unit, according to media reports.\n\nOverall, tech firms have let go more than 7,500 employees so far in January, according to tracking website Layoffs.fyi.\n\n\"No company wants to get left behind by the AI revolution and they are all making sure they have these capabilities and are prioritizing them, even when it is at the expense of other initiatives,\" D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said.\n\nBoth Google and Amazon are aggressively investing in their AI efforts. Google, which is trying to close the gap with Microsoft in the AI race, last month unveiled its long-awaited Gemini model, while Amazon is developing a model codenamed \"Olympus\" to compete with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's GPT-4 model.\n\nHIRING PRIORITIES\n\nStill, the total size of the layoffs is expected to be much smaller, compared with last year's massive cuts, as tech spending picks up on the back of a more stable economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech sector shed 168,032 jobs in 2023 and accounted for the highest number of layoffs across industries, according to a report by Challenger, Gray and Christmas earlier this month.\n\nThose were led by tens of thousands of cuts at tech giants including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg termed 2023 as the \"Year of Efficiency\".\n\n\"I don't think there will be a similar reckoning. (Last year) tech firms were shedding all these employees they hired during the pandemic,\" said GlobalData analyst Beatriz Valle.\n\n\"AI is driving a lot of dynamism but this only means that tech companies will be changing their hiring priorities.\"\n\nSome tech firms have been offering hefty salaries for AI roles, with a report saying last year that Match's Hinge dating app was looking for a vice president of AI with a base salary of up to $398,000 a year and that Amazon was offering a top salary of $340,300 for a senior manager of applied science and genAI.\n\nThe spending is expected to deepen investor expectations on the returns from genAI, but the payoff for most companies could take longer to play out, according to analysts and experts.\n\nSo far, only Microsoft and chip giant Nvidia have emerged as big winners from the boom.\n\nDaniel Keum, an assistant professor of management at the Columbia Business School, said past evidence shows it can take a decade or more to profitably make money from new technologies.\n\n\"The question is 'is it different this time for AI?' I am pessimistic, but many smart people believe it will be much shorter this time,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni, Chavi Mehta, Jaspreet Singh and Samrhitha A in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

        "title": "If You'd Invest $350,000 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends",
        "content": "A group of technology giants dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" was responsible for a large proportion of the 26.3% gain in the S&P 500 last year. That's because their collective valuation of $12 trillion makes up 28% of the index, so they have a huge influence over the direction of the broader market.\n\nThese are the Magnificent Seven stocks, and how they performed in 2023: NVDA Total Return Price Chart\n\nThe Equal Weight S&P 500 index -- which assigns an identical weighting to all 500 stocks -- finished 2023 with a gain of just 11.5%. It highlights just how impactful the surging Magnificent Seven returns were on the actual S&P 500. If you didn't own that group of stocks last year, your portfolio probably lagged the market.\n\nBut it's not all about blockbuster gains, because some of the Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. I'm going to show you how much you could earn with a $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence, cloud computing, electric vehicles, and more\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies operate across every major segment of the technology sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the largest driver of value in 2023, which is why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the group higher. Its H100 and upcoming H200 data center chips are designed to process AI workloads, and demand continues to surge as more businesses seek to develop AI applications.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are some of the world's largest data center operators, and therefore some of Nvidia's biggest customers. They use those centralized data centers to deliver cloud services -- and the computing power necessary to develop AI -- to millions of businesses around the world. Plus, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet offer cloud customers a growing number of large language models (LLMs), which are the building blocks of many AI applications.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using AI to show more relevant content to each of its 3.1 billion monthly users. The company also created an LLM of its own called Llama, which is open source, so any developer can use it to build advanced AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) created its own LLM in-house, which it's using to develop an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT. It will pair nicely with the company's latest iPhone 15, because it's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads on-device. This will place AI at the fingertips of billions of people around the world.\n\nFinally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the world's leading electric vehicle company by sales up until the end of 2023, when it was edged out by China-based BYD. However, Tesla's future will likely be determined by the success of its AI-powered autonomous self-driving vehicle technology. It's yet to be publicly released, but it has the potential to transform the company's economics. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThree of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay dividends\n\nSome companies generate so much profit they can't possibly reinvest it all into their operations to fuel more growth, so they pay some of it to shareholders instead. Dividends are the most common form of distribution, and they usually come as quarterly cash payments.\n\nApple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that pay dividends. Each of them less than a 1% yield, which are the payouts investors can expect to receive annually, calculated based on the value of their holdings. MSFT Dividend Yield Chart\n\nYields often change. If a stock doubles, its yield will halve organically unless the company raises its dividend. It doesn't mean the payout shrinks in dollar terms, but it falls as a percentage of the value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers the highest yield, and while it seems small at face value, it translates to around $20 billion in dividend payments each year based on its current market capitalization of $2.8 trillion.\n\nIf you'd invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock) you would earn a dividend yield of 0.37% on $150,000, and no yield on the other $200,000. That translates to an effective yield of 0.18% on the $350,000, or an annual payment of $659.56.\n\nIt's a paltry sum given the yield investors can earn on cash in a savings account right now, but it's a nice bonus on top of the spectacular capital growth these stocks have delivered over the past year.\n\nDividends aren't the only form of distribution\n\nA dividend isn't the only way companies return money to shareholders. They can also execute stock buyback programs, where they purchase their own shares on the open market. Those shrink the number of available shares in circulation, which leads to a higher price per share.\n\nStock buybacks are preferable to dividends for many companies, because they give them the flexibility to distribute the money at a time of their choosing -- they aren't locked into paying out a specified sum each quarter.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven companies have active share repurchase programs, worth a combined $186.6 billion over the last 12 months. Tesla and Amazon are the two without active programs. AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nAre the Magnificent Seven stocks still a buy now?\n\nAs I touched on at the top, investors who didn't own the Magnificent Seven stocks in 2023 likely underperformed the S&P 500 index. The law of large numbers makes it somewhat counterintuitive to expect these enormous companies to continue delivering the best returns in the entire market, because it gets harder for them to grow their revenue and earnings each year.\n\nHowever, it so happens that the Magnificent Seven companies operate at the forefront of the fastest growing industries in the world. For any investor seeking exposure to technologies like AI, cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, or electric vehicles, it's nearly impossible to look past these stocks.\n\nDepending on which Wall Street forecast you rely on, AI alone could add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade. Each of the Magnificent Seven already has a foothold in the industry, and they will likely deploy their considerable financial resources to ensure they capture a large slice of the opportunity.\n\nTherefore, the Magnificent Seven will likely be a great place for investors to park their money for the long term, and any dividends earned are an added bonus.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "New trends can be exciting for investors but don't always live up to the hype. Consider blockchain technology, which has lost its hold on the market. Omnichannel shopping, on the other hand, remains an integral part of successful retail.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the newest trend driving investor interest. It's been around for years, but generative AI is a newer technology that's making waves because of its human-like ability to generate ideas and content. Many of today's most popular stocks either contribute to the creation of generative AI or offer these services to clients.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is in both categories. It's at the forefront of developing large learning models (LLMS) that create high-level generative AI and also offers many tools based on these LLMs to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud services clients. It also uses AI across its business in many segments.\n\nAmazon has minted plenty of millionaires since going public almost 30 years ago but remains a leader in innovation and technology. Owning Amazon stock in your portfolio can help on your path toward millionaire status.\n\nAI in AWS\n\nAmazon made a splash when it announced its new generative AI services for AWS last year. It now offers several AI tools to enhance AWS businesses, such as SageMaker and Code Whisperer.\n\nCustomers can customize Amazon's machine learning model or create their own with the company's foundation models. Amazon Bedrock lets users develop their own machine-learning models based on their data, and Code Whisperer lets developers insert prompts to create AI-generated code.\n\nAWS' AI tools can build chatbots and virtual agents, find accurate information faster, customize applications for individual users, implement voice recognition, and more. For business operations, they can create forecasting models, detect data anomalies, and find code vulnerabilities more quickly.\n\nManagement said that it uses AWS' predictive capabilities in streaming Thursday Night Football. It can help determine which players are in positions to convert a first down or are likely to rush the quarterback.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther companies are launching their own competitive services, but Amazon is the largest cloud computing company, by far, with 32% of the market, according to Statista. Sales growth decelerated to 12% in the 2023 third quarter, but management said it's starting the see negative trends reverse and expecting higher momentum for AWS in the coming quarters. The company announced expanded partnerships with companies like BMW and Occidental Petroleum in the third quarter.\n\nAI in e-commerce\n\nAmazon uses AI throughout its e-commerce business to identify trends, manage inventory, and for product recommendations. The company has an extensive distribution network, with eight regional warehouses and multiple lines and delivery methods. It uses AI to determine the fastest and cheapest way to get out orders.\n\nThe company also offers generative AI tools to third-party merchants to create images, descriptions, and campaigns with prompts.\n\nAI in advertising\n\nAmazon offers similar services to advertisers so they can benefit from the company's large audience and data stores.\n\nThere's no better place than Amazon, with its years of machine learning and data points, to target shoppers who are already looking for what advertisers are providing. It also gives advertisers generative AI tools to create lifestyle images with just a picture and a prompt.\n\nAI in smart devices\n\nAI has always powered Amazon's smart home devices like Alexa and the Fire series. It has upgraded the technology to be able to figure out and meet more ambiguous requests and react to more natural conversation, instead of picking up specific phrases.\n\nThere's a lot more to come\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said he thinks the AI opportunity will \"be tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AWS over the next several years.\" AWS typically accounts for an outsized portion of Amazon's income. As its growth accelerates again, it should lead to higher profitability.\n\nAmazon's stock price usually aligns with its income, and as AI leads to higher sales and income, the company's stock should gain.

        "title": "The Once High-Flying Stock-Split Stock to Avoid Like the Plague in 2024",
        "content": "Investing on Wall Street has been akin to riding a roller coaster since this decade began. Over the past four years, the major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.\n\nWhen volatility rules the roost on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to pile into time-tested outperformers. While the FAANG stocks have certainly fit the bill for the past decade, it's companies enacting stock splits that have been investors' preference over the past couple of years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude, without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Stock splits can be used to make shares of a company more nominally affordable for everyday investors (a forward-stock split), or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (a reverse-stock split).\n\nInvestors have flocked to high-profile stock-split stocks for more than two years\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, nine high-flying companies have conducted forward-stock splits, including semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), internet search behemoth Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and e-commerce kingpin Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which effected respective splits of 4-for-1, 20-for-1, and 20-for-1.\n\nAlthough the act of splitting their respective shares is a very short-term catalyst driven by investor emotions, forward-stock splits more importantly act as a beacon for businesses that are out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nFor example, Nvidia has gone on to become the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution since conducting its split in July 2021. The company's A100 and H100 AI-inspired graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a greater than 90% share of GPUs in use by high-compute data centers this year. While Nvidia's stock would probably be soaring with or without its stock split in July 2021, its previous split has made shares more affordable for investors without access to fractional-share purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock splits have also served as a reminder of just how impressive Alphabet's and Amazon's respective moats are. Alphabet's Google tallied a nearly 92% share of global internet search in December, which is 88 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor. Google Cloud has also gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure services spending.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon brought in approximately 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022, per Insider Intelligence, and it's the leading provider of global cloud infrastructure services via Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS sports an annual sales run rate of $92 billion and is currently responsible for the lion's share of Amazon's operating income.\n\nLong story short, it's very easy to see why investors have flocked to high-profile stock-split stocks in recent years. Just keep in mind that not all stock-split stocks are worth investing in. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis ultra-popular stock-split stock is worth avoiding in 2024\n\nWhereas forward-stock splits are almost always conducted by top-notch companies, reverse-stock splits are, more often than not, a sign of trouble. Though there have been a few instances throughout history of reverse-stock splits working out nicely for long-term investors, such as tech-based travel company Booking Holdings, reverse splits are usually situations to avoid.\n\nFor once-high-flying marijuana stock Canopy Growth(NASDAQ: CGC), its recent split is all the more reason to keep your distance in 2024. Effective Dec. 20, 2023, the company completed a 1-for-10 reverse split. Had this split not taken place, Canopy's common stock would be trading for about $0.45 per share, which is more than 99% below its all-time high.\n\nAt one time, the Canadian pot industry appeared primed for success. When our neighbors to the north gave recreational weed the green light to be legally sold in October 2018, it was widely expected that vertically integrated licensed producers would thrive. In particular, Canopy Growth was expected to benefit from international exports and a domestic surge in demand for higher-margin cannabis derivatives (e.g., edibles, beverages, and vapes).\n\nUnfortunately, reality never came close to matching these expectations. Part of the blame does lie with Canadian regulators. Federal regulators were incredibly slow to approve cultivation licenses prior to October 2018, while provincial regulators in Ontario (Canada's largest province by population) initially relied on a lottery system to award dispensary licenses. This lottery system resulted in far too few retail locations opening in a key province.\n\nConsumer behavior didn't quite align with projections for Canadian cannabis companies, either. Cannabis users have gravitated toward value-based products and dried cannabis flower. In other words, margins for Canadian licensed producers are far below what was expected.\n\nBut let's not beat around the cannabis bush -- Canopy Growth deserves more than its fair share of the blame, too. Management grossly overestimated domestic and global production needs, which is one reason the company took a goodwill impairment charge of more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2023).\n\nFurthermore, during the early stages of the marijuana craze, Canopy Growth's stock-based compensation was exorbitantly high. Even after hiring David Klein in 2020 from Constellation Brands to tighten Canopy Growth's proverbial belt, the company still hasn't been able to back its way into the profit column. CGC Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nA history of poor acquisitions, coupled with grossly overexpanding production capacity without understanding consumer demand trends, has decimated the company's once-robust cash pile. Since closing a roughly $4 billion equity investment from Constellation Brands in November 2018, Canopy Growth's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments have shrunk to around $201 million, as of Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nAlthough Canopy Growth has raised some cash by issuing stock and conducting private placements, the company's auditors have included a going concern warning in its operating results. This means Canopy may not have the capital to cover its expected operating liabilities over the next 12 months.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for Canopy Growth is that there's no guarantee the U.S. federal government will change marijuana's scheduling anytime soon.

        "content": "Step aside, CFOs: New generative AI technology stands to supplant you as your CEO's best friend.\n\nThis in part reflects how the latest crop of powerful tech can unlock major impact to worker productivity and corporate financials, according to a new study of CEOs by consultancy PwC. The survey was released ahead of an AI-themed World Economic Forum kicking off on Tuesday in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nAbout 68% of US CEOs surveyed say that the next 12 months will see generative AI increasing the amount of work that employees can accomplish. That number is 64% globally, according to PwC. Roughly half of US CEOs expect the technology to help them become more productive in their own work.\n\nThe productivity boost should serve up a jolt to profits, CEOs contend.\n\nNearly 44% of the CEOs questioned say they see generative AI providing a net increase in profits in the next 12 months, versus just 3% anticipating a net decrease.\n\n\"Investors are also increasingly demanding executives pursue profitable growth, prompting many CEOs to turn not only to cost containment strategies, but also to GenAI,\" explained PwC. \"What’s alluring about GenAI is its dual ability to produce efficiency gains that hold down current expenses while simultaneously enabling company reinvention. This may mean that, when the macroeconomic headwinds abate, the stage is set for a potentially faster rate of growth on a lower cost basis.\"\n\nPwC adds that 2024 is shaping up to be the year of \"business model reinvention.\"\n\nPrior research from PwC puts a bow on the broader generative AI economic impact.\n\nAI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined.\n\nThe greatest economic gains from generative AI, says PwC, will be in China (an approximate 26% boost to GDP in 2030) and North America (a roughly 14.5% GDP jolt).\n\nTo be sure, investors have been positioning to capture any major upside in profit increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock indexes such as the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) continue to hover around record highs in 2024. Large-cap tech companies with outsized AI exposure such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon remain top picks amongst Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnd the share price of generative AI chip giant — and market darling — Nvidia has pushed to fresh records in 2024's early going.\n\nIn total, Wall Street currently expects S&P 500 profits to grow an impressive 11% in 2024 as new AI tools proliferate and inflation cools. Last year, S&P 500 profits grew about 3% as companies invested aggressively in the first tranche of generative AI and dealt with lingering inflation.\n\n\"The potential rewards from large and transformative impacts of GenAI still outweigh the rising investor expectations implied by solid CY23 stock performance,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance. \"On the balance, we are just getting started.\" Davos 2024\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Microsoft sets price for premium version of Copilot AI software for consumers at $20 per user",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday announced that it is launching a paid version of its generative AI-powered Copilot platform for consumers. The option, called Copilot Pro, will cost $20 per month per user, and give users access to a number of additional capabilities including access to the latest AI models and improved AI image generation via Image Creator from Designer.\n\nThe move comes as Microsoft looks to monetize its massive investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and continue to build on the momentum behind generative AI that kicked off in 2023.\n\nMicrosoft says Copilot Pro was developed for individual users who want to get priority access models, including GPT-4 Turbo, OpenAI’s latest offering, during peak usage hours for improved overall performance, as well as the ability to access Copilot across Microsoft’s Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote apps. Microsoft and its OEM partners are adding a new Copilot button to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards as the AI PC generation kicks off. (Image: Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nThe company says that Copilot Pro will provide a single experience on the PC, web, apps, as well as iOS and Android. Microsoft says Copilot Pro will also include access to its Image Creator and the option to customize your own Copilot GPTs for certain topics, whether that’s for working out, cooking, or any other interest you might have.\n\nIn addition to Copilot Pro, Microsoft has also announced that it’s dropping the minimum user limit for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Microsoft previously limited the offering to companies purchasing licenses for 300 seats or more. The change opens up the software to small and medium businesses.\n\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 brings Copilot to the company’s suite of productivity apps including Word, Excel, OneNote, Teams, and more. The enterprise edition of the software also allows companies to expand Copilot to their internal data, giving them the ability to search for and summarize their own content, not just data from the web. Access to the service is priced at $30 per user per month.\n\nMicrosoft is investing $10 billion over 10 years in OpenAI as a means of expanding its position in the enterprise productivity market and with the hope that it can simultaneously steal market share away from rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) in the search market via its AI-powered Bing chat and Edge browser.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine the average consumer subscribing to Copilot Pro, especially for $20 per month, but users who want to dive deeper into using generative AI or need quick access to high-powered AI models could find the service extremely useful.\n\nMore importantly, for Microsoft, the addition of Copilot Pro and opening up Copilot for Microsoft 365 to a larger number of business users will bring in more revenue for its AI efforts, providing Wall Street with further proof that the company is monetizing its investments. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nMicrosoft is moving quickly to push AI as one of its main product offerings. In addition to its Copilot platforms, the company recently debuted a Copilot key for Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The first new key for the Windows keyboard since the introduction of the Windows key itself, the Copilot key provides instant access to the Copilot app on users’ PCs.\n\nElevating Copilot to such a position shows how much Microsoft is set on showing that AI is an enormously important part of its future on a par with cloud computing. But Microsoft isn’t the only company working to seize the AI moment. Google is also selling access to its enterprise-grade productivity suite with its Duet AI platform, while Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM), and others look to gain more traction as well.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Sell in January Before They Crash and Burn",
        "content": "2023 was a rough year for the renewable energy and sustainable investing space. Across wind, solar, lithium and electric vehicle stocks, there was heavy selling. Governments have generally not been as forthcoming with subsidies for green energy as investors had hoped. And with the end of the zero interest rates era, it is increasingly difficult to fund marginal energy projects through the private sector as well.\n\nMany investors are betting on a turnaround for EV stocks and other renewable energy plays in 2024. That could happen, of course. But the recent sell-off has exposed the fraught economics and challenged business models that many of the companies are operating. These are three EV stocks to sell that are unlikely to recover to anywhere near their prior share-price peaks going forward.\n\nNikola (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a while, Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) was a fun story. With charismatic founder Trevor Milton at the helm, Nikola seemed to have a unique approach to hydrogen that could transform the EV industry. Alas, much of Milton’s talk was just that; the company was unable to deliver on initial projections. Milton has now been convicted of fraud, and his company’s brand is tarnished.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, Nikola didn’t give up. It brought in a new management team and built a plant in Arizona. Despite the inauspicious beginnings, investors held out hope that Nikola could mount a turnaround.\n\n2023, however seems to have ended the hopes around this unlikely comeback story. The company’s CFO resigned amid a product recall and large operating losses.\n\nLet’s be frank: Nikola had a second chance after its prior controversies. It has now squandered that opportunity as well. It’s time for investors to stop giving Nikola more money. With the EV industry in a downturn, only the strong will survive. Nikola is simply not built to last.\n\nCanoo (GOEV) Person holding mobile phone with website of US electric vehicle manufacturer Canoo Inc. (GOEV) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nCanoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) is a fledgling EV maker with an uncertain business model. At the time of its SPAC deal, Canoo suggested that it could both be a leading EV maker on its own while also licensing out its core technologies to other players in the industry. This appealing hybrid model attracted a lot of investor capital.\n\nHowever, problems arose almost immediately on both fronts and the company’s projections failed to become reality. Long story short, Canoo has now been public since 2020 and has generated a grand total of $1 million in revenues since it went public.\n\nCanoo recently rallied as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives placed a $4 price target on GOEV stock. That would represent tremendous upside if it happened. But given its lack of revenues, large cash burn and unproven business model, it is hard to see Canoo turning things around.\n\nFinally, while Canoo is a penny stock that might seem cheap, investors should note that the company has a jaw-dropping 872 million shares of stock outstanding. This means that Canoo still has a market cap of $175 million, which is far too high given the firm’s lack of revenues or any demonstrable commercial success.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors have seemingly distinguished between the small electric vehicle companies and the ones with better funding and stronger backers. While the crop of unproven EV companies that went public via SPAC have largely imploded, people are holding out hopes for the more credible EV companies.\n\nOr, at least, that appeared to be the case. But investors might need to change that assumption. Look at Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID), which by all accounts makes very nice vehicles. However, Lucid is losing incredible sums of cash, and investors have essentially given up on LCID stock. Shares are down 29% this past month alone and more than 60% over the past year as it seems increasingly unlikely that Lucid will ever become profitable.\n\nThis leads to the question, which other larger EV company is set to lose its luster thanks to massive operating losses? Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is the most likely candidate. While the company rode a tremendous wave of enthusiasm due to its Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) partnership, actual operating results have been decidedly underwhelming to put it mildly.\n\nOver the past year, Rivian lost a stunning $5.6 billion while generating just $3.8 billion in revenues. Analysts project that the company will continue losing money through at least the year 2027. How long will investors fund this whirlwind of operating losses and shareholder dilution? I expect Rivian shares to follow Lucid’s lead and collapse toward penny stock territory as reality sets in.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "PVH Shares Remain Attractively Priced",
        "content": "The consumer discretionary sector was among 2023's big winners, though gains were concentrated among a few leaders, including Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), as well as a handful of travel stocks and homebuilders. While there are questions about how consumers will fare in 2024, one growing apparel company with strong profitability trends appears poised for more gains.\n\nPVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) sports a low valuation and high earnings growth over the coming quarters. While its technical situation is mixed, I see more upside ahead.\n\nApparel stocks underperformed discretionary in 2023\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with WBD. PVH Shares Remain Attractively Priced\n\nCompany description\n\nAccording to Bank of America Global Research, PVH has an international presence in the apparel industry through two primary segments: Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. It operates through three distribution channels: wholesale, retail and licensing operations. It designs and markets apparel in more than 40 countries, primarily through e-commerce outlets and physical stores.\n\nKey data\n\nSporting a $7 billion market cap, the New York-based apparel, accessories and luxury goods company within the consumer discretionary sector trades at a low 11.2 forward 12-month non-GAAP price-earnings ratio, and the company pays a low 0.1% dividend yield. With earnings not due out until March, the stock carries a moderately high 30% implied volatility percentage with a material short interest of 4.30% as of Jan. 10.\n\nColor on the quarter\n\nBack in November, PVH reported a significant bottom-line beat. Fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share verified at $2.90, easily topping the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.74. Top-line growth of 3.5% from year-ago levels led to $2.36 billion in net sales, slightly missing analysts' expectations. The company's 15% operating margin goal by 2025 remains intact following the solid quarter, even with a more modest sales outlook given the weakening consumer environment. The next few quarters will be critical to watch given the rise in the stock, with particular attention being paid to how its European geographic segment performs with significant revenue from that region, and any weakness there is a risk. But with improved inflation trends in Europe, there's reason for optimism. Big picture, the company reduced selling, general and administrative costs while its North America segment produced robust margin numbers in both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger as it grows its direct-to-consumer channel.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the company can hit its 15% operating margin target, then this year's earnings forecast should easily be hit. Execution is key in 2024 amid several macro crosscurrents, and the latest advance in the share price sets the bar a bit higher than what was seen during the middle of last year. Still, PVH's strong international presence, top-line momentum and improved balance sheet are tailwinds for the coming years.\n\nPVH sales mix PVH Shares Remain Attractively Priced\n\nCompetitor analysis\n\nCompared to its peers, PVH is relatively undervalued given its earnings multiple and modest enterprise value/Ebitda ratio under 9. For shareholders, the stock lacks a decent yield, and you can find retailers more focused on distributions, but I assert that PVH's improved margin story and international growth opportunities are worthy of being invested in right now. Also consider that PVH has among the best growth prospects in its industry while share price momentum trends have been robust in recent months. Finally, amid weak apparel company earnings per share revisions lately, PVH stands out with a slew of earnings upgrades over the past 90 days.\n\nRisks\n\nKey risks for the company include a softer macroeconomic environment, particularly if consumer spending trends weaken. Being a company with a mix of U.S. and international sales, adverse currency movements are always a risk. Rising input costs and labor challenges could also derail the margin expansion story. A particular concern heading into 2024 is what could unfold in Europe. About half of PVH's sales stem from Europe, with an even larger share of its profits from that region. If we see continued soft economic data, including retail sales, then PVH could be a laggard. I will also be keeping a watchful eye on PVH's promotional activity.\n\nValuation\n\nOn valuation, analysts at Bank of America see earnings jumping 17% this year after a dip in 2023. Per-share profit growth is expected to accelerate in 2025 with continued ample earnings growth in 2026. The current consensus outlook calls for mid-teens earnings per share increases, with perhaps easing growth by 2026, however. The improved profitability trend will likely be driven by margin expansion given that forecasters see PVH's top line rising by just 1% this year and near 0% next year.\n\nDividends, meanwhile, are projected to hold at a very low rate as the company focuses on reinvesting capital into high-growth initiatives. With a low teens operating earnings multiple, the company appears as a solid value play with significant growth opportunities. If we apply a low to mid-teens price-earnings ratio, between PVH's long-term average (10.7) and the sector median (15.6), and assume $10.80 of non-GAAP earnings per share over the next 12 months, then the share price should be near $142, making the stock significantly undervalued today.\n\nPVH: Earnings, valuation and free cash flow forecasts PVH Shares Remain Attractively Priced\n\nLooking ahead, corporate event data provided by Wall Street Horizon show an unconfirmed fourth-quarter 2023 earnings date of Monday, March 25. No other volatility catalysts are seen on the calendar.\n\nCorporate Event Risk Calendar PVH Shares Remain Attractively Priced\n\nThe technical take\n\nPVH has been a major winner from the stock market bottom in October of 2022. Notice in the chart below that shares nearly tripled from a low near $43 to the December 2023 peak above $123. A pullback is currently underway, which is not surprising given the stock rallied right up to its 2021 range highs between $121 and $125. I would expect further consolidation, potentially forming a bullish cup with handle pattern. The thinking is investors who bought the stock in 2021 may look to sell in order to get back to breakeven, creating some pressure on the stock. Once that supply is out of the way then I see technical opportunities for PVH to continue its rally, potentially up to its 2018 high near $169.\n\nI also spot a high amount of volume by price from the low $80s up to $110 that makes for a natural support area on pullbacks. Also consider that PVH's long-term 200-day moving average is now upwardsloping, suggesting the bulls are in control, though shares are working off technical overbought conditions, as seen in the relative strength indicator momentum oscillator at the bottom of the graph.\n\nOverall, the technical situation is healthy long term, though a pullback is in the works and a major area of support is seen at the 2023 range highs in the mid-$90s.\n\nPVH: A pause in the advance, strong recent momentum, $169 in play, mid-$90s support PVH Shares Remain Attractively Priced\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI see shares of PVH as undervalued, though a pause in the uptrend appears to be taking place. With support in the mid-$90s and fundamental upside to the low to mid-$140s, this apparel company looks strong as 2024 progresses.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Looking for a Growth Stock? 3 Reasons Why Amazon (AMZN) is a Solid Choice",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 7.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 34.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 30.6%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Amazon has an S/TA ratio of 1.17, which means that the company gets $1.17 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.8, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Amazon is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 11.6% this year versus the industry average of 9.7%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Amazon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.3% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmazon has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "M&amp;A Watch: 3 Tech Stocks With ‘Takeover Target’ Potential",
        "content": "With even the Federal Reserve’s hawks like John Williams indicating that the central bank is done raising rates for the foreseeable future, the outlook for rates has become much more certain. As a result, companies are becoming more comfortable borrowing the funds needed to acquire other firms. Given the latter situation, I expect mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the tech sector to take off tremendously this year. Indicating this phenomenon has already started, Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) earlier this month announced it agreed to acquire telecom and data center equipment provider Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) for $40 per share. Before the deal was disclosed, JNPR stock was changing hands for around $30 per share. Now, it’s selling for about $37.51. Here are three other potential takeover targets in the tech sector that can generate much bigger profits for investors.\n\nExtreme Networks (EXTR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike Juniper, Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR) sells equipment to data centers. Among Extreme’s offerings are wide area-network infrastructure equipment and a cloud network management solution.\n\nThe proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) is greatly increasing the utilization of data centers since the lion’s share of the data used by AI systems is stored there. What’s more, AI systems are usually created in data centers. Given these points, the demand for data center equipment should jump over the longer term, making EXTR one of the more attractive takeover targets in the tech sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso noteworthy is that analysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to climb to $1.24 in 2024 from $1.09 in 2023, while EXTR stock has a very attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 12.5.\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve long believed that Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), with its sizable captive streaming audience, would make one of the best takeover targets for a struggling media company.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith cord-cutting having greatly weakened the cable ecosystem and multiple media firms struggling to compete against Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the streaming space, a takeover of Roku has become more attractive than ever for many media players.\n\nFor example, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) could both advertise their streaming offerings and other products frequently on Roku if they decide to buy the streaming operating system provider. With Apple and Disney struggling to generate strong growth, I believe they may finally shell out the large amount of funds needed to buy Roku.\n\nIndeed, the one drawback to acquiring Roku is the buyer would probably have to pay at least $25 billion to get the deal done. Still, besides Apple and Disney, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could afford that price relatively easily.\n\nFive9 (FIVN) photo illustration of the Five9 logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFive9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) is well-positioned to benefit from the incorporation of AI into its customer-contact products.\n\nAfter meeting with the firm’s management in November, investment bank Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) wrote that Five9 could get a big boost from selling its AI-enabled products to large companies. Additionally, Piper believes the firm, over the longer term, can benefit from “tech and channel partnerships” along with acquiring important security certification from the federal government.\n\nThese growth catalysts likely caused Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) to attempt buying the company recently. ZM ultimately backed out, but other firms could easily look to buy Five9.\n\nFIVN stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 36, while analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to jump to $1.93 this year from $1.50 in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "What a difference a year makes. After a 2022 when the U.S. suffered through decades-high inflation and the worst stock market performance since 2008, Wall Street staged a heady rebound last year. On the heels of its 35% decline in 2022, the Nasdaq Composite found its footing and gained 43% in 2023.\n\nStudents of economic history will know that the rally is likely to continue in 2024. Going back as far as 1972 -- the first full year that the tech-focused index existed -- in every year following a bear market rebound, the Nasdaq has returned 19%, on average. That pattern suggests that the current rally should still have legs. As in life, there are no guarantees in investing, but stock aficionados would do well to pay attention to the lessons of history.\n\nFurthermore, there's an argument that last year's rally was sparked by the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). It's still early days for generative AI, and companies are scrambling to determine how best to deploy these ground-breaking algorithms. One thing's for sure: Two companies with long histories of integrating AI into their operations are well-situated to profit. Let's look at both. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI stock No. 1: Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the most recognizable companies in the world, with business interests that stretch across a broad cross-section of both the consumer and commercial markets. A large contributor to Amazon's success has been the company's integration of AI into two business areas where it's the industry leader and a third where it's a major contender. The combination of its businesses in e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital advertising gives Amazon reach that's hard to rival.\n\nAmazon made a name for itself in digital retail, and it still dominates in that space. While the numbers for 2023 are still being compiled, Amazon accounted for roughly 38% of all online sales in the U.S. in 2022, more than the next 14 competitors combined, according to data specialist Statista. Improving economic conditions will likely drive Amazon's business higher over the coming year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company's rivals have chipped away at its supremacy in recent years, Amazon's long history of implementing AI across its operations has given it a consistent edge. And the company isn't taking its foot off the gas. It's deploying generative AI to improve the relevance of its product recommendations, surface more content that suits the tastes of its Prime Video viewers, ensure more accurate product reviews, and even help third-party sellers create more effective merchandise descriptions.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was the first modern cloud infrastructure provider, a market the company still leads today, with a roughly 31% worldwide market share, according to analytics firm Canalys. These users are the principal audience and target market for Amazon's AI offerings.\n\nThe company is also becoming a force to be reckoned with in digital advertising. In the third quarter, its ad revenue grew 26% year over year, outpacing the growth of industry leaders Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms, which grew 9% and 24%, respectively.\n\nAmazon's digital advertising ambitions will get a significant boost later this month as the company begins showing \"limited advertising\" on Prime Video. While viewers will have the option to pay $3 per month to opt out, Amazon will make more money either way. The company will use its AI prowess to ensure its digital ads reach their target markets.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of Amazon's recent AI expansion will undoubtedly be the company's cloud segment. The recently introduced Amazon Bedrock provides a host of AI models for AWS customers. The platform will also help cloud users create business-centric generative AI applications that will integrate each company's proprietary user data, improving the usefulness of the apps.\n\nThough the company has multiple growth drivers, the stock remains inexpensive. It's currently trading for 2 times forward sales, a significant discount to its five-year average multiple of 3.4. This provides astute investors the chance to buy shares on the cheap, before the current rally carries Amazon higher.\n\nAI stock No. 2: Alphabet\n\nAs is the case with Amazon, there are plenty of reasons to buy Alphabet stock, starting with the company's industry-leading position in two markets and strong position in a third.\n\nWhen it comes to internet search, Google is without equal. It controls 92% of the market, according to web analytics company StatCounter. Google was using AI to improve the accuracy of its search algorithms long before it was fashionable, giving the company a seemingly insurmountable lead that it continues to hold. Alphabet recently announced plans to further cement that lead by imbuing its search engine with generative AI functionality.\n\nAlphabet's search dominance fuels the company's digital advertising, and it remains the industry leader. Alphabet was responsible for 30% of digital advertising worldwide in 2022, according to data compiled by online trade publication Digiday, and the company is expected to maintain that lead when the books are closed on 2023.\n\nGoogle continues to empower advertisers, developing a suite of generative AI-powered improvements that make it easier to customize the text and images used in ads. This, in turn, leads to more profitable ad campaigns. The ongoing rebound in ad spending will likely fuel further gains for Alphabet in the coming year.\n\nFinally, Google Cloud is one of the \"big three\" cloud infrastructure providers, and was the fastest growing among its rivals in six of the past seven quarters. This also provides the company with a captive audience and pre-screened target market for its AI offerings.\n\nYet for all this growth potential, Alphabet remains historically cheap, selling for just 21 times earnings, well below the price-to-earnings ratio of 26 for the S&P 500. In view of its multiple growth areas, investors should get in on this discount while it lasts.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "If you’re looking for reliability, you can’t go wrong with most of the blue-chip stocks.\n\nYou get proven businesses that have stood the test of time. Better, you’re investing in a company that’s not likely to go out of business any time soon. All because most offer products and services millions of us use every day. Plus, with many of the top blue-chip stocks you can even collect yield from them along the way.\n\nLook at AT&T (NYSE:T), for example. After a miserable year for the telecom stock, I mentioned it as a beaten-down blue-chip stock opportunity on Nov. 17. At the time, it traded at $15.60. Not long after, it would hit a high of $17.47, with a near 7% yield to boot.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition to AT&T, here are some other top blue-chip stocks you can buy on the cheap.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Southwest Airlines (LUV) Southwest Airlines logo on aircraft that is taking off from McCarran in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nSource: Eliyahu Yosef Parypa / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Nov. 17, I also highlighted an opportunity in Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), as it traded at $24.50.\n\nAt the time, I noted, “the airline stock plummeted to a low of $22.01 – a low it hasn’t seen since 2014. However, with a good deal of negativity priced into the stock, the pullback appears a bit overdone.” Not long after, LUV would hit $29.84 and could see higher highs. Better, as we wait for further recovery, we can collect its current yield of 2.41%.\n\nHelping, analysts at Susquehanna just raised their price target to $30 from $23 on the LUV stock. “The firm believes 2024 is setting up to be a year where idiosyncratic factors drive absolute and relative stock returns for the airlines, with network exposure, the ‘premiumization’ of travel, fleets and order books, labor, service, and cost control driving the investment narratives and debates,” as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) the front wheels of a series of cars in a line\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nI also highlighted Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) on Nov. 17, as it traded at around $136. While it’s only up to $138.43, give it time. I still believe it could refill its bearish gap around $147.50, with patience. Plus, as we wait for that to happen, we can collect its yield of 2.75%. There’s nothing wrong with getting paid to wait – especially with a top blue-chip stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, earnings haven’t been anything to write home about, but most of that negativity has been priced into the stock. In its most recent quarter, the company posted third quarter EPS of $2.49, which beat expectations by seven cents. Unfortunately, revenue of $5.82 billion – up 2.5% year-over-year – did miss by $90 million.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaper. Blue-Chip Stocks at Low\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there’s always an exchange-traded fund to buy into. With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG) invests at least 80% of its funds in blue chip companies. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and many more of the biggest, most well-respected stocks on the market.\n\nSince the end of October, the ETF did run from about $27.50 to a high of $33.70. At its current price, it has become slightly over-extended and could see a healthy pullback. So, you may want to wait for that to happen before jumping in. Longer-term, I’d like to see it closer to $40.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also Nike (NYSE:NKE).\n\nOver the last few weeks, the stock gapped from about $122.85 to $105.90. All on news of concerning sales outlook. However, it looks like most of that negativity has been priced in, with the stock attempting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. The last time these indicators became this oversold, NKE bounced from about $89 to $122.85. From its current price of $105.90, I’d like to see it refill its gap around $122.85 again soon.\n\nBetter, while we wait for NKE to recover, we can collect its yield of 1.4%. Furthermore, analysts at Truist just raised their price target on NKE to $111 from $107. Citi analysts have also called the pullback a buying opportunity, with a $135 price target.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe can also look at Realty Income (NYSE:O), which pays out a monthly dividend, and carries a current yield of 5.19%.  Most recently, the company declared its 643rd consecutive monthly dividend of $0.2565 per share, or $3.078 annualized, payable on Feb. 15 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 1.\n\nNot only is Realty Income a reliable, dividend-paying realty powerhouse, it’s been around for more than 50 years now.

        "title": "MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of MercadoLibre (MELI)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $1678 in the previous session. MercadoLibre has gained 5.5% since the start of the year compared to the 27.9% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 55.2% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 1, 2023, MercadoLibre reported EPS of $7.16 versus consensus estimate of $5.85 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5.22%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, MercadoLibre is expected to post earnings of $35.14 per share on $14.34 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $50.83 per share on $17.54 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 57.61% and 22.28%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nMercadoLibre may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nMercadoLibre has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 47.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 20.1X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 94.3X versus its peer group's average of 15.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.11. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, MercadoLibre currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if MercadoLibre passes the test. Thus, it seems as though MercadoLibre shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nHow Does MELI Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of MELI have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). AMZN has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Amazon.com, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 46.55%, and for the current fiscal year, AMZN is expected to post earnings of $3.61 per share on revenue of $570.95 billion.\n\nShares of Amazon.com, Inc. have gained 3.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 42.88X and a P/CF of 32.18X.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is in the top 39% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MELI and AMZN, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +276.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 points to a change of +278.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.61 indicates a change of +34.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $166.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.3%. The $570.95 billion and $637.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.1% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.6%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.20 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $141.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.1%. The EPS surprise was +46.55%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the top e-commerce company in the world. Its Prime Day and Black Friday sales often serve as indicators for how well the global economy is doing. Moreover, it's been a fantastic growth stock. A $20,000 investment in it 20 years ago would be worth more than $1.1 million today.\n\nBut as well as it has performed over the long haul, it has slowed down in recent years. There's another stock, also involved in e-commerce and tech, that has been an even better buy of late, and that's Shopify(NYSE: SHOP).\n\nRoutinely outperforming Amazon since 2016\n\nShopify went public in 2015 and has been red-hot ever since. Aside from 2022, when the markets as a whole struggled, Shopify has delivered consistently positive returns since 2016 (its first full year on the market). And it has also done better than Amazon in almost every one of those years. Source: YCharts. Chart by author.\n\nWhat has made Shopify successful is its ability to help anyone become an online vendor quickly and easily. For a recurring fee, it will help any business set up and manage an online shop to sell its goods and services all over the world. And there is no need to go onto a different platform, such as Amazon, to sell those items. Merchants can do so right on their own websites.\n\nThe proof is in the growth rate\n\nThe ease of use and attractiveness of Shopify's services have enabled it to be a big player in e-commerce. And a big reason for the stock's superior returns over Amazon in recent years is that its growth rate has also been significantly higher. AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAMZN revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nThe advantages Shopify has are that as a smaller company, it takes much less growth in absolute terms to provide it with faster growth on a percentage basis, and it has more room to expand its footprint, especially in a massive industry such as e-commerce. Its revenue over the past four quarters totaled $6.7 billion, while Amazon generated more than $554 billion in sales during the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors' hopes that Shopify will become the \"next Amazon\" are likely a key reason why the stock has performed so well and been such a hot buy. But even today, its market capitalization is just under $100 billion -- nowhere near the $1.5 trillion market cap of Amazon.\n\nIs Shopify a better stock?\n\nBoth Shopify and Amazon are attractive growth stock options for investors to consider for the long haul, and it would be hard to go wrong with either one for your portfolio, especially as the global economy grows.\n\nBut I do believe that Shopify can continue to outperform Amazon. Over the years, Amazon has been diversifying into industries like healthcare and video streaming in an effort to expand its growth opportunities. But I think by focusing primarily on e-commerce, Shopify could produce better results in the long run.\n\nIf you want to buy only one of these stellar e-commerce stocks, then buy Shopify. But there would be nothing wrong with investing in both.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Sitting on Cash? These 2 Stocks Are Great Buys",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from surpassing the high of 4,796 it hit on Jan. 3, 2022, which could mean a bull market is right around the corner. ^SPX Chart\n\nA sell-off in 2022 caused the index to plunge more than 20% from its high, and we've been in a bear market ever since. However, many stocks surged last year thanks to easing inflation and excitement over burgeoning sectors like artificial intelligence (AI). The market is likely to continue on its current trajectory in 2024.\n\nSo if you've been sitting on some cash and waiting for the right moment, now could be a great time to expand your portfolio with stocks likely to flourish in a bull market. Here are two great buys this month.\n\n1. Costco\n\nCostco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) made headlines in December when it announced a special dividend of $15 per share that was paid out on Jan. 12. The company has become known for these surprise payouts, with the last one being $10 per share in 2020. Its regular dividend is fairly small, with a yield of 0.61%. However, consistent and significant long-term growth alongside these random cash surprises makes Costco's stock an attractive investment. COST Chart\n\nThis chart shows that since 2019, the company has significantly outperformed its biggest U.S. competitors in stock growth. Costco has won over consumers worldwide with its unique business model of charging an annual subscription fee for access to market-low prices in a wholesale setting.\n\nIts membership-based business model has changed the game in retail. Product sales don't actually amount to much in profits. However, in fiscal 2023 Costco hit more than $6 billion in profits, with membership fees making up 73% of that. Alongside a 90% subscription renewal rate, the company has a promising outlook.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is rapidly expanding its global footprint. The retail giant currently runs 871 stores in 14 different countries. Yet it still has massive growth potential. In six of those countries, Costco has five or fewer locations, indicating plenty of room to expand before even venturing into new nations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the last five years, Costco's annual revenue has risen 59%, with operating income up 76%. However, the most impressive growth is in its free cash flow, which has soared 231% to nearly $9 billion, suggesting the company has the funds to fuel its international expansion and overcome potential headwinds.\n\nCostco is an expensive option, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 43, significantly higher than the S&P 500 average of 22. However, the company has likely earned that high price tag with its considerable cash reserves, consistent growth, and a highly profitable business model.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nWhile Costco is killing it on the brick-and-mortar side of retail, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is dominating the online sector. The company has leading market shares in e-commerce in multiple countries, with its share at 38% in the U.S. alone. Comparatively, the second-largest share is held by Walmart with 6% of the market.\n\nAmazon's command of online retail has even seen it unintentionally dominate other industries. For instance, the company was responsible for nearly 70% of all U.S. video game purchases as of September 2023. Amazon's vast reach gives it the brand power and financial resources to expand to other lucrative markets like cloud computing and AI.\n\nMoreover, the company has undergone extensive restructuring over the last two years with the goal of increasing profitability. Moves like closing dozens of warehouses, shuttering unprofitable projects, and thousands of layoffs have fortified its business and made it less vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds. Since last January, Amazon's free cash flow has skyrocketed 427% to $17 billion thanks to recent restructuring.\n\nAs a result, the tech giant is sinking billions into its most profitable business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cloud platform accounts for about 16% of the company's revenue, yet brings in over 60% of its operating income. Meanwhile, the platform grants Amazon a powerful position in the budding AI market as businesses increasingly turn to cloud services to integrate the technology into their workflow. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon's stock is an exciting option as the company has growth catalysts in multiple markets. Its stock is up over 60% year over year. Yet it remains down about 17% from a high it achieved in July 2021, suggesting plenty of room for growth.\n\nAdditionally, the chart above shows Amazon's price-to-sales ratio is one of the lowest in tech, indicating its stock offers the most value. So if you've been sitting on cash, Amazon is a screaming buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

The e-commerce and cloud services leader is a biggie in the Nasdaq-100, though, with its weight in the index lagging behind only Apple and Microsoft.\n\nBerkshire's portfolio also includes another top 20 stock in the Nasdaq-100 -- T-Mobile US(NASDAQ: TMUS). The telecommunications company is a relatively small position for Buffett, with Berkshire's stake currently worth around $850 million.\n\nNext up is Charter Communications(NASDAQ: CHTR). The weight for this communications stock ranks it at No. 56 in the Nasdaq-100. Berkshire owns over 3.8 million shares of Charter worth roughly $1.4 billion.\n\nKraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) is the No. 60 stock in the Nasdaq-100 and has been a key holding for Buffett for years. Berkshire owns 26.5% of the food company. Kraft Heinz is even included on Berkshire's website's list of subsidiaries.\n\nLast -- and, in this case, least -- is Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). The satellite radio company barely made the Nasdaq-100. It's also a really small position in Berkshire's portfolio, with the conglomerate's stake in Sirius XM currently worth only around $50 million.\n\nA process of elimination\n\nWhich of these six Nasdaq-100 stocks that Buffett owns is the best pick? It depends on what your investment priorities are. If you're looking for income, Kraft Heinz offers the highest dividend yield. But most investors are interested in Nasdaq-100 stocks for growth, so let's focus on which stock is likely to deliver the most growth. We can use a process of elimination.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think we can immediately rule out Kraft Heinz. A consumer defensive stock usually won't generate inspiring growth.\n\nT-Mobile probably has some upside potential this year. However, the company continues to face significant competition in the wireless market. I wouldn't pick it as the most likely to succeed among these Buffett stocks.\n\nSirius XM has done a whole lot of nothing over the last five years. There are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the stock. Podcasting especially could be a growth driver. Still, I don't view Sirius XM as the stand-out winner among these Nasdaq-100 stocks.\n\nWhat about Charter Communications, which -- like T-Mobile -- provides wireless services? Wall Street thinks the stock could take off this year. The average 12-month price target is nearly 25% above Charter's current share price. I think the stock is possibly a contender, but cord-cutting could still weigh on the company's cable business.\n\nBuffett's favorite stock (other than Berkshire) is no doubt Apple. I wouldn't bet against Apple over the long run. However, its valuation is kind of steep right now with no rock-solid catalysts on the way. Sure, the company's new Vision Pro mixed-reality device could make a splash. With its hefty price tag, though, I wouldn't bank on it moving the needle all that much for Apple right out of the gate.\n\nBuffett's best Nasdaq-100 stock to buy right now\n\nThat leaves only one Nasdaq-100 stock in Buffett's portfolio -- Amazon. I think that Amazon is the best stock to buy now of the group. There are some good reasons why it was the best performer by far over the last 12 months among the six stocks.\n\nThe company's profitability has increased sharply (earnings more than tripled year over year in the latest reported quarter). I fully expect this trend to continue as a result of Amazon's renewed focus on its bottom line.\n\nAmazon continues to find new markets to enter. Healthcare, online car sales, and supply chain management services are three relatively recent examples. The company has also made a big push into advertising, which makes perfect sense.\n\nMost importantly, in my view, Amazon has a massive opportunity with the increased adoption of generative AI. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top cloud services provider based on market share. CEO Andy Jassy argued in the company's third-quarter conference call that customers want to run their AI models where their data is. I agree. That bodes well for AWS.\n\nThere are a handful of stocks that I think every investor should seriously consider owning. Amazon definitely makes that list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Recent high $155.63): Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos in his garage in 1994, is the most dominant e-commerce company and owns Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading cloud provider. Andy Jassy, formerly head of AWS, became CEO of Amazon in 2021 and is executing exceptionally well. Because of their scale, AWS and Amazon retail benefit from numerous competitive advantages, which in turn drive a high customer value proposition. For example, instead of using the benefits of size to maximize short-term profits, Amazon operates with a scale-economies-shared business model, giving back some of its margin to the underlying consumer. This in turn drives further demand and strengthens the company’s ecosystem. Amazon’s long-term strategy masks the underlying earnings power of the business. As consumers continue to shift their spending from in-store purchases to online shopping, and as data continues to migrate from on-premise servers to the cloud, we expect Amazon to grow revenue at a low double-digit rate for at least the next five years and increase its profit margins over time.\"\n\nStory continues Amazon\n\ndaniel-eledut-a8KNFpidIPI-unsplash (1)\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "This 1 Move Could Add Nearly $5 Billion to Amazon's Bottom Line in 2024, According to a Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime is making a big change to its membership later this month, and while some members might not like it, investors should love it.\n\nStarting on Jan. 29, Prime Video subscribers will start seeing ad breaks in the middle of their favorite shows like Jack Ryan and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. If they don't want to see ads, Amazon will offer the chance to upgrade Prime subscriptions to an ad-free tier for $2.99 per month.\n\nThe move follows similar ad-tier introductions from Disney(NYSE: DIS) and Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX). Both said they've seen a lot of success with their ad-supported tiers, and Bank of America analyst Justin Post thinks Amazon can see comparable benefits. He estimates the change will add $4.8 billion in revenue for Amazon between the higher-priced tier and additional ad revenue. And since the marginal cost of introducing ads to Prime Video is minimal, almost all of that will flow to Amazon's bottom line.\n\nHere's what investors can expect when Amazon introduces ads in Prime Video. Image source: Amazon.\n\nThe undeniable success of ad-supported streaming\n\nThe big media companies have been making their ad-supported tiers more and more attractive to consumers over the last year.\n\nAmazon is following the same pricing strategy Disney adopted when it introduced its ad-supported tier for Disney+ in 2022. If subscribers didn't want to pay an extra $3 per month, they could pay the same price they had been and sit through a few ads. Last year, Disney raised prices again, but only on the ad-free versions of its streaming services.\n\nNetflix introduced a low-priced ad-supported version of its service in late 2022. Subsequently, it removed the ability to sign up for its basic ad-free plan and raised the price on ad-supported plan for existing subscribers.\n\nThe move points to a clear preference for streaming services to push consumers to their ad-supported tier. Disney CEO Bob Iger told analysts as much during last year's second-quarter earnings call. He'd much rather have subscribers sign up for the ad-supported tier, \"the obvious reason [being] because the ARPU potential of the ad service Disney+.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix is seeing a lot of success generating ad revenue, too. In its first-quarter earnings report last year, the company said its ad-supported tier generated more revenue per account than its standard subscription plan, which charged $8.50 more per month. And that was in the middle of a weak advertising market.\n\nAmazon will attempt to capture that massive upside of advertising by defaulting subscribers to the ad-supported tier. That could result in a huge new audience for advertisers when the company flips the switch on the ad tier. And it could be a massive benefit for investors.\n\nJust how big is the opportunity for Amazon?\n\nPost breaks down his analysis of the Prime Video advertising opportunity simply.\n\nHe thinks 70% of Amazon's 150 million Prime Video viewers won't do a thing with their subscription. They'll accept the ads in exchange for not having to pay anything more per month for Prime (or go through the hassle of changing their subscription). The other 30% -- 45 million people -- will pay the extra $2.99 per month.\n\nImportantly, the cost for Amazon to implement the new ad-supported tier is minimal. Amazon already has a massive advertising business that brought in more than $43 billion over the previous 12 months through the third quarter of last year. It also already has limited advertising in Prime Video during its sports broadcasts like Thursday Night Football. In other words, all the infrastructure is in place for the company to sell and deliver a lot of advertising for Prime Video.\n\nSo practically all of that additional revenue will flow to Amazon's operating income. Post points out that should further boost Amazon's operating margin, which is already approaching recent highs. He believes the Prime video changes could add another 50 basis points to Amazon's North American operating margin.\n\nAmazon's stock climbed higher in 2023 on the back of beating Wall Street's earnings expectations in each of the first three quarters of the year. If Post is right about the impact of advertisements in Prime Video, it could result in another earnings beat and drive the stock higher still.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "It’s almost time for the 4Q23 reports to start pouring in and going by some of the latest data, investors should get ready for a solid display from Amazon (AMZN).\n\nAccording to the Truist Card data, firm analyst Youssef Squali notes that Amazon’s US Revenue for 4Q23 is tracking “slightly ahead” of consensus expectations of $103.1 billion, and nearer to ~$104 billion. Squali is calling for $104.3 billion, amounting to a 11.7% year-over-year increase.\n\nAs such, for the quarter, Squali expects total revenues to outpace the Street’s forecast, anticipating $167.1 billion (up 12% YoY), ahead of the Street’s call for $166.0 billion, (an 11.2% YoY increase) and right at the top-end of the guide for $160-167 billion. “Importantly,” says the 5-star analyst, “we expect Amazon to show continued share gains over this past Holiday Season and believe the company’s 4Q23 NA Revenues have benefited from strong US online holiday sales.”\n\nAccording to Adobe, US Online Holiday Sales (between November 1 and December 31) reached a record- $222.1 billion, amounting to almost 5% growth and which Squali thinks serves as a strong omen Amazon performed well. Although Amazon did not offer any specific details, it did say sales over its extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday event (November 17 – 27) increased on a YoY basis and hit record levels.\n\nOver the last 20+ years, Amazon has been growing its share of the ecommerce market, and continues to be the driving force, with Squali estimating it commanded a 50% share in 4Q23 and ~48% for the full year.\n\nSquali credits the ongoing increase in market share to the company’s extensive product range, “best-in-class delivery speeds,” the effectiveness of Prime, and the introduction of services such as Buy with Prime and Supply Chain by Amazon. “We continue to believe BwP along with Supply Chain by Amazon represent material growth drivers for the company in 2024 and beyond, and we believe AMZN has a running start to address this $100B+ opportunity, given its scale and its proven AWS playbook,” The analyst summed up.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo this end, Squali reiterated a Buy rating on the shares and raised his price target from $176 to $180, making room for 12-month returns of 16%. (To watch Squali’s track record, click here)\n\nSquali is just one of many Wall Street AMZN bulls. In fact, all currently are, with the stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating based on a unanimous 42 Buys. The average target stands at $184.23, suggesting shares will post growth of 19% in the year ahead.

        "title": "My 3 Highest-Conviction Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "No investment is a sure thing. Every stock you buy comes with some risk. And without risk, there would be no opportunity for reward.\n\nThat said, some stocks have lower risks than others. Some also have bigger opportunities for rewards than others. Which picks offer the best risk-reward propositions right now? Here are my three highest-conviction growth stocks to buy in 2024.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) certainly looks attractive from a risk perspective. It dominates the e-commerce market. Amazon's logistics and supply chain network is unsurpassed, giving the company an enviable moat.\n\nThe company also has a huge growth opportunity -- and not just in e-commerce. Amazon Web Services (AWS) ranks as the largest cloud services provider. Organizations will almost certainly continue racing to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI). This should enable AWS to grow rapidly, even with stiff competition from Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.\n\nI like that Amazon has retained a start-up mentality in many ways. It continually looks at new markets to enter. For example, the company launched a supply chain management service last year and just began selling cars online. Jeff Bezos' statement from years ago that \"your margin is my opportunity\" remains a core component of Amazon's business model.\n\nThe stock is also a great pick to buy right now, in my view, because of its intense focus on improving profitability. Amazon's earnings more than tripled year over year in the third quarter of 2023. It expects Prime Video to become profitable in the not-too-distant future. I expect these efforts to show up in Amazon's quarterly results this year and provide nice catalysts that further boost its share price.\n\n2. Brookfield Renewable\n\nBrookfield Renewable(NYSE: BEP)(NYSE: BEPC) fully expects to deliver average total returns of between 12% and 15% per year. Those kinds of returns can double your money every five to six years. I'm confident the company will be able to achieve its goal over the long term, even though Brookfield Renewable's shares haven't performed well over the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf history is any guide, Brookfield Renewable will be able to pull it off. The renewable energy provider's average total return since 1999 is close to 16%. Its funds from operations (FFO) per unit have increased by a compound annual growth rate of more than 10% since 2012.\n\nI have no doubt whatsoever that the demand for renewable energy will continue to rise over the next several years. For one thing, solar and onshore wind are now more cost-effective than coal and gas. Countries and major corporations across the world have also committed to aggressive carbon emission reduction goals that will be impossible to achieve without additional renewable energy.\n\nBut is Brookfield Renewable prepared to meet the increasing demand? Absolutely. The company's development pipeline capacity of 143,400 megawatts is more than 4.5 times greater than its current installed capacity. Brookfield Renewable also continues to expand via acquisitions. There are few companies with as sure-fire growth prospects, in my opinion.\n\n3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nYou might be surprised to see a biotech stock on the list, considering the level of risk they face with potential pipeline setbacks. However, I'm highly optimistic about Vertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) for several reasons.\n\nThe company enjoys a monopoly in treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). Its nearest potential rival is at best years away from even having a chance at competing against Vertex's products. In the meantime, Vertex could be on track to soon roll out its most powerful (and profitable) CF therapy yet assuming the upcoming late-stage results for its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo are positive.\n\nVertex and its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, now have the world's first CRISPR gene-editing therapy on the market. Casgevy has already been approved in the U.S. for treating sickle cell disease with another approval decision for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia on the way in March. Analysts project the new therapy could generate peak annual sales of over $2.2 billion, with Goldman Sachs estimating Casgevy could rake in $3.9 billion.\n\nI also like the prospects for non-opioid pain drug VX-548. Vertex plans to report results from three late-stage studies of the drug early this year, which could lead to near-term regulatory filings.\n\nSure, there's more risk with some of the company's other pipeline programs, including its cell therapies that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes. However, with multiple likely blockbusters largely de-risked and its dominant position in CF, I think that Vertex is a virtual shoo-in to deliver solid growth for years to come.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "My 5 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist for 2024",
        "content": "After touching bear market territory in 2022, the three major indexes rebounded last year -- with the growth-oriented Nasdaq roaring past the S&P 500 for a 43% gain. Of course, no one can predict for sure what the indexes will do this year, but since bear markets have always led to bull markets, there's reason to be optimistic about the future.\n\nAnd that means right now is a great time to start scooping up growth stocks. These players generally excel in rising markets, as we saw last year, but the good news doesn't stop there. If you choose high-quality growth stocks, they're likely to score a win for you over the long haul too.\n\nEven after last year's gains, many of these stocks still trade for reasonable prices -- offering you the perfect buying opportunity. Could 2024 be the year of growth? Maybe. Here are my top five stocks to buy hand over fist to benefit. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nYou could think of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as the ultimate growth stock. The company dominates in two areas that are growing in the double digits -- e-commerce and cloud computing -- and also is on track to win in the hot area of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI is helping Amazon's e-commerce business become more efficient, reducing costs and favoring profit growth. And Amazon Web Services' (AWS) new AI tools should lift demand for its cloud services. This is key because AWS has generally driven Amazon's overall profit.\n\nAnd speaking of profit, Amazon has demonstrated its ability to grow earnings over time, as well as its ability to quickly recover after tough times. After a weak economy drove Amazon to an annual loss in 2022, it improved its cost structure and reported quarterly profit gains last year.\n\nToday, Amazon shares look very reasonably priced compared to their past valuation in relation to forward earnings estimates -- especially considering growth prospects ahead. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n2. Etsy\n\nEtsy(NASDAQ: ETSY) suffered as the economy started to weaken because shoppers weren't able to buy as many discretionary items as they used to. And most of the goods you'll find on Etsy -- handmade and vintage items -- fall into this category.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut here's why Etsy may be set to take off and also offers you top long-term prospects. First, the company managed to keep the revenue gains it made during earlier stages of the pandemic, it's maintained profitability in recent quarters, and it has a solid cash position of more than $1 billion. And second, Etsy's capital-light business model means it doesn't have to heavily invest in infrastructure to grow -- and it can transform 90% of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) into free cash flow.\n\nFinally, Etsy has done a great job of holding on to its customers even during tough times and growing the customer base. Active buyers recently reached a record high of 92 million. And that's why this stock is an absolute steal at only 15 times forward earnings estimates.\n\n3. Chewy\n\nChewy(NYSE: CHWY) reached a major milestone in 2022 when it reported its first annual profit. The online seller of pet supplies kept the good times rolling even through a tough economic environment by increasing overall sales, net sales per active customer, gross margin, and other metrics in the most recent quarter.\n\nThere's reason to believe that, over time, Chewy could take a big chunk out of the $144 billion U.S. total addressable pet market. Through services such as Autoship -- regular, automatic deliveries of your favorite products to your doorstep -- Chewy has proven it can build a loyal customer base. Autoship represents more than 75% of Chewy's total sales.\n\nChewy stands out because it offers a variety of services, from supplies to prescription drugs and pet health insurance -- and the company recently expanded into veterinary care, announcing the opening of its first Chewy Vet Care practices.\n\nToday, Chewy shares trade for 37 times forward earnings estimates -- and that's cheap, considering analysts forecast double-digit growth annually for the company over the coming five years.\n\n4. Teladoc Health\n\nTeladoc Health(NYSE: TDOC) is a leader in the fast-growing market of telemedicine. The company's shares have dropped over the past couple of years as investors worried about Teladoc's ability to turn revenue growth into profit.\n\nBut early last year, the company shifted its strategy to balance its quest for revenue growth with its aim to reach profitability. Now, we aren't seeing the double-digit gains in revenue that we saw in the past, but we have been seeing improvement in EBITDA and free cash flow.\n\nTeladoc said it expects to deliver EBITDA and free cash flow growth that will surpass revenue growth over the next few years -- that's thanks to improvements in efficiency now and moving forward. And all of this shows progress along the path to profitability.\n\nThe telemedicine leader also is focusing on a key growth area -- chronic care -- which has helped drive revenue in recent times.\n\nSo Teladoc's growth -- and share performance -- could be poised to take off. And that makes it a steal today, trading at nearly its lowest level ever in relation to sales. TDOC PS Ratio Chart\n\n5. CRISPR Therapeutics\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics' (NASDAQ: CRSP) growth story is just getting started. The gene-editing specialist recently won regulatory approval for its first product -- one that could become a blockbuster. The U.S. approved Casgevy for sickle cell disease and will issue a decision on the product for beta thalassemia in March. The U.K. already authorized the treatment for both blood disorders.\n\nThe biotech company shares revenue with bigger player Vertex Pharmaceuticals, but this new revenue stream still represents a huge milestone. Casgevy sales will help CRISPR Therapeutics fund its other pipeline programs. And the approval is important because it shows regulators are willing to accept treatments based on this new technology -- a technology used across the company's pipeline. So this definitely is positive news for CRISPR Therapeutics moving forward.\n\nToday, CRISPR Therapeutics' shares are trading much lower than they were a few years ago, when we had a lot less visibility on the company's future. Considering the company's recent product approval and growth potential, the shares could explode higher from here -- making them a top stock to own in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analsyt comments.\n\nJPMorgan upgrades Dell, promotes Arista\n\nJPMorgan analysts upgraded Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) to Overweight from Neutral, citing the company’s leverage to the AI-led Compute investment cycle.\n\nThe cycle “will benefit branded server companies (DELL and HPE in our coverage), even as the drivers for the remaining businesses are more mixed, being subject to the macro backdrop,” the analyst said.\n\nSimilarly, they promoted Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) to top pick on accelerating growth from AI ramp.\n\n“We expect the valuation premium currently (33x P/E vs. long-term average of 28x) to be sustained or even expand as AI revenues ramp, driving higher visibility into the driver for growth acceleration.”\n\nBMO says Alphabet and Amazon best-positioned AI wise\n\nBMO initiated research coverage of 25 stocks in the internet sector, including sub sectors like digital advertising, ecommerce, online travel, advertising/marketing-tech and interactive media.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, BMO analysts highlighted Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as best-positioned to “benefit from the proliferation of generative AI and large language models.”\n\n“While the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014 resulted in a step function increase in AI capabilities, Google has integrated machine learning (“ML”) into its core products since 2000 – this effectively gives Alphabet a 10+ year head start relative to the industry.”\n\nElsewhere, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also mentioned as the e-commerce stock is expected “to benefit from artificial intelligence/machine learning given its investments in Trainium and Inferentia chips as well as the middle layer of the stack in Bedrock and CodeWhisperer.”\n\nAI rises to the top of the CIO's priority list\n\nThe anticipation of increased growth in IT spending for 2024 remains consistent, as reflected in Morgan Stanley’s Q4 CIO survey. Aligned with heightened investor enthusiasm, CIOs have elevated AI and ML to the forefront of their Priority List, with 68% acknowledging its impact on their existing IT budgets.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our 4Q23 CIO survey suggested overall IT spending growth accelerates from 2.6% in 2023 to 3.3% in 2024, but still below the 4.1% 10-year average (preCovid) AI/ML rose to the top of the CIO priority list for the first time, followed by Data Warehousing/Analytics and Security,” analysts said.\n\n“Perhaps most surprisingly, post optimization the percentage of workloads running in the Public Cloud jumped from 29% in our 2Q23 survey to 36% in 4Q23. The percentage of workloads expected to run in the Public Cloud 3 years forward expanded from 46% to 53%.”\n\nMarvell PT raised at BofA\n\nBank of America analysts raised the price target for Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) from $68 to $80 per share.\n\nThis positive revision is grounded in the progress of the custom AI chip ramp. Following discussions with the company's management team during the CES tradeshow in Las Vegas, BofA observed promising trends in cloud AI demand, influencing the decision to raise the price target.\n\n\"Our discussions with NVDA and MRVL were very positive, with both vendors (along with AVGO, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)) supplying critical compute and networking parts to cloud customers,\" said BofA.\n\n\"The MRVL discussion indicated their custom AI chip ramp could be 1.5-2x the $250mn/$450mn we assumed prior for CY24/25E.\"\n\nBaidu primed to be an active AI contributor - Macquarie\n\nMacquarie started coverage of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) with an Outperform rating and set a target price of $150 per share, according to a note released on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts communicated to investors that Baidu's strategic emphasis on its core advertising business is expected to contribute to a stable market share. Furthermore, the company is poised to capitalize on a potential cyclical rebound in advertising budgets, indicating additional room for growth.\n\n\"Baidu has been allocating above-average R&D resources to build a full-stack AI that covers both to-enterprise and to-consumer scenarios,\" added the analysts.\n\n\"While revenue contribution from GenAI remains small at low-single-digit %, we expect Baidu to maintain its leading position in China's AI Cloud market on the back of its strong AI capabilities and improving market recognition.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Alphabet and Amazon attract new Street fans\n\nMedi Assist, Maxposure, New Swan, and Australian Premium Solar set for IPOs\n\nSaudi Arabia stocks lower at close of trade; Tadawul All Share down 0.46%",

        "content": "After falling more than 25% in 2022, the stock market came roaring back in 2023, and history suggests there's more to come. The S&P 500 closed just shy of its all-time high as of market close on Tuesday. When it does finally hit a new record high, that event combined with a more than 20% increase from its recent low will mark the start of the next bull market.\n\nSo why does it matter? Well, since 1957, bull markets on average have lasted nearly five years, rewarding investors with average gains of just over 169%. Going back to the beginning of trading for the Nasdaq Composite in 1972, history shows that in every year following a market recovery, the tech-centric index has generated average annual gains of 19%.\n\nThe economy is generally unpredictable, so things could still get worse before they get better, but the historical data suggests a good year is ahead for investors.\n\nThere are many reasons to buy a stock, and many of them include the expectation that the stock will ultimately make investors money. One of those reasons is a bull market tends to benefit a lot of stocks. Here are my top 10 growth stocks to buy for 2024 before the bull market charges ahead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nA significant decline in digital advertising in 2022 and a pause in the growth of cloud spending hit Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) hard, but the improving economy is sparking a rebound. Google remains the global search leader, the world's largest online advertiser, and a \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure provider, which will continue to buoy its fortunes.\n\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst will be Alphabet's efforts involving artificial intelligence (AI). Alphabet recently rolled out Gemini, a program it claims is the most advanced generative AI system yet. It also offers more than 100 prebuilt AI models via Google Cloud and custom tools to make users more productive.\n\nThis gives Alphabet multiple catalysts to boost its stock in 2024. Trading at 4 times forward sales, the stock is historically cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nEconomic headwinds, led by soaring inflation, weighed heavily on Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2022, but green shoots of growth are appearing across its vast operations. Digital retail is bouncing back, and AI is boosting cloud spending, fueling its two largest growth areas.\n\nThe company has also planted its stake in AI, providing cloud customers with all the top generative AI models via Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company continues to integrate AI into every aspect of its operations, improving productivity along the way.\n\nThe twin tailwinds of an improving economy and AI will drive Alphabet higher. Trading at just 2 times forward sales, the stock is a steal.\n\n3. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) is likely the least well-known company on this list. It's the leading provider of e-commerce and digital payments services in Latin America, and business is brisk. In the third quarter, revenue climbed 69%, while operating income surged 194% -- despite generating record-setting growth last year.\n\nThis trend is expected to continue. The adoption of e-commerce in the region is among the fastest in the world, and with a population of nearly 668 million, it's twice the size of the U.S., so its pool of potential customers is much larger.\n\nAdd to that MercadoLibre's margin expansion and strong cash flow, and investors shouldn't sleep on this Latin American powerhouse.\n\n4. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) suffered from the same headwinds as its tech rivals but responded by kicking off the AI gold rush with a $13 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. What followed was a flurry of activity, integrating generative AI tools across its suite of products and services and AI cloud offerings. Its AI-fueled digital assistant Copilot is seeing robust demand, the headliner in the \"fastest-growing $10 billion business\" in Microsoft's history.\n\nThe demand is unmistakable. Microsoft's Azure cloud revenue growth outpaced rivals in the calendar third quarter, with three percentage points of that growth attributable to demand for AI.\n\nThe stock is selling for 32 times forward earnings, particularly reasonable in light of its prospects.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) processors have long been the gold standard for gaming, data center, and artificial intelligence (AI) use cases, capitalizing on the generative AI boom that hit last year. The resulting shortage of AI chips is expected to persist through 2024. Nvidia ramped up production to meet the accelerating demand and continues pouring money into research and development, creating ever-improving solutions.\n\nThe company has generated triple-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth in each of the past two quarters, and soaring demand for AI is expected to continue. Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 is cheaper than the broader market, making this stock a steal.\n\n6. Palantir Technologies\n\nWith decades of experience under its belt, Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) was ready when AI went viral last year. The company quickly pivoted, adding generative AI models to its repertoire, which work hand in hand with Palantir's AI-powered data analytics. The resulting Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has generated robust interest, and management said, \"Demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past 20 years.\"\n\nThe stock might seem pricey at 11 times forward sales, but with four successive quarters of profitability, Palantir is \"eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500,\" management noted on the company's recent earnings call. As one of the few pure-play AI stocks out there, Palantir is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI gold rush.\n\n7. Roku\n\nDespite a punishing couple of years, Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) remains the world's most widely used streaming platform, with 51% of the market. The dearth of ad spending last year has begun to lift, and with multiple viewers across its 76 million active accounts, it's a compelling opportunity advertisers can't ignore, fueling ad growth on its platform.\n\nFurthermore, the secular tailwinds of cord-cutting and the deterioration of broadcast viewing have caused an ongoing advertising shift from broadcast to streaming. Roku is the one place to reach these highly engaged viewers, who consumed 26.7 billion hours, or roughly 3.9 hours per day. And at roughly 3 times forward sales, investors are getting a bargain.\n\n8. Shopify\n\nWith the downturn largely in the rearview mirror, things are looking up for Shopify(NYSE: SHOP). E-commerce spending has returned to growth, and as the leading provider of software tools for online merchants, Shopify is positioned to thrive. The company released new generative AI tools to help sellers prosper and it has a minority stake in Global-e Online, which helps merchants expand into international markets.\n\nShopify streamlined its operations last year, trimming staff and shedding its logistics business to focus on its mission to empower digital retailers. This has fueled strong growth and profitability, making Shopify a compelling opportunity for investors.\n\n9. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has a reputation as a battleground stock, but it continues to defy detractors. Last year, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car by a comfortable margin, a first for an electric vehicle. Despite headwinds and price adjustments -- which led to temporary profit declines -- the company continued to drive further into the automotive mainstream.\n\nWith inflation cooling and interest rates expected to drop next year, conditions will be much more favorable for Tesla. This could help the company return to its long-term production goal of 50% annual growth while also helping expand its profit margins.\n\nFinally, 5 times forward sales is a pretty reasonable valuation, especially considering the stock price gains of more than 2,300% over the past decade.\n\n10. The Trade Desk\n\nSome investors were surprised by the impact the aforementioned decline in marketing spending in 2022 had on The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD). The company's self-service digital advertising platform actually took market share from the walled gardens, including Alphabet and Meta Platforms, notching growth even as its rivals suffered year-over-year revenue declines.\n\nLate last year, CEO Jeff Green said, \"Over the last few quarters ... we have gained more market share than in any other period in our company's history.\" The Trade Desk's recently released Koa AI copilot should fuel this trend, helping advertisers get the most out of their ad campaigns.\n\nFinally, with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the standard for an underpriced stock -- the Trade Desk is a compelling bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy for the Green Revolution",
        "content": "Renewable energy stocks had a rough year in 2023. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN), which holds some 135 different clean energy public companies, fell more than 20% in 2023. Similarly, the Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS), which holds about 54 different solar names, plummeted 35.1%. Renewable energy companies had not convinced equities traders and investors that they were worth investing in last year, especially as U.S. oil and gas prices continued to hit new lows.\n\nNonetheless, we have come upon a new year, and interest rate cuts are likely so 2024 could be a breakout year for a number of clean energy stocks. Below are three that investors should consider for the oncoming Green Revolution.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite investor sentiment souring on clean energy stocks in 2023, solar panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) was able to consecutively increase earnings while growing revenue by double-digit percentage points. First Solar also made gains on the manufacturing front with an announcement of a new $1.1 billion manufacturing site Louisiana, U.S. and a signed 15-year PPA that will guarantee power to a new manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, First Solar has generated $3.2 billion in revenue on an LTM basis and, perhaps most importantly, the company is profitable with a 15% net margin over the last 12 months. Shares in First Solar returned just over 15% in 2023 and maintained volatility throughout that year. The stock currently trades at 14.3x forward earnings, which could be a good valuation to lock in as interest rates are projected to decrease in the latter half of 2024. First Solar is a manufacturer at firs. Therefore, the company partially relies on access to debt capital to get manufacturing facilities up and running.\n\nLower interest rates and government support from the Inflation Reduction Act of August 2022 could help First Solar expand its business footprint in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is the largest supplier of liquid hydrogen and the company produces hydrogen fuel cells for mobility applications. Many of Plug Power’s hydrogen fuel cells service supply chain and logistics industries. Companies within these sectors may want to decrease their carbon footprint and some go about this by deploying hydrogen-powered forklifts, trucks, buses and drones. Plug Power’s fuel cells are key to this. The hydrogen fuel cell developer has successfully formed several strategic partnerships with major players in the mobility and logistics sector. This includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY).\n\nPlug Power’s shares dropped 63.6% by the end of 2023, and the selling off pressure the ensued in the new year has caused the company’s valuation to trade at just 1.5x forward sales. In a recent interview, Plug Power’s CEO said he expected hydrogen tax rules, currently being proposed by the Biden Administration, to loosen before their implementation. If correct, this could help save the company millions in the long run. These attractive future prospects and the company’s currently cheap trading multiple should pique investors interest here.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the dominant players in the global electric vehicle market. The automaker has been also playing an influential role in creating the basic infrastructure for electric vehicle charging, ultimately tackling the EV market from different angles.\n\nThroughout 2023, Tesla defied skeptics broke records. In particular, Tesla’s quarterly earnings have come in above analysts’ estimates, and the price-cut strategy the automaker began to pursue in the beginning year has increased quarterly deliveries while also placing pressure on gross margins. Delivery numbers for Q4 2023 were released a week ago and continued to be solid. The automaker delivered 483,507 vehicles during the last three months of last year, beating Wall Street estimates. Despite growing competition from China’s BYD and fears that EV demand in Tesla’s geographic end-markets may be waning, Tesla remains a good for those wanting to allocate to renewable energy companies.\n\nTesla will likely remain not just relevant but also a key player in the space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the16 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.\n\nLatest data shows that more and more Americans are investing in stocks, a trend that started during the COVID-19 pandemic days. In December, a Wall Street Journal report cited data from the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances which said that about 58% of U.S. households owned stocks in 2022, up from 53% in 2019. This was the highest household stock-ownership rate recorded in the survey that is conducted after every three years. This data shows that the rise of individual investors seen after the pandemic was not a temporary trend. As millions of Americans received stimulus checks during the pandemic days, they turned to retail investing platforms like Robinhood and other investing apps to pile into stocks. That trend is still going on despite the massive decline in stocks seen in 2022 following the inflation storm and rate hikes.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we used Robinhood Investor Index (which shows the most popular stocks on the investing platform Robinhood), some research reports and screeners highlighting the most popular stocks among individual investors to find out 16 most widely held stocks among individual investors. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals\n\nPhoto by Chris Liverani on Unsplash\n\n16. Sphere 3D Corp (NASDAQ:ANY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 1\n\nSphere 3D Corp (NASDAQ:ANY) is one of the most popular stocks among individual investors, according to Fintel Retail Ownership stock screener. The carbon neutral bitcoin mining company Sphere 3D Corp (NASDAQ:ANY) said it mined 73.5 bitcoins in December, higher than 71.7 bitcoins mined in November and 17.9 bitcoins in the year-ago month.\n\n15. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 9\n\nMany data platforms tracking retail investor activity show GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) continues to be one of the most widely held stocks by individual investors. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) has fallen from its glory days when it skyrocketed thanks to the short squeeze launched by retail investors on Reddit. The stock has lost about 14% in value over the past one year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.00, beating estimates by $0.08. Revenue in the quarter fell 9.2% year over year to $1.08 billion, missing estimates by $100 million.\n\nIn addition to stocks like GameStop, individual investors are also buying mega-cap tech stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\n14. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) ranks 14th in our list of the stocks widely held by individual investors. In November, the entertainment company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) posted strong third quarter results thanks to Barbie and Oppenheimer.\n\nAdjusted EPS in the quarter came in at -$0.09, beating estimates by $0.16. Revenue in the period jumped 45.2% year over year to $1.41 billion, beating estimates by $150 million.\n\n13. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nChinese EV company Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) ranks 13th in our list of the stocks widely held by individuals. According to data from Robinhood, Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) is amongst the most popular stocks on the platform.\n\nEarlier this month, BofA Securities downgraded the stock to Neutral. BofA said lack of new models in the first half of 2024 will affect company sales.\n\n12. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) is one of the most popular stocks among retail investors. Hedge fund sentiment for the automaker also inched up in the third quarter of 2023, as 43 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F), up from 40 hedge funds in the previous quarter.\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) sold 25,937 electric cars in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was up 24% on a YoY basis.\n\n11. Invesco QQQ ETF\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nInvesco QQQ ETF tracks the NASDAQ-100 index and gives investors exposure to some of the top technology and growth stocks. Over the past few years it has become one of the most famous ETFs among individual investors.\n\n10. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains one of the most favorite stocks of individual investors. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) produced 494,989 vehicles and delivered over 484,507 vehicles, beating estimates of 483,000 deliveries.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). The most notable stakeholder of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was Catherine D. Wood's ARK Investment Management which owns a stake worth over $1 billion.\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it's relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.\"\n\n9. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 82\n\nThere has been an increase in popularity of broader market ETFs and index funds among individual investors especially after the inflation storm and rate hikes.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is among the most held ETFs by individual investors.\n\n8. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 89\n\nAccording to Robinhood index tracker, Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most popular stocks on the Robinhood platform.\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) has been seeing a lot of activity in the hedge fund space as it prepares to enter a battle with Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners. Peltz is seeking two board seats at Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS).\n\nActivist hedge fund Blackwells Capital will nominate three directors to Walt Disney Co’s (NYSE:DIS) board in support of Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and ValueAct Capital Management recently entered an agreement according to which Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) will provide information to the investment firm and consult with ValueAct on strategic matters, including through meetings with the Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) Board and management.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).  The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.\"\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has made a comeback against NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) by launching new chips for AI and the company plans to continue to up its AI game.\n\nWells Fargo analysts led by Aaron Rakers earlier this month said in a note that they like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the current levels as they believe the semiconductor industry is set for a rebound.\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD's data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company's AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD's product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD's inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock's strong performance run, led us to trim the position.\"\n\n6. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 180\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has seen a huge rise in popularity among retail and institutional investors amid the AI boom. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 234% over the past one year, with many analysts repeatedly saying there’s a lot more room to run for the stock because of a burgeoning demand for AI chips.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, hedge funds and retail investors are piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\n\n\"Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those three stocks, as well as Microsoft, were among the leading contributors to Strategy performance for the quarter. Microsoft and Nvidia continued to be supported by strong execution and leadership positions in the implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThese are high-quality, cash flow generative businesses that we will continue to own, actively adjusting our positioning sizes based on risk/reward and portfolio construction priorities. With Nvidia shares more than tripling in 2023, we opportunistically took profits throughout the year, an approach that continued in the fourth quarter with additional trims that brought the position down to 6% of overall assets.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.\"\n\nClick to continue reading and see 16 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Analysts 11 Most Promising Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks According to Analysts 16 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 41% and 111% in 2024, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Data centers are physical locations where companies keep computing infrastructure like servers, network equipment, and data storage solutions. They come in different shapes and sizes, but cloud data centers have become particularly popular over the last decade. Cloud computing allows businesses to provision hardware and software services instantly, without spending a lot of money upfront.\n\nCountless companies have capitalized on that IT reshuffling, but few have benefited more than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Nvidia chips have become key data center accelerators for workloads like artificial intelligence (AI), and Amazon is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services. Critical positioning in a booming industry drove both stocks higher. Nvidia returned 12,800% during the last decade and Amazon returned 630%.\n\nThat substantial price appreciation led both companies to split their stocks somewhat recently:\n\nNvidia: 4-for-1 split July 2021. Amazon: 20-for-1 split in June 2022.\n\nCertain Wall Street analysts see big gains for shareholders in 2024. Specifically, Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt has a 12-month price target on Nvidia of $1,100 per share, implying a 111% upside from its current price. Similarly, Scott Devitt at Wedbush Securities has a 12-month price target on Amazon of $210 per share, implying a 41% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has three primary growth engines in its gaming, professional visualization, and data center businesses, though the automotive segment could become a substantial source of revenue as the robotaxi market blossoms.\n\nNvidia has deep roots in gaming and professional visualization. Its invention of the GPU (graphics processing unit) in 1999 revolutionized computer graphics, and the company still holds more than 90% market share in workstation graphics processors. But Nvidia also added monetization opportunities by branching into software with Omniverse, a suite of applications that support 3D design and virtual simulation. The latter is useful in training machine learning models for autonomous robots and self-driving cars.\n\nStory continues\n\nGuided by visionary CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia moved into data centers in 2006 when it introduced the CUDA programming model, turning its GPUs into general-purpose processors. That innovation laid the foundation for tremendous success. Today, Nvidia dominates the market for data center accelerators and machine learning chips. In fact, Forrester Research has said Nvidia GPUs are synonymous with AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann highlighted adjacent AI monetization opportunities in data center networking and software. To elaborate, networking sales tripled over the past year to become a $10 billion business, and CEO Jensen Huang says it will get much larger. Similarly, CFO Colette Kress says Nvidia started to see excellent adoption of AI software during the most recent quarter, an encouraging update, given that management sees it as a $150 billion market opportunity.\n\nHere's the bottom line: GPU sales are projected to increase by 28% annually through 2030, while the AI market is projected to expand by 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at 25% annual sales growth through the end of the decade. Despite that, its present valuation of 29 times sales looks a little pricey, especially when the three-year average is 23.5 times sales.\n\nInvestors comfortable with volatility can buy a small position today, provided they are willing to hold the stock for at least five years. The triple-digit return baked into Rosenblatt's 12-month price target is unlikely, given the elevated valuation, but it is possible over a five-year time period.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has three main growth engines: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. The first two opportunities are interconnected. Specifically, Amazon operates the most-visited online marketplace on the planet, and eMarketer says the platform accounted for 38.7% of retail e-commerce sales across North America and Western Europe last year.\n\nThat scale means Amazon is uniquely positioned to engage shoppers and source data from its marketplace, and the company has leveraged that advantage to build a booming advertising business. In fact, Amazon recently became the third-largest ad tech company in the world. And its recent decision to bring ads to Prime Video adds yet another opportunity.\n\nNot surprisingly, Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Devitt is particularly bullish on Amazon's ad tech business, and he recently wrote: \"The company is well positioned to continue taking share of global digital advertising spending over a multi-year period.\" But Devitt is also optimistic about the cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), where he believes growth will accelerate in 2024.\n\nWhether that happens or not, AWS is indeed primed for long-term growth as the AI boom unfolds. Consultancy Gartner has recognized its leadership in cloud AI developer services, and AWS recently extended its portfolio with the launch of Bedrock and Amazon Q. The former is a development platform for generative AI applications, and the latter is a generative AI business assistant. Both could help AWS tap the growing demand for generative AI software, a market Bloomberg believes will grow at 69% annually through 2032.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Retail e-commerce sales are projected to increase at 8% annually through 2030, while the ad tech and cloud computing markets are forecast to grow at 14% annually during the same period. Amazon will likely split the difference, meaning annual sales growth could range from 10% to 12% through the end of the decade. That estimate leaves room for upside should Amazon be especially successful in its AI ambitions.\n\nIn either case, its current valuation of 2.8 times sales looks quite reasonable, especially when the three-year average is 3 times sales. Patient investors should consider buying a small position today, but the key word is patient. The 41% upside baked into Wedbush's 12-month price target seems a bit too optimistic, but Amazon could certainly beat the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks With Up to 50% Upside in 2024, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Stock splits shouldn't be the primary reason to consider buying a stock. But it's no surprise that many of the most popular stocks investors and Wall Street pros follow are those of successful companies that have a history of delivering superior returns for shareholders, and therefore, occasionally issue stock splits to keep their share prices affordable for individual investors.\n\nWhile AI stocks are getting a lot of attention on Wall Street right now, investors need to be careful about overplaying their hand in one area of the market. There are plenty of analysts still making bullish calls on leading consumer brands that are reporting solid growth and have attractive upside potential in 2024 and beyond.\n\nWall Street pros see more gains in the year ahead for Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH), and Nike(NYSE: NKE) -- three amazing companies that have a history of splitting their shares. Three Motley Fool contributors will explain what is driving these companies' growth and why now is a good time to buy shares.\n\nThe economy is making a comeback, and Amazon is poised to win\n\nJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon split its stock in 2022, when the price tag was over $2,000. The move was the first in over 20 years, but the 20-for-1 split reflected the stock price's massive growth over that period. It's returned about 24% since its most recent split.\n\nAmazon faced pressure across several segments over the past few years, but it looks like it's emerging in excellent shape. It has maintained a strong lead over competitors in e-commerce and cloud computing, and after a net loss in 2022, net income is rising again. It tripled year over year in the 2023 third quarter. E-commerce is back to strong growth, outpacing overall retail growth. Amazon has also focused on becoming more efficient, restructuring its distribution network and cutting jobs. As inflation eases and people go back to spending, Amazon is well positioned to benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud services division, has seen decelerating sales growth as some customers cut their budgets. Management said there are indications that the trend is reversing, and clients are starting to expand their usage again.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) could play an outsize role in Amazon's ability to outperform in 2024 and beyond. It recently launched several powerful AI tools for AWS, and it's using AI in e-commerce and its advertising business. Advertising continues to be a strong growth generator, with sales increasing 26% over last year in the 2023 third quarter, as compared with 13% for the whole company.\n\nAmazon shares gained 81% in 2023, but they're still 18% below their all-time highs. The consensus analyst estimate is for Amazon stock to rise 17% over the next 12 to 18 months, with a high of 50% and a low of a negative 9% return. If Amazon delivers a strong performance in 2024, there's every chance that it can meet and surpass even the highest estimate.\n\nA rising beverage brand with global growth potential\n\nJohn Ballard (Celsius Holdings): Shares of this energy drink maker have returned over 4,500% over the last five years. The rapid ascent in its stock price caused the company to issue a 3-for-1 stock split in November. This business is just getting started on a long road of massive growth.\n\nIn Celsius' third-quarter business update, the company credited its 104% year-over-year growth in revenue to increasing availability of its products and brand awareness. This is the result of a long-term deal with PepsiCo to use the beverage giant's extensive distribution network to sell its products -- a major advantage for an up-and-coming consumer goods brand.\n\nAnalyst Vivien Azer from TD Cowen has set an $83 price target on the stock, representing 41% upside from Celsius' current share price. Azer sees the launch in Canada in the first quarter as another growth opportunity to keep the company's momentum going in the new year.\n\nThe share trade at a high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 56, but as Celsius expands beyond the U.S., the added sales volume could significantly boost the company's profits and justify the stock's lofty P/E. Over the next five years, analysts expect Celsius to grow earnings by 55% per year.\n\nIdentifying top consumer brands while they're small can be a rewarding investment strategy. Celsius looks like an ideal candidate for investors interested in finding these opportunities.\n\nA classic blue chip play\n\nJeremy Bowman (Nike): Few stocks have a stronger track record than Nike. The sportswear giant has dominated its industry for more than a generation, and while it's struggled with the broader headwinds in the apparel sector and discretionary spending recently, the company still looks well positioned for long-term growth.\n\nNike also has a long history of splitting its stock, executing seven 2-for-1 stock splits since its initial public offering in 1980. In other words, if you owned 1 share of the stock back then, you would have 128 today.\n\nNike's last stock split came at the end of 2015, and since then, the shares are up 61%, so it may be premature to expect the company to split its stock again right now.\n\nHowever, Wall Street is optimistic about the company. The average analyst expects Nike shares to gain 19% this year, which makes it the Dow Jones stock that analysts are most bullish on after Disney. Of the 30 analysts covering the stock, 20 rate it a buy, nine call it a hold, and one rates it a sell.\n\nThere's a good reason why Wall Street is so confident in the Swoosh. Nike stock is trading down 42% from its peak in 2021 due to slow growth and the broader demand headwinds it's facing. However, the company demonstrated its ability to squeeze more profits out of its business. In its most recent quarter, earnings per share jumped 21% to $1.03 even as revenue was up just 1%. It improved gross margin by 170 basis points as the company lowered its inventory by 14%, and it should benefit from that trend in the coming quarters.\n\nThat, combined with an expected economic recovery and the help of lower interest rates, should push the shares higher this year, even if another stock split doesn't appear imminent.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Amazon made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 8, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and Top 11 Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and His Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nJim Cramer kicked off 2024 with an observation that the market might be undergoing a rotation where investors are taking profits from major mega-cap tech stocks and pouring these profits into the laggards of 2023 like banks, healthcare and consumer companies.\n\nWhat Jim Cramer's 'Crystal Ball' Says About 2024\n\nJim Cramer said that according to his \"crystal ball,\" investors this year would take profits selling \"best of the best\" and invest in companies that \"haven’t gotten respect for ages.\" By best of the best Cramer meant the Magnificent Seven group of stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  and \"richly valued\" software companies.\n\nCramer talked about his early days in the Wall Street where the beginning of every new year would bring excitement and enthusiasm among investors that caused \"repositioning\" in the market. Cramer said that most of the times this repositioning is temporary and does not have a lot of importance in the long run. Cramer said that some circles believe the Magnificent Seven group of stocks won't be able to sustain their rally. Cramer said he reluctantly agrees with this notion but long-term investors should approach these sell-offs as buying opportunities.\n\n\"A Heck With These Traders\"\n\nCramer predicted that 2024 markets would be defined by what the Fed does about inflation as traders will keep looking over their shoulder for the next inflation report and Jerome Powell's comments. But Cramer advised his viewers to \"don’t be one of those people,\" referring to investors who impulsively react to any \"utterances\" from the Fed, traders, economists or politicians about the stock market.\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer expressed his frustration with this short-term, reactive investing approach and said:\n\n\"Me? I say a heck with these traders.\"\n\nCramer Says AI and Software Bubbles Will be Popped\n\nJim Cramer said during beginning of every new year investors usually sell stocks that perform extremely well in the previous year and invest their money into beaten down stocks. But that trend changes after earnings season begins and investors come back to top performers of the previous year. Jim Cramer predicted that the artificial intelligence and enterprises software \"bubbles will be popped.\" But once these stocks come back to reasonable valuations compared to other stocks they will once again be bought, Cramer thinks.\n\nJim Cramer went through different sectors to weigh options for investors. For the healthcare sector, Cramer said \"no thank you\" since he believes healthcare stocks do not perform well during election years. For retail, Cramer said these companies are \"finally getting their arms around the shoplifting problem\" and could produce better returns. For the oil industry, Cramer said \"very difficult\" since \"we produce so much crude in this country\" that it's hard for oil prices to go higher.\n\nWait for the Sell-Off and Then Do \"Some Buying\"\n\nJim Cramer said he told his investing club members that they'll be \"rewarded\" if they bought stocks with decent valuations, not dramatically expensive when compared to average S&P 500 multiples. Cramer said investors should be patient and wait for the sell-off he's expecting and then do \"some buying.\" Jim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and Top 10 Stock Picks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC during early January and picked 11 stocks he's bullish on.\n\n11. Symbotic Inc (NASDAQ:SYM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nTalking about robotics warehouse automation company Symbotic Inc (NASDAQ:SYM), Jim Cramer recently said during his program that he likes \"real AI\" that helps companies make money and not the AI that is just for press releases.

(NYSE:MODG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Slipping by -30% were the shares of Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (NYSE:MODG), which manufactures golf equipment and accessories, as well as operates entertainment venues. Revenues were shy of expectations because recent wildfires in Canada led to temporary closures of Topgolf locations there. However, the company’s equipment sales showed larger-than-expected volumes and recent golf industry data indicated higher activity levels.”\n\n8. Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nAnswering a question about Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM), Jim Cramer recently said that Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) CEO Rene Haas is doing a \"fantastic job.\" Cramer said some circles have sounded skepticism around the stock amid weakness  in cell phone and PC business.\n\nCramer said that this company is doing \"so much so right, they are going to dominate cell phone, PC, hyperscale.\"\n\nCramer said he'd want to buy Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) for his charitable trust.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) doing this period was\n\n7. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nEarlier this month, Jim Cramer called GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) a \"ridiculously cheap\" stock. Cramer said GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) is doing \"so many great things.\" The analyst also said that when the stock was at $66 \"a guy\" downgraded the stock but Cramer said he'd recommended \"Buy, Buy, Buy\" on the stock.\n\nCramer also said that his Charitable Trust has a \"big position\" in the stock and he's sticking with the GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) stock for the \"long haul.\"\n\nA total of 41 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC).\n\nSound Shore Management made the following comment about GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“That said, current macro factors of higher inflation, rising rates, and a slowing economy are affecting stock prices in the short-term. Against this backdrop, many consumer stocks and financing-based business models declined in the third quarter. For example, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) was our largest detractor for the period. A recent spinout from GE, the company is the world’s largest medical imaging supplier with steady growth and higher margins. We purchased the stock in the first quarter of 2023 when it was trading at 14 times normalized earnings, a significant discount to peers. Our research concluded that GEHC’s profit margins were temporarily depressed due to the spinoff and one-time Research & Development charges, and that management’s plan for improvement was credible. The stock got off to a strong start early in the year, but returned the bulk of its gains as higher borrowing rates for their customers created demand uncertainty. As well, 15% of GE Healthcare’s business is from China, where demand has slowed along with the economy. We view these headwinds as temporary, and added to our position during the stock’s recent pullback.”\n\n6. Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nJim Cramer was excited about aerospace-related engineering services company Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) recently.

        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Amazon.com’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Amazon.com?\n\nGreat news for investors – Amazon.com is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $198.94, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Amazon.com’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of Amazon.com look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Amazon.com's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since AMZN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy AMZN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Amazon.com from their most recent forecasts.

Until now.\n\nThe Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apple’s closely guarded ecosystem.

The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.\n\nStill, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.\n\nThreatening the 'walled garden'\n\nApple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.\n\nApple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.\n\nBut the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.\n\nStory continues\n\nA DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.\n\nBut Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nEdel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position.

(Loren Elliott/REUTERS/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nApple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to reign in Big Tech.\n\n\"The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,\" Edel said.\n\nUniversity of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.\n\nFor one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.\n\n\"If I were Apple, I’d be pretty worried about this,\" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the world’s top antitrust litigators in-house. The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after its unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCritics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.\n\nThe company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.\n\nInteroperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.\n\nThe Epic effect\n\nThere are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.\n\nOne is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.\n\nIn that case, the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.\n\nHowever, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.\n\nApple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which has yet to say whether it will hear the case. What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit, Newman said, would depend on where the department chose to file its case. \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games' chief executive Tim Sweeney leaves after a weekslong antitrust trial at federal court in Oakland, Calif, in 2021. (Brittany Hosea-Small/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\"They could take the fight to Apple’s doorstep, but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case,\" Newman said. \"DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.\"\n\nGoogle's battle\n\nThe second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.\n\nClosing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.\n\nThe lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.\n\nIf the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.\n\nThose talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The 3 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for 10 Years",
        "content": "Follow the leader. It's a game most of us played as kids. And it just might be a good investing strategy for adults.\n\nWhen we think of leaders in the world of investing, one name stands out above all others: Warren Buffett. He has managed to achieve staggering cumulative gains over his long career.\n\nHis portfolio offers several great ideas for long-term investors today. Here are my picks for the three best Buffett stocks to buy and hold for 10 years (listed in alphabetical order).\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't one of Buffett's largest positions. He didn't even make the initial call to add the stock to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. However, I predict that Amazon will be one of the legendary investor's biggest winners over the next decade.\n\nThroughout much of Amazon's history, the company's management didn't worry too much about the bottom line. It focused on reinvesting profits to fuel future growth.\n\nAmazon is still investing heavily in growth, but its executives are also now working hard to boost profitability. I expect this focus will continue to pay off.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) should provide a massive tailwind for Amazon over the next 10 years and beyond. The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform stands to benefit tremendously as organizations build generative AI apps in the cloud. The company's e-commerce and advertising businesses should also be more profitable as a result of using AI.\n\nI also like that Amazon continually looks at opportunities to expand into new arenas. The company's decision to sell cars online beginning in 2024 is a good example of this. I look for Amazon to move into other new businesses in the years to come.\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nYou might think I'm cheating a bit, but I couldn't leave Berkshire Hathaway off the list. After all, it's the stock that Buffett is personally invested in the most.\n\nProbably my favorite thing about Berkshire Hathaway is the diversification it provides. The holding company has more than 60 subsidiaries that span multiple industries. It also owns positions in more than 40 other publicly traded companies. Buying shares of Berkshire is almost like investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire's core businesses, including its insurance and energy operations, should perform well over the long term. While I'm not a fan of every stock in the conglomerate's investment portfolio, I think most of them should deliver solid returns over the next 10 years.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern about Berkshire is that Buffett could have health problems, and the stock could suffer, as a result. The good news is that he seems to be in great shape right now. More importantly, though, Berkshire has highly capable executives and investment managers who are already involved in running the company.\n\n3. Mastercard\n\nAmazon and Berkshire Hathaway were relatively easy picks for me as top Buffett stocks to buy and hold for 10 years. The third was tougher, but I ultimately chose Mastercard(NYSE: MA).\n\nLike Buffett, I prioritize business moats when choosing stocks to own for the long haul. Mastercard claims several strong moats, including network effects, economies of scale, and its brand.\n\nI expect that e-commerce will make up a much higher percentage of retail sales in the future. The increased adoption of digital payments is an unstoppable trend. Both should directly benefit Mastercard.\n\nThe growth of middle classes in emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is another key trend that works in Mastercard's favor. This middle-class expansion is likely to boost e-commerce, digital payments, and credit card use even more.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 8, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Outperform in 2024: 1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Now and Hold Through the Surge",
        "content": "The past couple of years have been dramatic for growth stock investors. The Nasdaq Composite index, which is chock-full of growth stocks, tanked by 33% in 2022. The growth-stock-laden index recovered in a big way last year with a 43% gain.\n\nLast year was the 11th time since 1971 that the Nasdaq Composite index returned to positive gains following a negative year. All recoveries have lasted at least two years. The second year of Nasdaq Composite index recoveries are generally less dramatic than the first year but are still significant.\n\nDuring the second year of the past 10 recoveries, the Nasdaq Composite index has gained 21.8% on average. That doesn't necessarily mean growth stocks in the Nasdaq Composite will have another great year in 2024, but it sure seems likely. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn recent years, everyday investors have become enamored with stock-split stocks. In theory, stock splits don't affect a company's overall market value. They only make it easier for folks with smaller budgets to buy shares.\n\nIn practice, investors view stock splits as a sign of confidence from the businesses that announce them. They also remind investors about extended periods of strong performance that pushed the stock high enough to warrant a split in the first place.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a high-flying stock that split each of its shares into 20 new ones in June 2022. Despite already rising 63% over the past year, a Nasdaq bull market could propel it to new heights in 2024.\n\nWhy Amazon stock is a buy right now\n\nMicrosoft may have beaten Amazon to the punch by investing early in OpenAI and its hyper-popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) service, ChatGPT. That doesn't mean Amazon's behind the ball when it comes to implementing new AI services for the enormous base of customers who subscribe to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Staying ahead of the curve is a big reason AWS is the world's largest provider of cloud services.\n\nAmazon is working on a pair of relatively low-cost chips for training and inference from large language models (LLM), plus it offers access to top-of-the-line chips from Nvidia. This flexibility inspired Anthropic, a leading LLM maker, to hire AWS as its primary cloud provider last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFew organizations want their content to become part of an LLM that their competitors can access. Amazon Bedrock solves this problem by letting clients customize existing LLMs with proprietary data in a secure setting.\n\nBoosting AI functionality helped push AWS sales 13% higher during the first nine months of 2023, and it isn't the only operating segment pushing the needle forward. Amazon's e-commerce business is growing fast and will likely continue along its trajectory for a long time.\n\nAmazon reported e-commerce sales that rose 11% during the first nine months of 2023. At $247 billion, there's still plenty of room to keep growing. The global e-commerce market was valued at $13.5 trillion in 2022 and is projected to grow by 15% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.\n\nBusinesses ordering goods from other businesses will be responsible for the majority of e-commerce sales and growth in the years ahead. During the pandemic, Amazon doubled the size of its already enormous fulfillment network. With more nodes and connections than any of its competitors, business-oriented sellers in North America will be hard-pressed to find better options.\n\nAmazon's ad sales are pushing up profits\n\nAmazon is leveraging the popularity of its e-commerce platform with ad sales that are climbing fast. Sellers spent $12.1 billion on ads in the third quarter, 25% more than they spent a year earlier.\n\nHigh-margin ad sales helped Amazon generate $21.4 billion in free cash flow during the 12 months ended Sep. 30, 2023. This is a sharp improvement from the previous year's losses, but 33% below the peak reached in 2020.\n\nAmazon shares are richly valued at roughly 95 times trailing free cash flow, about 53 times the free cash flow generated in 2020. Before piling into this stock, it's important to realize it could fall hard if profits don't continue along the upward trajectory they've been on since 2022.\n\nCloud customers flocking to AWS and sellers locked into its unmatched e-commerce platform are what Amazon needs to raise its bottom line to new heights. E-commerce and cloud services are such large markets that this business can grow into its lofty valuation. That said, risk-averse investors who can't stomach any losses want to keep looking for safer stocks to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Berkshire Hathaway Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway have made a name for themselves as some of the best investors ever. As a result, the company has gained a significant following that likes to imitate its trades.\n\nWhile no one should just follow anyone's moves in the stock market unquestioningly, it's useful to look at what Berkshire owns to understand what management thinks will be a winning investment. After doing that, I've spotted two companies investors can buy confidently, and one they should avoid.\n\nVisa\n\nBuffett is a huge fan of toll-booth-style companies. The business model is fairly simple: Create an infrastructure and take a bit of revenue from everything that passes through it. Perhaps one of the greatest toll-booth model businesses of all time is Visa's (NYSE: V) payment processing infrastructure.\n\nEvery time a Visa-branded card is swiped, the company collects a small fee for using its network -- and it adds up. This has been incredibly profitable, with Visa consistently posting some of the highest profit margins of any company. V Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFew companies can transform more than half of every dollar in revenue into net profit, but that's what Visa does. Furthermore, Visa is still posting solid growth despite being as large as it is. In Visa's fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), its revenue rose 11% to $8.6 billion -- a new record high.\n\nDespite its top-tier business model and strong growth, Visa trades at 32 times trailing earnings and 27 times forward earnings -- some of the lowest levels investors have seen during the past five years. This creates a strong buying opportunity, and while Berkshire may not consider the stock cheap here, it still looks like a bargain from a long-term perspective.\n\nAmazon\n\nAlthough Berkshire doesn't own much Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock, it is a great buy now. Amazon's business has dramatically improved under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder Jassy, Amazon has discovered something that eluded Bezos-led Amazon: Consistent and growing profit. Amazon has been focused on improving its profitability lately, which showed up in 2023. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon's revenue growth has also bounced back, rising 13% in the third quarter. Amazon is a company that's firing on all cylinders right now, and even though Berkshire Hathaway reduced its position in Q3, I think Amazon is a great buy right now.\n\nApple\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is undoubtedly Buffett's and Berkshire's favorite stock. It makes up nearly half of Berkshire's portfolio (currently about 47%).\n\nHowever, this could be an issue in 2024.\n\nWhile Apple's stock did well in 2023 (it rose 48%), the business struggled.\n\nApple reported declining revenue every quarter in FY 2023 (ended Sept. 30). This weakness wasn't limited to just one product line, and iPhones, Macs, and iPads all struggled during various times of the year.\n\nWhen a company struggles, yet the stock doesn't budge or rises, this is a tell-tale sign of overoptimism. This can lead to a bubble and cause serious losses when it bursts. While I don't think Apple is in a bubble quite yet, it's valued at 32 times trailing earnings and 29 times forward earnings estimates -- an expensive price tag for a shrinking company.\n\nSo, while Apple may be Berkshire's favorite stock, it's far from a buy right now. The other two companies above are in a much better place than Apple, so investors should look to those if they're trying to stick with Berkshire-owned stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

Welcome to Good Buy or Goodbye. Our goal, to help cut through that noise and navigate the best moves for your portfolio.\n\nToday, we're diving into the Magnificent Seven. And while the mega-cap effect powered last year's returns for markets, with a new year comes a new perspective. So what's the best way to play it now? I am here with Ray Wang. He is the Constellation Research founder and principal analyst.\n\nAnd Ray, your buy is on Amazon. First of all, give that away. And then you have a couple of reasons to support your claim. What is your bullish case here?\n\nRAY WANG: Yeah, my bull case is because the run up isn't in on Amazon. But we're looking at Amazon versus Microsoft. And when you think about what's going on here, right, Amazon has been doing amazing.\n\nAnd the first one is really they're done making the investment, right? They've done $200 billion of investments in capital. That means the free cash flow has been really bad, but we're now on the other end of that. And when we look at that, you're going to see the ability for them to actually put that free cash flow to use. Not just online profits, acquisitions, reinvestment, but more importantly, you're going to see that in profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nJARED BLIKRE: All right--\n\nRAY WANG: And you're going to see that in the--\n\nJARED BLIKRE: I want to hold it right there because I actually have a chart of free cash flow. This is the actual in cyan here versus the estimate this goes back to 2014, so about 10 years. You can see the estimates got a little bit out of touch with reality, came down.\n\nThey met reality, it went below. And now it's off to the moon. So this is kind of what you're talking about here.\n\nRAY WANG: Exactly and that's where we're going to see a lot of those gains.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: OK, great. We also have, as another potential risk here-- or excuse me, another potential bullish risk, most diversified streams of digital monetization. So they're finally going down that path of monetizing more in different ways. Can you tell us how?\n\nRAY WANG: Well, so here's the beauty of it, right? It's ads, goods, search, services, memberships, and subscriptions. Well, think about it, the number three player in ads is Amazon out of nowhere.\n\nFive years ago, you wouldn't be talking about Amazon in ads. And of course, we know they're in goods, they're in memberships, subscriptions, and services, and they've done a killer job there. They're the only one of the Magnificent Seven that have all six of those digital monetization models.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, and we're also taking a look-- you are-- at AI. And you're just coming from CES. We'll talk about that in another segment, but AI is the thing over the last year. Automation not priced into the base case. How does-- how does that work for Amazon?\n\nRAY WANG: And so here's the interesting point, all the AI that we tend to think about with NVIDIA, with Microsoft, with Google, actually Amazon has a lot of it. Not just in AWS, but they're putting it to use in commerce. And if you've ever seen one of their warehouses, there's a lot going on in the background with automation. That is actually going to give them more leverage than most people are seeing right now.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, easy to forget how big they are in logistics. Anyway, we got to go to some of the risks here and one of those is regulatory. We've heard the DOJ and antitrust concerns kind of coming up in recent years. What about that front?\n\nRAY WANG: I'm worried about DOJ. If we have the same administration going into the next election out of 2025, there's going to be huge regulatory issues coming out of FTC, DOJ. If we have a change in leadership, then I would take that risk off the table. Right now, I'm betting that the risk off the table, it's like a 50/50. Nobody knows where it's going to head.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I'd say pretty fair with that. We don't know where that's going to go. We got to talk about Microsoft here, one stock to avoid. Are we saying goodbye here?\n\nRAY WANG: I'm saying goodbye only because the run up has already been there. For a lot of people, they've invested in Microsoft, it's been an amazing ride. Satya is an amazing CEO.\n\nBut here's some of the challenges, right? One of them right now is when you think about it, massive competition in AI. Microsoft started a war with Google last January that they thought they were going to win because they thought they caught Google flat footed. The answer is Google kicked back and they kicked back really hard.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, and we're also taking a look at valuation. You just said pretty much that they run up. They got a lot of price increase last year. Do you think that's it for them?\n\nRAY WANG: No, there's still a little bit more. And they may be the most valuable company in the world for another five, six months, but at that point the question is, what's next? And every investor asks, will they be able to deliver on what's next?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, and then quality complaints. Where is that coming from?\n\nRAY WANG: If you've been on a Teams call recently, you know how shoddy that is. If you're asking for more capacity in the Western region, customers are not getting compute capacity. They've done such a good job selling, now they've got to actually focus on delivery.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, now how do we turn this into the bull case? It looks like monetization is part of the deal with respect to AI.\n\nRAY WANG: You know, ChatGPT, OpenAI, all those capabilities, you know, that's where Microsoft is winning. Copilots applications, being able to do it in an office. Every person that codes is using it, especially when you're looking at GitHub, they're getting the benefits of that and that speed. And that's for-- that's the bull case.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: All right, so you're telling us here you want to buy Amazon as AI and automation not yet priced into the base case for the stock and then more free cash flows is on the horizon. And on the other side, you're saying avoid Microsoft amid steep AI competition and the run up in valuation already played out on the AI monetization front. Ray Wang, thank you.\n\nStick around, we're going to be hitting more on some of these tech themes and rivalries on the other side of the break. But that's going to do it for the latest installment of Good Buy or Goodbye. Look out for new episodes three times a week at 3:30 PM, Eastern.",

        "title": "Smart Investors Will Buy Costco Stock in Bulk This Year",
        "content": "Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is known for its discounts, but COST stock might not look cheap to some reluctant investors. Nevertheless, after viewing Costco’s recent results, even the skeptics will surely be tempted to stock up on a few shares.\n\nThere are plenty of commentators who praised Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for its robust holiday-season 2023 sales. Yet, Amazon isn’t the only business that fared well. Furthermore, Amazon doesn’t pay any dividends — but a certain retail chain does.\n\nOf course, I’m referring to Costco, which has rewarded passive-income investors for many years. So, let’s try to figure out if Costco can continue to provide outstanding value to its loyal shareholders in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts Can’t Stop Praising COST Stock\n\nAmazon might be a “Magnificent Seven” member, but Costco has the devotion of numerous Wall Street experts. It’s actually hard to keep track of all the upgrades and price-target raises. So, I’ll give you a quick synopsis of some recently published analyst firms’ ratings and price targets for Costco stock:\n\nBMO Capital: “outperform,” $700 (raised from $612) Loop Capital Markets: “buy,” $710 Bernstein: “buy,” $670 Goldman Sachs: “buy,” $665 Jefferies: “buy,” $725 (raised from $680)\n\nI could keep going ad nauseam. Other analyst firms that issued “buy” ratings on COST stock include TD Cowen and Stifel Nicolaus. But why do they like Costco’s future prospects so much?\n\nJefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe cited Costco’s “strong value offering, high renewal rates, and club expansion plans.” Meanwhile, BMO Capital analysts called Costco’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 results “solid,” and I fully concur with their positive assessment.\n\nNot only did Costco’s quarterly net sales grow 6.1% year over year to $56.72 billion, but the company’s earnings of $3.58 per share beat Wall Street’s call for $3.41 per share. In addition, Costco delighted passive-income investors with the announcement of a special dividend of $15 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco Delivers a December to Remember\n\nIn case you’re not already convinced that Costco is a terrific retailer to invest in, check this out. The company just released its sales numbers for the crucial holiday month of December 2023, and the results will surely surprise you.\n\nHere’s the rundown. During the five weeks that ended on Dec. 31, 2023, Costco generated a whopping $26.15 billion in net sales. That’s 9.9% higher than the $23.8 billion that Costco reported from the comparable year-earlier period.\n\nCostco’s results were still good if we extend the time horizon. Specifically, the company generated net sales of $82.86 billion during the 17 weeks ending on Dec. 31, 2023. That’s up 5.9% year over year – not too shabby.\n\nTo put this in context, some financial commentators wondered whether retail store chains would perform well during 2023’s holiday season despite the impact of inflation. Like Amazon, Costco showed that American consumers are resilient and still prepared to “shop ’til they drop.”\n\nCostco Stock: Expect for the Growth to Continue\n\nCostco stock performed well last year, rallying from around $520 to $650. If Costco continues to demonstrate growth and American shoppers can remain resilient, Costco shares should maintain their upward path in 2024.\n\nSo, don’t just focus on Amazon’s impressive recent performance. Take a look at Costco and conduct your due diligence on this famous discount retail chain. When all is said and done, you’ll undoubtedly want to hold at least a small position in COST stock for the remainder of this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

        "title": "Amazon’s hundreds of reported job cuts show the tech giant bit off more than it could chew with streaming and movies",
        "content": "Amazon is learning what most legacy media companies already knew: Showbiz is tough.\n\nThe e-commerce giant is cutting hundreds of employees from its streaming and movie divisious, according to an internal memo seen by Fortune. The cuts will affect Amazon MGM Studios, Prime Video, and the streaming service Twitch, an independent subsidiary that’s still unprofitable nine years on from its acquisition.\n\nThis is the second year in a row that the company is launching the new year with job cuts. Last year, Amazon had two rounds of layoffs that slashed a total of 27,000 jobs across the company, including in HR, its AWS cloud computing unit, and advertising business.\n\nThis batch of changes at Amazon come as companies across the streaming industry are reckoning with the difficulty of a business that has, so far, proven to have limited profits and high expenses. Amazon spent big money to bolster its content library, including an $8.5 billion deal to acquire the Hollywood studio MGM in 2022, and an 11-year, $11 billion broadcasting deal with the NFL that gives Amazon exclusive rights to broadcast Thursday Night Football.\n\nAcross the media landscape, companies are rethinking the strategy for their streaming services, which had previously prioritized gaining subscribers at all costs. Now, with borrowing costs high and inflation-strapped consumers being more choosy about entertainment, Amazon and its peers are looking to trim down costs and become more selective in the content they make and distribute, all while considering new sources of revenue. Some have introduced ads, emboldened by industry leader Netflix, which once swore it would never have advertising, but added it in 2022. Amazon itself will introduce ads to Prime video shows at the end of the month. Others, like Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal, have taken to licensing out content that had previously been exclusive to their own streaming services in exchange for some much-needed cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon, like many of the legacy media companies who also operate streaming services—Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Paramount—is realizing it can’t continue to spend endlessly on streaming, a business which has proved difficult to scale profitably for all except Netflix.\n\nIn announcing the layoffs, Amazon signaled it is cutting headcount to spend on content. “We’ve identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investment and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact,” senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios Mike Hopkins told employees in a message on Wednesday seen by Fortune.\n\nAmazon spent $16.6 billion on content in 2022, behind only Netflix and Disney. The costs include Amazon’s NFL contract and a very pricey Lord of the Rings show, which reportedly cost $465 million for a single season. (Full-year figures for last year’s content spend aren’t available because Amazon hasn’t reported its 2023 earnings yet.)\n\nOther media companies have opted to cut their content spending this year, with Disney slashing its content spending for fiscal 2024 by $2 billion. In recent public statements Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company made too many movies and shows for its streaming service, often at the expense of quality. “In our zeal to basically grow our content significantly to serve mostly our streaming offerings, we ended up taxing our people, in terms of their time and their focus, way beyond where they had been,” Iger told attendees at the Sun Valley Conference in November. Disney reported a $512 million loss on its streaming business in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy in the past spoke optimistically of Prime Video, telling CNBC in June he was “very bullish” about the business. Jassy said it was both a strong business on its own and had a positive halo effect on the company’s core e-commerce business.\n\nPrime Video was originally launched as a glorified marketing tool for the free shipping subscription Amazon Prime. “What we find is that customers who watch a movie that they love, they buy more Tide,” former CEO of Amazon’s worldwide consumer business Jeff Wilke told Vox in 2019. “They shop more, they’re more likely to renew their Prime subscription, they’re more likely to convert a free trial into a monthly or annual Prime subscription.”\n\nBut just a few weeks after Jassy sang Prime Video’s praises on CNBC, Bloomberg reported he was closely examining the finances of Amazon’s studio division. Despite its big budgets and buzzy programming, it can be difficult to truly gauge the success of Amazon’s entertainment business because it does not report separate financial results for the division. Secrecy aside, advertising executives are certain Amazon’s upcoming introduction of ads will be a “tornado” that upsets the streaming industry, as it is set to become the largest ad-supported streamer overnight.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the10 Best AI Stocks for 2024. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article 5 Best AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nThe latest inflation report has yet again made investors uneasy about the Fed's possible path forward. The persistent shadow of inflation is perhaps here to stay for some time and investors will adapt to this new environment. Stifel said in its 2024 outlook report themed \"Embracing Change\" that higher rates are \"here to stay\" as the firm expects muted but positive returns for stocks this year. However, Stifel said that inflation is clearly showing signs of deceleration and risks are now \"balanced.\"\n\nStifel recommended long-term investors to maintain their \"composure\" in 2024 and embrace the fact that change is the only constant in life. While sooner or later inflation will recede and rates will come down, what is here to stay and change the course of human progress is AI, which, according to Stifel, \"stands on the cusp of reshaping industries and the economy.\"\n\nThe AI revolution is that once-in-a-century kind of phenomenon that will shape and impact our society at every level. PwC said in a report said that its 2023 Emerging Technology Survey showed that just one year after the launch of ChatGPT, 54% of the surveyed companies had already implemented generative AI in some areas of their business. Companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are already launching AI products and services affecting billions of users around the globe. Best AI Stocks for 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this context, we decided to take look at some of the top AI stocks that hedge funds are piling into. For this article we first listed all popular companies that are set to gain and profit from the latest AI trends. These companies are receiving bullish comments, ratings upgrades and price target hikes from analysts because of their products and services related to AI. From this long list of stocks we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. The idea was to see which AI-related stocks are the favorites of smart money investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the most notable stocks that is gaining attention on the back of AI-related catalysts. Dan Ives of Wedbush in December listed the stock among his favorite AI and tech plays of 2024.\n\n\"While IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, we believe cloud and AI driven spending will be up 20%-25% over the next year with use cases now exploding across the enterprise and consumer landscape,” Ives said in his note.\n\nCharlotte AI is one of the generative AI products offered by Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) that have been making waves. Charlotte AI is a chatbot which can be probed by end users and security analysts regarding their system’s deficiencies and best security practices.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike gained amid resilient cybersecurity spend, continued revenue growth against well-managed expenses, and traction in endpoint adjacencies.\n\nWe have underscored that the purpose of our risk management framework is to enhance value creation and aid in the execution and implementation of our investment program. However, this stage of risk management best manifests itself in down markets as it did in 2022. This year has been quite different since equities have broadly recovered, and our risk management focus has shifted toward establishing a level of permanence. We characterize this phase of risk management as Value Capture. Essentially, we have harvested disproportionate equity outcomes (Nvidia)and other strong performers (Passport holdings such as CrowdStrike) to fund a ~700bps increase in our India weighting (Makemytrip, Apollo Healthcare), a 235bps investment in Coca Cola (in correlation terms the real thing), and even a 114bps position in Alibaba (6.6X consensus 2023 EPS at purchase). These investments are not risk free, but they are stores of value that have the potential to enhance diversification and staying power in any market reversal. Moreover, we have marginally reduced portfolio concentration over the course of the year. Essentially, 2022 was a moment of extremely low reinvestment risk that allowed us to deemphasize China and other holdings, while concentrating around a handful of financially and strategically sound investments such as Nvidia, MercadoLibre, Airbnb and CrowdStrike.With these investments having largely reflated, we have sought to redistribute some of this capital while retaining significant residual positions. It is our hope that these actions can enhance our ability to execute our investment program if, for example, market exuberance about monetary policy proves excessive.”\n\n9. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 112\n\nAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the companies best positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) has integrated AI features in its product suite that allows end users to simply give text-based commands to design graphics and edit photos. These features are expected to increase Adobe Inc's (NASDAQ:ADBE) product demand.\n\nJim Cramer said in a program a few months back that Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) made the “best use of AI.”\n\nA total of 112 hedge funds out of the 109 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) as of the end of the third quarter. The most significant stakeholder of Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) was Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $2.3 billion stake in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nIn addition to Adobe, hedge funds are also piling into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 110\n\nMany analysts are betting that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will be one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the AI boom. After all, Nvidia won’t be the only company making chips for generative AI systems. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has a history of catching up to its competition and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is already out with its new AI-focused chips.\n\nIn December, UBS called Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) one of its top semiconductor picks. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in his note that the semiconductor industry was entering a “sweet spot” and 2024 will see inventory converting to revenue.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 110 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”\n\n7. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 122\n\nEarlier this month, Bank of America added Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) in its top software stock picks for 2024.\n\n\"We expect mid-teen revenue growth, improving margins, multiple reversion and positive revisions to offset cyclical headwinds in [first-half of 2024] before driving a stronger [second half of 2024],” BofA’s Alkesh Shah said.\n\nAbout Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Shah said he sees \"enduring\" revenue growth in the mid-teens and increasing margins.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”\n\n6. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 221\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of frontrunners in the AI race since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) has the vantage point that allows it to integrate AI technologies into various services and products. Recently, BMO Capital Markets Brian Pitz said in a note that the blend of AI and content creation would help Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) along with several other tech companies.

The biggest stakeholder of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) during this period was Ken Fisher’ s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $5.7 billion stake in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included long positions in KKR, Ciena Corporation and Alphabet. Shares of media and technology company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) rose in the quarter as its advertising and cloud businesses remain robust and the company delivered results ahead of market expectations. From a sector perspective, communication services also managed a positive Q3 (2%), riding the ongoing wave of positive mega-cap stocks’ performance, like Alphabet.”\n\nLike Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet is also a hedge fund favorite when it comes to AI investing.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Hedge Funds 10 AI Stocks Billionaires Are Crazy About Jim Cramer’s 10 Best AI Stocks\n\nDisclosure.None. 10 Best AI Stocks for 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the16Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors are hopeful that small- and mid-cap stocks will experience a broader rally this year after getting hammered for most part of the previous year as all eyes remain focused on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks amid the AI boom. Noah Blackstein, senior portfolio manager at Dynamic Fund, said in a program on CNBC that market returns were “broadening out” to small- and mid-cap stocks and these stocks are expected to catch up in 2024.\n\nDespite their lackluster performance in 2023, mid-cap stocks managed to end the year at a positive note when compared to large- and small-cap stocks. The S&P MidCap 400 was up 14.5% to 2781.54 in 2023. This was just 5% below the index’s record high level. Compared to mid-cap stocks, the S&P 500 large-cap index was up 24.2% while the Russell 2000 small-cap index was up 15.1% in the period.\n\nAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, Karim Ahamed, an investment adviser for Cerity Partners in Chicago, said that mid-cap stocks provide a decent blend of growth potential (of small-cap stocks) and financial stability (of large-cap stocks).\n\nAs investors prepare to look beyond mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2024 and invest in other, relatively unknown companies with growth potential, we decided to see which mid-cap stocks with high revenue growth are popular among smart money investors. Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify mid-cap stocks with revenue growth rates of over 30% over the past five years as well as in the most recent quarters. From these stocks we chose 16 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nStory continues\n\n16. Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nBenefits management company Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY) is one of the best mid-cap growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:PGNY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We bought a new position in Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY), a company owned in our U.S. strategies for some time. They are a leading provider of fertility benefit solutions, and through their differentiated approach, their clients can pursue the most effective treatment and achieve optimal outcomes. We believe the company has only a mid-single digit share of its potential total addressable market and is the most dominant player within the fast-growing managed care category. They are already profitable, earn high returns on incremental capital, and have plenty of runway to grow top-line growth as they continue to win new clients and add new services.”\n\n15. Shoals Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:SHLS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nGoldman Sachs recently released a list of 2023 laggards it believes could gain in 2024.

(NASDAQ:SHLS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Solar energy technology companies SolarEdge and Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS), meanwhile, saw headwinds from destocking in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. demand could slow further due to new net metering rules that reduce the value to consumers from sending excess residential solar energy back to the grid. SolarEdge, which makes inverters for solar systems as well as residential and commercial battery systems, is also facing rising battery competition in the U.S. from Tesla.”\n\n14.

(NASDAQ:SWAV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also added a new position in Shockwave Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWAV), in the health care sector. The company’s innovative products help clear blockages inside arteries at a lower risk and higher efficiency than other, traditional solutions leading to more optimal outcomes for patients with coronary, vascular and heart valve diseases. We believe these innovations leave Shockwave poised for higher growth, improved margins and attractive free cash flow in a large, total addressable market.”\n\n12. Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nProject management software company Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY) shares rose in November after strong Q3 results and a bullish Q4 outlook.

(NASDAQ:ITCI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n“Slipping by -18% was Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI), which develops small molecule treatments for neurological disorders. The company reported revenues that were better than expected, though earnings were lower. There was an acceleration of sales for Caplyta, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. However, some investors appeared concerned that as Caplyta volumes increased to a higher level that the rate of growth will slow. We view the projected growth trajectory positively, as well as Caplyta’s potential for use in other indications, so we added to our position.”\n\n10.

Not only were we able to speak to customers at the event, but we got to test drive more of its software applications, including payments and invoicing. Construction is a cyclical industry. However, over time we believe the company’s profit cycle will become more stable than its end market given an ongoing digitalization trend within the construction industry, a diverse client base, large backlogs, high customer retention and the ability to cross-sell products that improve efficiency and margins. Furthermore, the company has access to a lot of data and is exploring AI as a way to help customers become more efficient, potentially enhancing its value proposition and pricing power.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Undervalued Mid Cap Stocks To Buy According to Analysts 15 Undervalued Defensive Stocks For 2024 12 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $157.17 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 2.1% since the start of the year compared to the 28.3% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 56% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 26, 2023, Amazon reported EPS of $0.85 versus consensus estimate of $0.58 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $3.61 per share on $570.95 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.66 per share on $637.24 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 34.09% and 11.61%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nAmazon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nAmazon has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 43X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 19.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 32.3X versus its peer group's average of 15.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.51. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Amazon shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nHow Does AMZN Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of AMZN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE). EXPE has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of D, and a Momentum Score of A.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter.

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Amazon a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Amazon (AMZN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AMZN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nAmazon's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Amazon's main business drivers.\n\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\r\n\r\nIts online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish footprint in physical grocery supermarket space.\n\nAmazon also enjoys dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin generating businesses.\n\nAmazon has also become a household name with its Alexa powered Echo devices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa is helping the company sell products and services.\n\nRevenues were $513.98 billion in 2022. The company reports revenue under three broad heads—North America, International and AWS, which generated 61.5%, 23% and 15.6% of total revenues, respectively.\n\nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, Amazon targets three categories of customers—consumers, sellers and website developers. Consumers are offered variety, convenience and free delivery of goods displayed on the company’s websites.\r\n\r\nThe agreements with sellers are varied, enabling them to use the company’s websites to either sell their merchandise directly, or redirect customers to the sellers’ own branded websites. In case of the latter arrangement, Amazon earns a fee for the sales thus generated.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition comes in the form of traditional retailers, other online retailers, media companies, web portals, search engines, e-commerce companies and cloud computing service providers.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Amazon ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2014 would be worth $7,804.66, or a 680.47% gain, as of January 12, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 159.46% and the price of gold increased 58.59% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for AMZN.\n\nAmazon’s shares have outperformed the industry in the year-to-date period. The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, we expect 2023 revenue to be up 10.8% from 2022. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.\n\nShares have gained 5.26% over the past four weeks and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Amazon-owned online audiobook and podcast service Audible is laying off about 5% of its workforce, marking the third round of job cuts at the e-commerce giant's businesses this week as the technology industry continues to shed roles in the new year.\n\nIn a memo sent to employees Thursday, Audible CEO Bob Carrigan said the company is in good shape, but faces an \"increasingly challenging landscape.”\n\n“We did not take this route without considerable thought,” Carrigan said. “But getting leaner and more efficient is the way we will need to operate now — and in the foreseeable future — in order to continue delivering best-in-class audio storytelling to our customers around the world.”\n\nA spokesperson for Audible declined to provide the number of employees who will be affected by the cuts.\n\nThe layoffs at Audible follow others announced this week in Amazon’s Prime Video and MGM Studios unit, which is trimming hundreds of employees from its payroll as it cuts back in areas that are not delivering. Earlier this week, Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch also said it was cutting more than 500 jobs in a bid to save on costs and become more profitable.\n\nAudible was purchased by Seattle-based Amazon in 2008 for roughly $300 million and is both a top distributor and producer of audio books, meditation programs and podcasts. The service is dominant in the audiobook market and has sought to pull in more customers through exclusive content and high-profile deals, including a multiyear agreement it inked with Higher Ground Productions, a production company founded by former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle.\n\nTech companies like Amazon ramped up hiring during the pandemic, but they began cutting costs as inflation and interest rates spiked and their focus turned to profitability.\n\nThe recent job cuts follows mass layoffs that began at Amazon in late 2022 and have impacted more than 27,000 employees.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a spokesperson for Discord confirmed that the social media company is laying off 17% of its staff – or 170 employees – in what it characterized as a move to bring more agility to its workforce after a pandemic-induced surge in hiring.\n\nOther tech companies — including Google, IT company Xerox and video game software provider Unity Software — have also announced layoffs in recent days, signaling the industry’s job shedding is far from over.",

Individual users and institutional users alike utilize the cloud. Those services and infrastructure continue to grow at a rapid pace making cloud stocks an important subsector.\n\nInvestors will continue to put their capital behind cloud companies because the overall growth rate projections are strong. It is expected that compound annual growth will average above 16% in the years between 2023 and 2028. Further, AI is a strong component of the cloud sector that promises to potentially increase growth even further. The cloud stocks below will continue to have a high likelihood of providing healthy returns for investors.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

Recent data suggest that the company controls roughly 30% of cloud market share. Its primary competitors are the two companies listed directly below who respectively account for 20% and 10% of cloud market share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon is exciting for a lot of reasons. As a massive tech company, it has a lot of ways to win and many business segments that produce large sums of money and sales. but just how much of the company’s current business is attributable to its cloud business?\n\nThe answer to that question can be found in the company’s most recent earnings report. of the $143.1 billion in sales at Amazon in the third quarter, $23.1 billion were attributable to AWS. The rate of overall growth was very similar to the rate of growth of AWS. That’s not particularly important but I thought that it might give readers some context.\n\nAmazon is currently making a big push through AWS to upskill the labor force with marketable AI training. The recent emergence of AI and its application to the cloud and data centers gives Amazon yet another catalyst that promises to spark further growth in the already massive firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as mentioned, is the second largest cloud provider commanding 20% of market share.  Like Amazon and its stock, Microsoft has many avenues that lead to continued future growth.\n\nOne main differentiator between Microsoft and Amazon in terms of cloud is that cloud is much more relevant to the former than the latter. Microsoft’s cloud, called Azure, is both growing faster and is a larger contributor to the company overall than is the cloud for Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft reported $56.5 billion in revenues during the most recent quarter. Of that, $31.8 billion were attributable to the company’s cloud business. That’s roughly 60% of revenue whereas Amazon’s AWS Cloud accounts for roughly 15% of its business.\n\nThus, there’s an argument to be made that investors who are seeking pure cloud revenues should preference Microsoft over Amazon. One caveat here: despite the fact that Azure accounts for more revenues than does AWS, AWS has much greater server capacity.\n\nFurther confounding the argument is the fact that Azure’s market share has doubled in the last 5 years. Choosing one over the other isn’t straightforward so it’s perfectly logical for investors to choose both.\n\nGoogle (GOOG,GOOGL) The Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL) logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nI characterized Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL)  as the laggard of the three leading cloud computing stocks. While it is true that Google’s cloud is the smallest in terms of revenues, it’s also true that its growth is the fastest of the three.\n\nGoogle’s Cloud grew by 22% during the third quarter, reaching total sales of $8.4 billion. It was the fastest growing of the three cloud giants. Again, it’s easy to make an argument that favors any of the three as a preferred cloud stock investment.\n\nSo, what will Google Cloud look like in 2024 and where will the company focus? The answer to that question can be found in this article. Google will continue to focus its cloud business in a manner that optimizes the generative AI opportunity. In other words, the company will continue in 2024 to do what it did in 2023. It’s clear that the company has identified a strategic focus on the provision of enterprise life cycle Cloud AI services. That was a mouthful but the company is basically helping to leverage its cloud and AI through long-term, high-value contracts.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) is a data analytics software firm that operates on cloud computing platforms. Its software leverages the cloud platforms of the firms mentioned above in many cases. And like those firms, Snowflake sees a massive opportunity and 2024 in generative AI.\n\nThere are many reasons to believe that Snowflake is in prime position to grow rapidly in 2024. In order to understand that opportunity, let’s look back to 2022. It was during that time that many companies decided to optimize — aka cut spending — in cloud investment and everywhere else.\n\nCloud spending declined and since then has continued to slowly rebound. The point I want to make here is that Snowflake is rebounding and growing much faster than those larger companies mentioned above. During the most recent quarter, Snowflake’s revenues grew by 34%.\n\nThis leads me to my next point: growth is rapidly coming back into fashion. The worst of macroeconomic cyclicality is past us and rate cuts are on the horizon. Snowflake is primed to garner a lot of investment for that reason. SNOW shares have much greater potential  to provide rapid returns than those firms do.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) continues to be one of the best and most stable value stocks in the cloud and AI space. I continue to recommend it for many reasons which relates to that stability.\n\nFor example, Cisco Systems pays a dividend yielding more than 3% with a 0.47 payout ratio which hasn’t been reduced since 2011. Further, CSCO shares provide good value based on their P/E ratio of just above 15, which is slightly below where it has been over the past decade.\n\nIt’s a more conservative oriented Investments which is perfectly logical as value stocks are generally great investments.\n\nAnyway, there is news about Cisco Systems as it relates to the cloud. The company is buying private firm Isovalent which focuses on cloud native security. It’s a strong sign that Cisco Systems will continue to focus on strengthening its security business overall. Security continues to be a major concern for enterprises of all sizes especially as artificial intelligence develops. The recent acquisition gives investors yet another reason to consider CSCO shares.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a stock to consider for investors who like Cisco Systems but perhaps want a bit more growth. Both firms provide security delivered through the cloud with Palo Alto Networks being the younger, less established, more growth oriented of the two.\n\nThat truth is reflected in the company’s earnings report which shows that revenues grew by 20% during the most recent quarter. However, Palo Alto Networks does not pay a dividend, as you might expect given its rapid growth rate.\n\nGiven how important cloud security has become and will continue to be, Palo Alto Networks is a reasonable investment. That’s especially true given the fact that the company’s Non-GAAP operating margin and net income both exceeded guidance during the quarter. That gave the company the confidence to increase guidance for both of those metrics in the coming quarter.\n\nIn short, if you’re forced to make a choice between cloud security firms mentioned here, it may just come down to a growth versus value argument. Palo Alto Networks is a strong choice for those who prefer growth.\n\nVeeva Systems (VEEV) veev stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nVeeva Systems (NASDAQ:VEEV) will continue to attract investors who are interested in the life sciences industry. The company provides cloud-based services for firms in that particular sector with a focus on customer relationship management (CRM). Its stock carries an ‘overweight’ rating and offers upside to investors at the moment.\n\nWhile I characterized Viva systems as working in the life sciences industry it really works in the pharma industry. The company provides services that help pharma firms throughout the drug development life cycle from discovery through commercialization.\n\nThe reason that I think Veeva Systems is a strong choice among cloud stocks is that the company is rapidly maturing. Its growth isn’t spectacular, although revenues did increase by 12% to $616.5 million in Q3.\n\nInstead, what I like is the fact that it produces strong net income with $135.2 million in the most recent quarter. The point here is that Viva systems net income increased by 25% which is essentially double the growth rate of its top line.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Despite how strong the stock market grew in 2023, there were more than a few pockets of despair in the market. We know the S&P 500 was driven higher almost wholly on the strength of the Magnificent 7 stocks, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 also experienced superb gains.\n\nOf course, the seven high-growth tech stocks also influenced some of those indices’ gains. Where the S&P and Nasdaq are market cap-weighted, the Dow is price-weighted. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $185 a share, weighs in at over 3% of the Dow but has a 9% weighting in the Nasdaq. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), on the other hand, accounts for 4% of the Nasdaq but, by tripling in value last year, lifted the index to new heights.\n\nWhile I had some surprises with my portfolio’s winners last year as a result, some of my biggest losers raised eyebrows too. Let’s see if any of these down-and-out companies from last year can turn into rebounding stocks this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) 5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAuto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) was the stock that caught me off guard the most. Shares declined 18% last year, making it the third worst-performing stock in my portfolio.\n\nThe distributor of automotive and industrial replacement parts through its chain of NAPA Auto Parts stores has long been one of my best holdings. The stock’s biggest drop, however, followed third-quarter earnings. Despite missing Wall Street’s expectations, sales and profits both rose, margins widened and it produced $733 million in free cash flow (FCF) during the first nine months of 2023.\n\nIt’s likely inflation and rising interest rates finally took a toll because the market remains favorable for GPC stock. The cost of both new and used cars remains elevated even if they hit below the highs. That means current owners are incentivized to keep their existing cars running for as long as possible.\n\nI consider Genuine Parts the leading candidate to rebound this year. It’s also a solid dividend stock with a 68-year history of increasing its payout. With sufficient FCF to support the dividend, it’s in no danger of following the route of my next worst-performing stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the largest pharmacy chains, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has been a disappointing holding for years. Although healthcare is a necessity regardless of market conditions, Walgreens has struggled in recent years. Competition from CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was fierce. Foot traffic lagged, it settled for $5.7 billion in its role in the opioid crisis and its medical clinics underperformed.\n\nThat all weighed on Walgreens’ finances too leading to its bombshell announcement it was slashing its dividend nearly in half. The stock is now down 7% in 2024.\n\nBut don’t count the pharmacy chain out just yet. As painful as the dividend cut is, it was necessary to conserve cash. The stock just might be in a better position to grow throughout the rest of the year. I’m not expecting it to top the charts, but if it finally spins off its U.K.-based Boots pharmacy as planned, sheds the Beauty No7 brand and continues its cost-cutting plans, Walgreens could see shares grow again this year.\n\nOrion Office REIT (ONL) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nThe biggest loser in my portfolio was Orion Office REIT (NYSE:ONL), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates U.S. office properties. It’s also the only one of the three losing stocks I didn’t buy. I got shares when another holding, Realty Income (NYSE:O), spun off its office property operations in 2021.\n\nYet it’s not surprising why it’s done so poorly. As a REIT specializing in acquiring single-tenant net lease office properties, it relies heavily on debt to finance operations. That exposes the REIT to higher interest costs and credit risks, especially in a rising interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve ratcheted rates higher last year in an unprecedented series of spikes, impacting Orion’s finances.\n\nAlthough the Fed hinted at possible rate cuts this year, there’s too much uncertainty now. Even so, rates won’t go appreciably lower to improve the REIT’s position. It does have a strong portfolio of properties in attractive markets, high occupancy rates and stable cash flows. The macroeconomic situation, however, may be too tough to fight. I expect Orion Office REIT to be a laggard once again this year. I remain hopeful for the long run, however.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a long position in GPC, WBA, ONL and O stock.

        "title": "Salesforce (NYSE:CRM): Analysts Can’t Agree on This Pricey Software Stock",
        "content": "For the most part, analysts are optimistic about Salesforce’s (NYSE:CRM) growth prospects in 2024. However, analysts don’t all agree, and some of them are actually bearish on Salesforce. I am neutral on CRM stock because, when all is said and done, I like the company but am concerned about the elevated share price.\n\nSalesforce specializes in customer relations management (CRM) software for businesses. The company, like practically every other large-cap software company in America, is now emphasizing its use of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nConsequently, while CRM stock isn’t a “Magnificent Seven” stock, it still rallied sharply last year. It’s always possible for the momentum to continue, but prospective investors should take note of both the bullish and the bearish arguments. Then, they need to think about Salesforce’s valuation, as it could be a major issue this year.\n\nThe Bullish Argument for Salesforce Stock\n\nIt’s not difficult to see why some folks are enthused about Salesforce right now. For instance, momentum-focused traders will undoubtedly like Salesforce stock’s performance in 2023. Amazingly, the stock zoomed from $140 to $250 in just 12 months.\n\nWhen a stock rallies sharply like this, analysts typically raise their price targets because they practically have no choice. In the case of CRM stock, maintaining a $140 or $150 price target wouldn’t make sense anymore.\n\nSo, it makes sense that Baird analyst Robert Oliver would hike his Salesforce stock price target from $240 to $300. The Baird analyst also upgraded Salesforce from a Neutral rating to an Outperform rating, citing Salesforce’s price increases and the company’s push to deliver on margins.\n\n$300 isn’t an extremely high price target for Salesforce stock, so I won’t disagree with it. In contrast, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Keith Weiss upgraded Salesforce shares from Equal Weight (Hold-rating equivalent) to Overweight (Buy-rating equivalent) and raised his price target on the stock from $290 to a highly ambitious $350.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike the Baird analysts, Weiss cited product price hikes. Specifically, Weiss stated, “Low investor expectations vs potential top-line upside drivers in price increases, product bundling and Data Cloud adoption frame an attractive risk/reward for CRM.”\n\nWhether the risk/reward is “attractive” for Salesforce stock is debatable, but I’ll get to that in a moment. Before I veer away from the bull case, I should also mention that Salesforce has an arrangement with the almighty Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), known as the Buy with Prime for Salesforce Commerce Cloud integration.\n\nAs TheFly summed up, this collaboration enables Salesforce’s merchants to integrate Amazon’s “Buy with Prime into their existing shopping experience.” It’s certainly worth considering as part of the bullish argument for CRM stock.\n\nSalesforce’s Valuation Problem\n\nIn opposition to momentum-focused traders, value investors might take issue with last year’s supersized rally in Salesforce stock. After all, a company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio can become alarmingly high when a stock goes from $140 to $250.\n\nWhen it comes to Salesforce, the Baird analyst referred to the company’s margins, but Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) analyst Michael Turrin feels that Salesforce has already “captured much of the value from its margin expansion story.” Hence, Turrin lowered his rating on CRM stock from Overweight to Equal Weight and chose not to raise his $280 price target on the shares.\n\nIn addition, I should mention that investment research firm Bernstein raised its price target on Salesforce stock from $159 to $212, which is still quite bearish, and reiterated its Underperform rating on Salesforce shares. Bernstein, according to TheFly, sees “only modest acceleration in IT spend growth and possibly softer growth in software segment growth” for Salesforce.\n\nFinally, I must address the elephant in the room — Salesforce’s valuation, as measured by the company’s GAAP-measured trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 100.5x. For comparison, the sector median P/E ratio is 27.5x.\n\nIs Salesforce Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CRM comes in as a Moderate Buy based on 26 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Salesforce stock price target is $281.57, implying 4.8% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CRM stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Keith Bachman of BMO Capital, with an average return of 22.56% per rating and an 85% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider Salesforce Stock?\n\nSalesforce’s margin expansion is worth monitoring, but it’s definitely possible that the market already priced in Salesforce’s margin growth for 2023 and even for 2024. Also, while Weiss might see “low investor expectations” for Salesforce, I’m seeing overstated investor expectations as expressed in the company’s P/E ratio.\n\nDon’t get the wrong idea. Salesforce is a good company with an AI connection, and there’s no denying that Salesforce has had a great earnings track record. All in all, I just want to see CRM stock pull back 10% or even 20% before I can feel comfortable with Salesforce’s valuation, so I am not considering the stock at its current price.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Amazon layoffs show Big Tech is still coming down from pandemic highs",
        "content": "The COVID-era spending spree is over. And the tech layoffs keep coming.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is eliminating several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios, according to a memo sent to staff on Wednesday. And the company's video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, announced it is laying off more than 500 people.\n\nThat Amazon is ringing in the new year with another round of cuts highlights the tech sector's climb down from COVID-era expansion. Even as confidence grows on Wall Street that the economy will finally break free from fears of a recession, tech companies are still reeling from heady staffing days and ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nDuring the acute phase of the public health crisis, company ranks swelled alongside aspirations of rapid growth and a tech-centric transformation. Many executives and market observers believed new consumer habits would redefine the trends to come and accelerate changes already on the way. Screen time exploded as social lives shrunk and adapted. But the spike in demand for e-commerce and digital services eventually leveled off, leaving executives with what they claimed were bloated teams and inefficiency. A brutal wave of job cuts was their answer.\n\n\"A lot of companies in various sectors of the economy had rapid expansion during the 'stay at home economy,'\" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \"Amazon is taking steps to narrow the gap between employee headcount and the growth of its business.\"\n\nAmazon was arguably the darling of the pandemic era as it benefited from consumers’ sudden shift to online shopping and businesses’ broad move to the cloud, said Nicole Tanenbaum, partner and chief investment strategist at Chequers Financial Management. During this period, Amazon’s profitability soared while the company boosted staffing and leaned into expanded offerings and markets. Amazon’s headcount grew by 310,000 from 2020 to 2021, an increase of almost 25%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as the disruptions of the pandemic eased into a recovering economy,the company’s prior investment decisions collided with slowing revenue growth, a reset in consumer spending patterns, and increasing cost pressures triggered by historic inflation.\n\nAmazon also faced a major leadership transition. Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, whose identity is intimately tied to the company, stepped aside as CEO in 2021. Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon’s lucrative and industry-leading cloud service, AWS, then took the reins.\n\n“Not only does Jassy take a much more direct approach with regards to regulatory and political issues, he has not been afraid to admit that the company overbuilt and needed to reset its approach, lasering in on efforts to control margins and operations in the face of significant inflationary pressures,” Tanenbaum said. Amazon is cutting several hundred positions across its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFor Jassy and Amazon, rightsizing the business arrived in the form of substantial cost-cutting initiatives. The company enacted stark headcount reductions along with a hiring freeze to further control costs.\n\nAmazon's layoffs over the last several years amount to more than 27,000 cuts. The latest round underscores the financial pullback, especially in contrast to massive spending during peak COVID. For instance,Amazon spent $8.5 billion to acquire MGM, the home of James Bond, in 2022. And the company is estimated to have doled out more than $1 billion to produce multiple seasons of The Rings of Power, its Lord of the Rings prequel series, and likely the most expensive show ever.\n\nWhile Amazon is among the largest private employers in the US, and the biggest within the tech world, several of its industry peers have turned to drastic layoffs. Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, dubbed 2023 the \"year of efficiency.\" The social media company cut more than 20,000 jobs since late 2022 to cope with declining ad revenue and to improve the business and its cost structure.\n\nAnd Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which has cut more than 10,000 jobs in that period, said on Thursday it is laying off hundreds of workers on its digital assistant, hardware, and engineering teams, as the search giant aims to trim costs and focus on its biggest priorities.\n\nThere is a chance Big Tech will bolster its ranks if the Fed starts to cut rates later this year, relaxing the more reserved posture the industry has adopted. But what’s happening now to staff levels suggests otherwise, said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. After peaking in the spring of 2022, tech industry headcounts suffered a significant decline through the summer of last year. Those losses eventually flattened out and leveled off, a trend that’s likely to continue, as exuberance gives way to caution.\n\nThe digital lives of consumers changed during the pandemic — that's undeniable. But they continue to change, along with the next chapter of the US economy.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "MUMBAI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Netflix has removed an Indian language film from its platform after the movie faced a backlash on social media for depicting the daughter of a Hindu priest eating meat.\n\nHindus are India's largest religious grouping and Hindu priests, as well as their families, are typically vegetarian.\n\n\"Annapoorani - The Goddess of Food\", a Tamil-language film that was released in theatres in December and aired on Netflix later the same month, was no longer available on the international streaming platform as of Thursday.\n\nNetflix representatives in India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Wednesday, protesters from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a hardline Hindu organisation with ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, shouted slogans against Netflix and the movie at the company's Mumbai office, according to a post on X by VHP spokesperson Shriraj Nair.\n\nThe film depicts the daughter of a Hindu temple priest in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu eating meat and later entering a high-stakes cooking contest, where she cooks meat.\n\n\"This film ... is intentionally released to hurt Hindu sentiments,\" Ramesh Solanki, who described himself as the head of an organisation called \"Hindu IT Cell,\" said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nSolanki said he had filed a complaint to Mumbai's police about the film, listing several scenes which he said were offensive to Hindus.\n\nNetflix and rivals like Amazon and Disney have often been at the receiving end of criticism from hardline religious groups in India, one of the world's biggest streaming markets.\n\nIn 2021, Amazon offered a rare apology for some scenes in its series \"Tandav\", which faced court cases and complaints that it offended Hindus.\n\nNetflix and Amazon have become hugely popular in India, which is set to grow into a $7 billion market for the sector by 2027, according to Media Partners Asia.

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google Cloud said on Thursday its customers who want to migrate their data to another cloud provider will not have to pay any network fees to make the transfer.\n\nMany cloud providers, including Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS), charge customers based on the amount of data transferred when they switch vendors.\n\nBritain's media regulator Ofcom in October raised concerns about the fees, saying it can discourage customers from switching to an alternative provider. Ofcom had earlier asked the country's antitrust authority to investigate tech giants' dominance of the UK cloud market.\n\nAlthough eliminating data transfer fees will make it easier for customers to change their cloud provider, restrictive and unfair licensing practices are why many customers do not switch, Amit Zavery, head of platform at Google Cloud wrote in a blog post.\n\n\"Making it easier for customers to move from one provider to another does little to improve choice if customers remain locked in with restrictive licences,\" he said.\n\nAWS leads the cloud computing market, followed by Azure, and Google is a distant third. Both Google and Amazon had earlier said that Microsoft's terms of services had made it difficult for customers to switch.\n\nRemoval of data transfer fees applies to all customers globally from Thursday.

        "content": "Microsoft MSFT and OpenAI, the creator of the popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT, are continuously making significant strides that will further solidify their presence in the global chatbot market. The global chatbot market size is expected to hit $7.01 billion in 2024 and reach $20.8 billion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 24.3% between 2024 and 2029.\r\n\r\nOpenAI has launched the GPT Store to create a marketplace for specialized chatbot agents based on their language models, particularly ChatGPT. This move allows users to buy and sell customized bots beyond what is offered through ChatGPT Plus. Users can develop chatbot agents with unique personalities or themes for various purposes, such as salary negotiation, creating lesson plans and developing recipes.\r\n\r\nThe store was initially scheduled to open in November but faced delays due to internal upheaval at OpenAI, including the firing and subsequent reappointment of CEO Sam Altman. The company plans to launch a revenue-sharing program in the first quarter, where builders will be compensated based on user engagement with their GPTs, although specific details have not been shared yet.\r\n\r\nTo feature in the GPT Store, developers have to verify their user profiles and submit their GPTs to OpenAI’s new review system. This involves a mix of human and automated review to ensure the GPTs comply with the company’s terms of use.\r\n\r\nOpenAI has emphasized the need for users to ensure that their chatbots adhere to usage policies and brand guidelines. The store is accessible to subscribers of premium services, such as ChatGPT Plus, Enterprise and the new subscription tier called Team, which costs $25 per month for each user. Team subscribers can create custom GPTs for their team’s specific needs.\r\n\r\nDuring a demo day for developers, the company has offered to cover legal costs for developers facing potential copyright law issues related to products based on ChatGPT and OpenAI's technology. OpenAI has been sued multiple times for alleged copyright infringement related to the use of copyrighted text in training its language models.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nMSFT Leads the Race for AI Revenues Through OpenAI\n\nMicrosoft, which has gained 15.3% in the past three months, is being propelled by the success of ChatGPT. The launch of enterprise capabilities of Azure OpenAI and Copilots across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is expected to be a game changer for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $242.41 billion, indicating 14.3% growth from fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings is pinned at $11.14 per share, up 13.5% from the year-ago actual figure.\r\n\r\nThe launch of the GPT store underlines Microsoft and OpenAI’s efforts to rapidly evolve their offerings in an attempt to stay ahead of rivals, such as Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google and Adobe ADBE in the AI arms race. ChatGPT had about 100 million weekly active users as of November, according to OpenAI, and more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies use the platform.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is launching a range of features for Google Bard starting in 2024. The upcoming updates include custom bots, tasks, shared queries, \"Power Ups,\" and a paid \"Advanced\" tier. Further, Google will introduce new sections in Bard, namely Gallery and Tasks, to showcase its capabilities, including image generation and prompt improvement through the \"Power Up\" button.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services, introduced Amazon Q, an AI-powered chatbot that assists in content creation and action-taking based on customer information repositories, code and enterprise systems. Further, Amazon Q streamlines tasks, accelerates decision-making and fosters creativity by providing personalized information and advice tailored to individual user identities, roles and permissions.\r\n\r\nAdobe has announced the commercial release of its family of creative generative AI models, Firefly. Adobe Firefly supports text prompts in more than 100 languages, helps creators make several changes to their content, creates endless variations seamlessly and bolsters image generation capabilities. The company is gaining strong momentum among content creators with Firefly.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Top Stock-Split Stocks to Buy for 2024",
        "content": "Stock splits don't automatically boost a stock -- but they still could help you pick out a top player to buy by pointing you toward companies with track records of success. Companies generally launch a split after performing well, with the idea that more growth lies ahead.\n\nBy offering current stockholders more shares, the company lowers the price of each individual share without touching overall market value. This makes the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n\nHistory shows us that investors haven't necessarily piled into stock-split players right away, so a split itself won't trigger gains. But over time, the companies that have been successful often continue to deliver when it comes to growth, and that makes them winners over and over again.\n\nWant in on that action in 2024 and beyond? Then consider these two stock-split players to buy right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) shares soared past $3,500 back in 2021, and the company split its stock a year later. Some near-term challenges -- including the pressure of higher costs due to interest-rate hikes -- got in the way of its post-split performance. But the company set to work on its cost structure and reignited earnings growth, and its shares climbed in the double digits last year.\n\nDespite the gain, the stock still trades at about half of what it traded for a couple of years ago in relation to forward earnings estimates. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nConsidering Amazon's long-term prospects, this looks like a deal to me. Why am I so optimistic about the stock? For a few reasons. First, Amazon is a leader in two markets growing in the double digits -- e-commerce and cloud computing -- so it's well positioned to benefit from this growth over time.\n\nSecond, the company is ensuring this dominance, thanks to its work on serving customers well in both businesses. For example, in e-commerce, Amazon has put into place infrastructure to gain in delivery speed, which should keep customers coming back. And in cloud computing, Amazon Web Services has built up its artificial intelligence (AI) services, offering clients easy ways to apply this hot technology to their businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Amazon's cost-structure improvements should serve it well over time -- whether the economy is weak or strong. The company has already shifted from losses and cash outflows during a difficult 2022 to profit and billion-dollar inflows of cash a year later. All of this means now and into the future, Amazon could deliver a lot more gains in earnings and share price.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) also split its stock in recent times after many years of earnings growth and top share performance. GOOG Chart\n\nToday, we don't have any reason to believe the company's dominance in its market, earnings growth, and stock market gains will stop. By maintaining decent growth through difficult economic times, Alphabet showed its strength -- and its shares may even be ready to extend last year's gains.\n\nOne big reason to like this company has to do with its leadership in the internet search market. Most of us are used to \"Googling it\" when we don't know the answer to a question. It's become part of our routine, and that has led Alphabet's Google to a 91% share of the search market.\n\nWhat's key here is this brand strength has become Alphabet's moat, or competitive advantage. It will be very difficult for a competitor to grab a significant share and unseat this top player.\n\nImportantly, this market share doesn't just give Alphabet bragging rights but is key to the company bringing in revenue. Thanks to the company's search position, advertisers flock to Alphabet to advertise -- so when you search on Google, you'll see an ad that may be linked to something you would like to buy. Alphabet's investment in AI today to make search better and better should serve as the element that seals the deal with advertisers for the long term -- and that's more good news for the company and investors.\n\nFinally, Alphabet's cloud computing business may not be as big as Amazon's, but it's high growth -- with revenue climbing in the double digits in the most recent quarter.\n\nToday, you can pick up shares of this technology powerhouse for only 21 times forward earnings estimates. And that looks dirt cheap considering Alphabet's earnings and market-share track record -- and the likelihood of all of that growth continuing over the long term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "U.S. CPI ahead, SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Traders are awaiting key U.S. inflation numbers for December, which could play into how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate reductions this year. Elsewhere, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves several applications to create spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, in a landmark decision for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n1. Crucial inflation data ahead\n\nHeadline U.S. inflation is expected to have sped up marginally in December, while the annual underlying reading is seen slowing, as Federal Reserve officials search for signs of easing price gains before rolling out possible interest rate cuts this year.\n\nEconomists estimate that the year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) from the world's largest economy accelerated to 3.2% last month, up from 3.1% in November. Month-on-month, the pace is projected to increase to 0.2%.\n\nBut the rate of the so-called \"core\" measure, which strips out volatile items like food and energy, is tipped to drop to 3.8%, down from 4.0% in the prior month. On a monthly basis, core CPI is anticipated to match November's figure of 0.3%.\n\nFed policymakers will likely be closely watching the data, which could factor into how they approach rate reductions later in 2024. In a speech on Wednesday, New York Fed President John Williams argued it is still too soon to call for cuts because inflation is well above the bank's stated 2% target.\n\nWilliams' comments echoed sentiments from other rate-setters, who have recently moved to temper soaring market enthusiasm for potential reductions early this year. This optimism, fueled in part by a dovish Fed outlook last month, drove a rally in stocks in the final weeks of 2023 that has since lost some steam.\n\n2. Futures edge higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Thursday, with traders gearing up for the publication of the inflation data at 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT).\n\nBy 05:04 ET (10:04 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 40 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had increased by 8 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 59 points or 0.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main indices on Wall Street closed in the green on Wednesday. The benchmark S&P 500 rose by 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed by 0.8%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 0.5%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) touched a fresh record high after peer TSMC posted fourth-quarter revenue that beat expectations, while Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit its highest intraday level since 2021 following a price target upgrade from anaysts at Mizuho.\n\nAlong with inflation, investors are awaiting a raft of financial results from major U.S. banks later in the week.\n\n3. SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin was trading higher on Thursday after the top U.S. securities regulator approved the first exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, Bitcoin had risen 1.4% to $46,283.4.\n\nIn a decision that is anticipated to have sweeping implications for the wider crypto industry, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light on Wednesday to 11 applications from a range of issuers, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity as well as digital currency asset manager Grayscale.\n\nSome proponents of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, have claimed that the SEC's approval would spark a rush of demand into the token. Through a spot Bitcoin ETF, investors will have the chance to gain exposure to the digital asset without directly owning it. Detractors have, however, flagged that ETFs could persuade retail traders to pour money into a sector that has been beset with a spate of fraud-related scandals and huge volatility.\n\nThe decision, which was backed by SEC Chair and known crypto-skeptic Gary Gensler, marked a U-turn for a commission that has largely been reticent to sign off on a spot Bitcoin ETF for much of the past decade. It also comes after hackers temporarily took control of the SEC's account on social media platform X on Wednesday and falsely claimed that the regulator had already approved the applications, sparking wild fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin.\n\n4. Google announces lay-offs across multiple teams - reports\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is dismissing hundreds of its employees across several divisions to decrease costs and support an ongoing push into artificial intelligence, according to media reports.\n\nCiting a Google spokesperson, the reports said the lay-offs will impact workers at the search giant's core engineering division. Hundreds of roles at its Voice Assistant division, as well as the hardware team behind its Pixel phone, Nest smart home devices, and Fitbit watches, will be eliminated.\n\nThe exact number of employees losing their jobs was not immediately specified by Google, the reports said.\n\nGoogle's cuts extend a continuing trend of job reductions in the tech industry. On Wednesday, e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reportedly laid off several hundred employees at its live-streaming unit Twitch, Prime Video service and MGM studios.\n\n5. Oil rebounds following U.S. inventories build\n\nOil prices rose Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s weakness as attacks on shipping through the Red Sea persisted.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% higher at $72.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 1.8% to $78.18 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks settled lower on Wednesday after official data showed an unexpected weekly build of 1.3 million barrels in U.S. inventories, contrasting with earlier industry data that signaled a weekly draw.\n\nWhile the build was minimal, the data also showed a second straight week of large product inventory builds, pointing to softness in U.S. fuel demand. This notion was exacerbated by a severe winter storm on the east coast of the country, which further disrupted road travel in the world’s largest fuel consumer.\n\nHowever, the market remained supported by ongoing concerns about disruptions to Middle East supplies after Yemen-based Houthis mounted their largest attack yet on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. CPI ahead, SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ considers lowering FY2024 inflation outlook to mid-2% range - Jiji\n\nTrump's civil fraud trial: four key moments",

        "content": "Prime Video and Amazon Studios SVP Mike Hopkins attends the Los Angeles Premiere of Amazon Studios’ “Cinderella” at The Greek Theatre on August 30, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nAmazon (AMZN)’s streaming and studio units are kicking off 2024 with a leaner team than last year, continuing a cost reduction theme championed by the tech giant’s CEO Andy Jassy since late 2022. In an internal email today (Jan. 10), Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, announced the two units are cutting “several hundred” jobs as part of an effort to produce more film, TV and live sports programs in the long run.\n\n“Our industry continues to evolve quickly and it’s important that we prioritize our investments for the long-term success of our business,” Hopkins said in today’s. “We’ve identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investment and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact.”\n\nThe layoffs represent a small percentage of the Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios staff. When Observer reached out to Amazon about which positions are being eliminated and which ones are being prioritized, the company didn’t comment beyond Hopkins’s statement. Amazon also didn’t respond to a question about the content and product initiatives Hopkins touted in his email. IndieWire reported the layoffs were partially informed by carryover issues created by Amazon’s acquisition of MGM in 2022.\n\nAmazon closed its $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM Studios in March 2022. Through MGM, Amazon recently made a deal with board game company Games Workshop to work on film and TV projects related to its popular miniature wargame, Warnhammer 40,000.\n\nPrime Video is expected to launch an ad-supported default subscription plan at the end of this month (Jan. 29), marking the first time Amazon Prime members will have to pay extra for an ad-free experience—an increasingly standard offering in the streaming industry. Subscribers will have to pay an extra $3 a month on top of the $14.99 baseline plan to go ad-free. Amazon announced the change in September 2023. At the time, CEO Jassy promised that, even with ads, Prime Video will have “meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV or other streaming TV providers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral streaming services, including Netflix, are raising prices for their ad-free plans in hopes to draw more new subscribers to their more affordable ad-supported plans and potentially increase revenue.\n\nAmazon is expected to report financial results of the December quarter and full 2023 early next month. Investors will hear how Jassy’s aggressive cost-cutting measures have worked out for the company so far.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nEmma Watson's Best Style Moments The Best Red Carpet Fashion at the 2024 Golden Globes These Are the Winners of the 81st Golden Globe Awards A New Star Shines in Yet Another Uninspired 'Carmen' 'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning\n\nRead the original story Amazon's Prime Video and Studio Chief Cuts Staff as MGM Merger Issues Linger and others by Nhari Djan at Observer.",

        "content": "Shares of iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT) fell 19.8% late Wednesday after Politico reported Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) will not offer concessions to European Union (E.U.) antitrust regulators as it works to clear its impending acquisition of the home robotics specialist.\n\nAmazon isn't backing down from antitrust regulators\n\nCiting two people familiar with the situation late this afternoon, Politico says Amazon and iRobot have until the end of the day today to present offers to the European Commission (EC) to make changes to Amazon's business in the E.U. market. Amazon is apparently opting not to cave to that pressure.\n\nRecall in November, the EC issued a \"statement of objections\" to Amazon's deal to acquire iRobot -- best known for its Roomba line of robotic vacuum cleaners (RVCs) -- detailing its view that the purchase could restrict competition in the market for RVCs.\n\nDid Amazon just call the EC's bluff?\n\nAs it stands, the EC has set a deadline of Feb. 14, 2024, to approve or deny the acquisition. By choosing not to offer any proposed changes to its business in Europe, however, Amazon significantly increased the risk that regulators might decide to strike down the deal.\n\nAt the same time, however, Reuters previously reported that EC lawyers were initially opposed to sending the statement of objections to Amazon in the first place, arguing the acquisition posed no competitive threat and should be cleared on an unconditional basis. With that in mind, perhaps this is more a case of Amazon calling regulators' bluffs and assuming the deal will get cleared regardless.\n\nIf that happens -- and with iRobot stock now trading at a more than 40% discount to the agreed acquisition price -- this could be an interesting bit of merger arbitrage for investors willing to make a speculative bet the deal goes through.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iRobot right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iRobot, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and iRobot wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Luxury conglomerate LVMH is in discussions with TikTok and its parent company ByteDance Ltd. on a plan for limiting counterfeit products sold on the popular video-sharing app.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff SEC Authorizes Bitcoin-Spot ETFs in Crypto’s Breakthrough SEC Says FBI Is Investigating Compromise of Agency’s X Account Boeing CEO Fights Back Tears and Admits ‘Our Mistake’ in 737 Address\n\nThe aim is to work together to achieve an “elevated shopping experience” as TikTok expands its marketplace globally, said Toto Haba, senior vice president of global omni-marketing for Benefit Cosmetics, a beauty brand owned by LVMH, Europe’s largest luxury company.\n\nThe parent group also includes 74 other brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Tiffany & Co. and TAG Heuer. The luxury group has an agreement in place with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to fight fake goods on its online Tmall marketplace, Haba said.\n\nThe deal could be a major move to help TikTok Shop’s reputation among brands and shoppers in key new markets. The company fully launched shopping in the US last year and already has ambitious targets, aiming to increase the size of its American e-commerce business 10-fold to as much as $17.5 billion in 2024, Bloomberg has reported, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nRead More: TikTok Eyes $17.5 Billion Shopping Business on Amazon’s Turf (2)\n\nA TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nOnline marketplaces like Amazon.com Inc., JD.com and Alibaba’s Tmall have long seen sellers hawking counterfeit products at very low prices, combating them with varying degrees of success. Such products deceive customers into paying for something inauthentic and deter brands from selling on the platform that hosts them because it can erode the value of the real product.\n\n“It’s important for us to guard our IP” on TikTok Shop, Haba said. The company is already flagging suspicious-looking Benefit-branded products to the company. “TikTok and ByteDance seem much more willing to talk with us on that and set the right guardrails.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the US, TikTok Shop works as an integrated part of the social media app’s video feed — with select users and brands able to tag and sell products through their videos — and in a designated tab that looks more like a typical e-commerce site. In the first holiday shopping season for the effort, 150,000 merchants and creators posted videos during the month, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, TikTok has said, leading to more than 5 million new customers.\n\nThere are a number of large brands like Benefit or fashion retailer Revolve that have been quick to sell on the app in the US, but many others have been slower to join the commerce operation.\n\nThird-party sellers can list items that they don’t personally produce, sometimes at discount prices that can raise questions about whether the product is real, Bloomberg reported in September.\n\nRead More: TikTok’s New Amazon Copycat is Full of Cheap Chinese Goods (1)\n\nPre-owned items are also sold. Take Louis Vuitton: The LVMH brand has a verified TikTok account and posts videos, but doesn’t list its own products. However, products labeled as Louis Vuitton still appear on the marketplace for US users. A search for the correct spelling of the brand name surfaces only one wallet that bears the brand name in the item description and a slew of non-branded handbags and other products. If you misspell the brand, using “Luis” instead, dozens of bags described as pre-owned appear on the TikTok Shop.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTrumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election US Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China’s War Machine Tropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Comes Under a Microscope Five ETFs to Watch in 2024\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

That's sort of what I'm thinking about last year. If you remember January 1023, it was kind of a similar story. OK, a couple companies rightsizing, we're wondering if everything's going to turn south. It didn't last year. Just a couple headlines for now, not really broad-based layoffs that we're seeing across the labor market, but perhaps something to watch moving forward.\n\nMADISON MILLS: Definitely something to watch, especially when you think about BlackRock, because they noted that this is definitely a direct result of the switch to passive versus active investing, which I found so interesting. Are we starting to see important figures on Wall Street embrace this idea that passive investing is winning out on a lot of retail investors, and that's leading to less of a need for them to have as much staff on hold?\n\nStory continues\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: The Twitch stuff really interesting there, because I thought that business was really successful. They paid out $1 billion in fees to their streamers. But I guess high overhead costs, high technology costs not going to work for them. And they kind of got to slim down.\n\nAnd I think you're right, Josh. I think this is the beginning of another wave of layoffs. I mean, just right when we thought the end of the year happened, fresh slate, no. More layoffs, more layoffs.\n\nMADISON MILLS: I don't know, though, because I feel like-- I was listening to Dana Pederson talking about this earlier today, an economist. And she was saying that if you feel like the economy is really bad if your industry is impacted. So I feel like for us, media layoffs happen literally every day. So for us, maybe it feels like this is going to start to be a bigger thing. But I don't know, it feels a little bit idiosyncratic still to me. I guess we'll have to see.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Initial jobless claims, our favorite-- our favorite indicator in that case, staying right about flat, at about 210,000 per week, Pras.",

        "title": "7 Stable Stocks to Buy No Matter What Happens to Interest Rates",
        "content": "While avoiding a recession last year boosted sentiment for 2024, concerned investors may still want to consider stable stocks. You just don’t know what might happen next. For example, who would have thought that the regional banking crisis would erupt? And the worrisome thing is that some experts believe we’re not necessarily out of the woods yet.\n\nAlso, targeting interest rate-proof stocks presents a sensible strategy because of certain conflicting economic data. Mainly, the U.S. jobs market continues to astound onlookers with its resilience. But with more dollars chasing after fewer goods, that might not be an appropriate time to lower interest rates. After all, that would presumably accelerate inflation.\n\nNow, I’m not going to whip out a crystal ball and start making a bunch of predictions. They’ll probably be wrong anyways. What I am arguing for is diversification. Go ahead and add some speculative ideas to your portfolio. But also keep in mind these stable stocks to buy. Again, you just never know what may lie around the corner.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHome Depot (HD) an interior view of a house attic under construction\n\nSource: ronstik / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou gotta love Home Depot (NYSE:HD) as one of the stable stocks to put in your portfolio. No, it’s not the most exciting enterprise – not even close. However, the reality is that the smelly stuff tends to arise when you own a home.\n\nAnd by the way, people bought a ton of homes during the low-interest-rate environment of 2020 and 2021. These new homeowners are probably now finding out how much of a pain the American Dream really is.\n\nWell, you can cry about it or you can go to Home Depot. We’re talking about pure relevance here, making it one of the top interest rate proof stocks. Moreover, the company doesn’t just benefit from the everyday stuff that can go awry. Hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters are always awaiting homeowners in certain regions. Unless you envision a future where weather events go away, HD is permanently relevant.\n\nStory continues\n\nOh yeah, analysts love it, rating shares a consensus moderate buy with a max price target of $387.\n\nDuke Energy (DUK) The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nUtility giant Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) offers multiple advantages for stable stocks to buy. First, as a utility company, it benefits from “legalized extortion,” if you will. That sounds really awful but what I’m trying to say is that you can shirk your utility bills. Otherwise, the power goes out and that’s not something you want in a modern economy where everything is digitalized.\n\nSecond, Duke benefits from a natural monopoly. Because of the high barriers to entry – including stiff regulations – Duke is effectively entrenched in its core markets. And those markets (in the southern and eastern regions of the U.S.) are viable due to migration trends among millennials. Due to cost-of-living considerations, Duke is positioned where the money will be.\n\nFurther, the company makes a great case for interest rate proof stocks because of its forward dividend yield of 4.14%. If rates decline, Duke’s passive income will look mighty attractive. If rates stay the same or even increase, the company’s permanently relevant business model should shine.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food giant McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) needs no introduction. It’s not just a sterling name among the broader retail brands. Rather, it’s a symbol of American-style capitalism. Therefore, I see McDonald’s as a permanently relevant idea for stable stocks. You’re probably not going to get rich off the idea. However, the global ubiquity of the Golden Arches makes it a comforting play in your portfolio.\n\nLook at it this way. When interest rates shift significantly, they impact investments and also purchases of big-ticket items. Again, real estate boomed during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic. Basically, the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates lower. However, purchases of expensive items began taking a backseat once policymakers adopted a hawkish stance.\n\nIn other words, money became expensive and there was an incentive to save. However, that shouldn’t affect McDonald’s, where the underlying comfort food is (relatively) dirt cheap. And people will always want a gastronomic pick-me-up. Thus, MCD ranks among the interest rate proof stocks.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a grocery giant, Kroger (NYSE:KR) makes an excellent case for stable stocks to buy. At the most cynical level, people need to eat. And therefore, Kroger benefits from the trade-down effect. That’s the phenomenon where consumers decline cutting spending cold turkey. Instead, they continue to spend but seek cheaper alternatives. Once an acceptable equilibrium between quality and price is met, they dive in.\n\nHere’s the deal with KR stock: the underlying company effectively sits near the lowest rung of the trade-down ladder. Can you go lower than Kroger? Sure, you have discount dollar stores that offer $1 bread. I’m just not sure you’d want to eat such products unless you absolutely had to. And given the robust nature of the jobs market, that doesn’t seem to be the case.\n\nAlso, the clear advantage that Kroger has over the competition is its valuation. Right now, shares trade at a forward earnings multiple of 10.57X, lower than the sector median 15.7X. Also, the market prices KR at a trailing-year sales multiple of 0.23X, even though the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.3%, well above industry average. Thus, it’s one of the interest rate proof stocks.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) Albuquerque, New Mexico / USA - November 2 2020: Boxes of Band-Aids in Walmart in the pharmacy and over-the-counter medication aisle. Kenvue (KVUE) split from JNJ and now owns the Band-aid brand.\n\nSource: Giovanni Nastukov / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve been talking about Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) in multiple contexts so I don’t want to keep going down the same well. However, I really like KVUE as one of the stable stocks to buy, perhaps more so than Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Don’t get me wrong, I love J&J. However, it’s difficult to say that everyone would have access to the company’s pharmaceutical and medical technology units.\n\nOn the flipside, I have supreme confidence in Kenvue. I have this confidence because somewhere right now, someone just got a boo-boo: a papercut, a bee sting, whatever. And I also know that someone got sick or has a headache (from reading my articles, perhaps!). These folks will turn to consumer health products. And more than likely, I’d wager, they’re going to turn to brands they trust.\n\nWhen you think about these brands – Band-Aid, Tylenol – we reach for them not just because we know them. They’re practically ingrained in our culture, our psyche. And so, when Precedence Research predicts that the global consumer healthcare market will hit $608.39 billion by 2032, Kenvue brands will likely be in the lead.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you’re considering stable stocks for your portfolio, you generally think about boring enterprises. Frankly, it doesn’t get much more boring than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Yes, the company did gain over 64% in the past 52 weeks: let’s give credit where it’s due. However, there’s some skepticism about whether it can pull off another brilliant run in 2024.\n\nStill, if you had to go long for the long term, MSFT represents a very sensible bet. You can even set aside all the investments it has made in generative artificial intelligence. When it comes to nuts and bolts of academia and the professional ecosystem, the world runs on Microsoft. For example, Microsoft Windows dominates market share of desktop operating systems at 72.79%. The others don’t come close.\n\nWhat does that tell you? Well, when people exchange spreadsheets and documents, they’re probably Microsoft-manufactured programs. Such dominance is probably not going to change anytime soon. Notably, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy, making it one of the interest rate proof stocks to consider.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you think of e-commerce, you think of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Basically, e-commerce as a concept has become synonymous with the Amazon brand. Conspicuously, AMZN gained over 68% of equity value in the past 52 weeks, a blistering performance. As such, it might seem unlikely that AMZN could deliver the goods again. However, I’d give it a strong look if you’re worried about interest-rate fluctuations.\n\nFor one thing, e-commerce transactions as a percentage of total retail sales continues to rise since the second quarter of 2022. Back then, the metric sat at 14.4%. In Q3 of last year, the index improved to 15.6%. That demonstrates that consumers still gravitate toward the convenience of online retail. As well, they’re buying products online even as interest rates rose.\n\nFor instance, the personal saving rate jumped from 3.4% in December 2022 to 5.3% in May 2023. That’s understandable because money became more expensive; thus, a reason for saving greenbacks existed. So, even with a tough consumer backdrop, e-commerce sales soard.\n\nBasically, Amazon is interest rate agnostic. In that case, it’s one of the stable stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wells Fargo: U.S. Residential Solar Sector To Outperform in 2024",
        "content": "Last year proved to be a banner year for the U.S. solar sector, with installed capacity rocketing 55% Y/Y to a record 33 GW, driven by robust growth by residential solar and high energy prices. It’s something of a minor miracle that the sector was able to record that kind of growth at a time when interest rates were going through the roof. The 10-year treasury yield jumped from half a percentage point in 2020 to just under five-percentage points in November 2023 as the Federal Reserve hiked rates to combat stubbornly high inflation in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the strong growth in installed capacity, solar stocks were badly hammered with the sector’s favorite benchmark, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), crashing nearly 26% in 2023.\n\nLast month, the solar and clean energy sector went wild after the Fed announced that it will keep short-term interest rates unchanged and penciled in three cuts in the current year, a potentially very bullish development for 2024. Unfortunately, solar stocks can’t seem to catch a proper break with the TAN ETF down 10.9% just 10 days into the new year. Perhaps this has got something to do with a December report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie that predicted the U.S. solar sector will record a more modest 10% growth in installed capacity in 2024, with high-interest rates and the net metering policy in California seen as key headwinds. It’s also worth noting that interest rates have started creeping up with the markets on edge due to the uncertainty surrounding precisely when the Federal will start cutting rates. Further, the central bank has cautioned about the lingering possibility of a mild recession.\n\nSolar installations, especially in the rooftop market, tend to be highly sensitive to interest rates. That’s the case because customers usually sign a 20- to 30-year purchase agreement to buy solar electricity from an installer, with no down payment. The installer then sells off any upfront subsidies and tax benefits  and finances those long-term payments similar to what happens with mortgages or bonds. Higher interest rates squeeze margins for solar installers and sometimes forces them to counter by increasing prices. This is basically what has been ailing the solar sector over the past couple of years.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S. 10 Year Treasury Yield\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nBut high interest rates do not hurt solar manufacturers alone: according to the  International Energy Agency (IEA), a 5% increase in interest rates leads to a 33% increase in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from wind and solar but only marginally for natural gas plants.\n\nThankfully for solar bulls, part of Wall Street remains bullish: Wells Fargo has predicted that solar stocks will rebound in 2024 with residential solar expected to outperform its utility-scale brethren due to their greater interest rate sensitivity.\n\n\"We expect residential solar to outperform utility-scale solar in 2024 given resi-solar's relative sensitivity to interest rate movements. We also expect resi solar to see a greater rate of change for growth given higher attach rates. In addition, key solar states (e.g. CA) are seeing sizable increases to utility rates this year, which should further support resi-solar economics in a falling rate environment,\" Wells Fargo has explained.\n\nThe Wall Street analysts have upgraded shares of Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) and Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) to Overweight. ENPH price target has been raised to $141 from $98, good for 20.5% upside to current price while NXT has been lifted to $57 from $45, good for 35.7% upside. The firm has downgraded shares of First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) to Equal Weight and cut the price target to $187 from $215, still good for 12.7% upside while SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) has been downgraded to Underweight And the price target cut to $4 from $6, good for a mere 2.3% upside.\n\nQcells To Supply Microsoft With 12 Gigawatts Of American Solar Panels\n\nSouth Korea’s solar equipment manufacturer Qcells has entered an agreement with U.S. enterprise software giant Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT) to supply the tech company with 12 Gigawatts of solar panels through 2032 in what has been hailed as one of the biggest deals of its kind. That’s enough solar energy to power nearly 2 million homes. Microsoft hopes the deal will help it achieve its ambitious goal to power its operations with 100% clean energy by 2025. Microsoft is the owner of Microsoft Azure, the second-largest of the top three public cloud platforms on the platform behind Amazon’s Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. Data centers are some of the most power-hungry operations today, consuming nearly 5% of global electricity output.\n\n\"How do we really make sure that we can meet those goals in this kind of an environment, as we see others coming in and doing the same thing? We have to really undertake things in a very strategic and thoughtful way,\"  Bobby Hollis, Microsoft's vice president for energy, has said in an interview.\n\nOn its part, Qcells hopes that the collaboration with Microsoft will help the company create a solar supply chain in the United States that can compete with China.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nChina Looks To Play Peacemaker in the Middle East U.S., UK Shoot Down 21 Drones in Red Sea PJM: Electrification Will Raise Power Demand Peaks in the Long Term\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com",

        "title": "5 A-Rated Stocks to Buy ASAP in 2024",
        "content": "Right around this time last year, InvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango made 10 big predictions for the stock market. His boldest included forecasting that 2023 would be one of the best years for stocks in history.\n\nNine of the 10 predictions came true!\n\nThat’s because Luke recognized that the Federal Reserve has an outsized role in how stocks are valued. During the “free money” era of 2020-2022, assets with near-zero values like NFTs and “meme” stocks skyrocketed. Everyone seemed to have cash to spare, and a large chunk went into worthless assets. As the Fed tightened its policy in late 2022, these moonshots came falling back to Earth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLuke’s 10 predictions were made under the assumption that the Fed would stop tightening in 2023. And he was right.\n\nAs we look into 2024, a new era of the stock market will begin: The return to normalcy.\n\nAnd that means earnings will take center stage.\n\nIt’s that simple. Strong firms that generate lots of distributable cash flows will see their values rise this year. And weak ones that burn cash will get punished. That’s what “normal” stock markets look like, and that’s what the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com, our free news site, expect for 2024.\n\nThere will always be periods of rampant speculation that make people forget this. Dutch tulips in the 1600s could be worth as much as an entire house, and so could NFTs in 2020. But 2024 is shaping up to be a year when the Fed steps back, giving investors the opportunity to take a hard look at their holdings and reward the ones with the strongest outlooks.\n\nCharging Up\n\nNowhere is this clearer than at solid-state battery developer QuantumScape (NYSE:QS). The 14-year-old startup went public in 2020 and has survived so far thanks to the $1.5 billion it raised during the years of loose monetary policy.\n\nBut easy money is coming to an end. As Dana Blankenhorn writes in a recent InvestorPlace.com article, patience is wearing thin for QuantumScape and its rapid cash burn.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe San Jose company said it was close to production last year. Then CEO Jagdeep Singh said improvements would be needed first… But promises won’t work anymore.\n\nThe problem is, we’ve heard this all before. QuantumScape burned through $350 million in cash over the last year without delivering a product. Full production could still be years away… If QuantumScape can’t get something into production this year, perhaps it never will. That’s the way science works. Some paths lead to dead ends.\n\nWe’re already seeing these effects. This week, options prices of QuantumScape surged as traders placed bets on both sides. Implied volatility – a measure of options pricing – now sits three times higher than it did just a month ago.\n\nOf course, QuantumScape is a tricky investment because no one knows whether the company’s earnings will skyrocket or go nowhere. Blankenhorn gives QuantumScape a 50-50 shot of success, calling it “a speculation, not an investment.”\n\nBut other companies have far more predictable outlooks and are much surer bets…\n\n5 A-Rated Stocks to Buy\n\nLouis Navellier, another InvestorPlace analyst, has been perfecting his system since the 1970s, a time when “quant” investing was still mostly a theory. Since then, he’s developed a powerful Portfolio Grader system that many readers will be familiar with. By taking thousands of data points and combining it with years of stock market knowledge, he’s produced a quantitative system that separates promising companies from the duds.\n\nHis system is now flagging a handful of high-quality firms with rising earnings momentum and positive revisions. These are some of the most powerful predictors of future stock movements, and investors should expect these companies to do particularly well in 2024.\n\nOur writers at InvestorPlace.com also agree. This week, they highlight many of Louis’ top-ranked stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA recent spate of earnings upgrades now puts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a solid A-grade stock, up from an F grade as recently as last March.\n\nNot only is the tech giant riding a massive wave of cloud computing demand, but CEO Andy Jassy has refocused the company away from the low-return business of physical stores to the high-return one of generative AI.\n\nThat’s put Amazon solidly on Terel Miles’ list of “3 AI Stocks to Make You the Millionaire Next Door”:\n\nThe company recently announced a strategic collaboration with generative AI startup, Anthropic. This included an investment of up to $4 billion, leveraging AWS Tranium and Inferentia Chips to build, train, and deploy advanced foundational models… This makes Amazon one of the best millionaire-maker AI stocks to buy for 2024.\n\nAnalysts now believe that Amazon will earn $3.61 per share in fiscal 2024, up from initial estimates of $2.40 made last year. The average earnings revision is up 5% in the past 30 days, a highly bullish signal. Though the Fed’s “easy money” years might be behind it, Amazon is making up the difference by focusing on the high-return worlds of cloud computing and AI to drive earnings growth.\n\nAppLovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nIn December, Yiannis Zourmpanos noted for InvestorPlace.com that mobile app software firm AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) was delivering key support for its value growth:\n\nIn Q3 2023, revenue grew by [21% year-over-year], and adjusted EBITDA soared with a significant 63% sequential rise. The growth figures exceeded the company’s high-end guidance, affirming the success of AXON 2, its AI-based advertising technology\n\nEssentially, AppLovin has seen significant demand for its software platform revenue, which has allowed management to reduce spending on marketing its less lucrative in-app services. Analysts now expect AppLovin to deliver $1.60 earnings per share (EPS), a 2X upward revision since the start of 2023.\n\nThese improving figures have not escaped Louis’ Portfolio Grader. AppLovin now scores a solid A in his system, up from an F a year ago. Analysts expect to see 31% revenue growth and 267% earnings growth when the Silicon Valley-based firm next reports in mid-February.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) was upgraded to an A rating in December after a series of earnings revisions. Wall Street analysts now expect the customer relationship management software firm to generate $9.56 EPS in fiscal 2024, a figure that has been steadily revised upward from $7 last year.\n\nSalesforce’s growth has been so strong that Alex Sirois now names Salesforce as one of his top AI stocksripe to be one of the next Magnificent 7.\n\n“I think there are two primary reasons for investors to consider Salesforce at the moment,” Sirois writes. “First of all, the company is doing well on a fundamental basis. During the most recent quarter, the company’s earnings per share exceeded expectations on revenues that increased by 11.5%. Further, Salesforce has invested in AI and includes services such as Salesforce Einstein and Einstein GPT.”\n\nThat’s because Salesforce is a leader in productivity-enhancing AI. Customers can now use Einstein to summarize emails and draft responses. And as artificial intelligence continues to improve, investors can expect Salesforce to become an indispensable tool in empowering its customers to do more.\n\nTrex (TREX) Residential neighborhood subdivision skyline Aerial shot\n\nSource: TDKvisuals / Shutterstock.com\n\nLuke predicts that 2024 will be a year of a housing rebound. As he writes in Innovation Investor, lower mortgage rates in 2024 could unlock a surge of demand, and housing technology disruptors like Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ:OPEN) and Zillow Group (NASDAQ:Z) could soar.\n\nInvestors looking for a more conservative stock might also consider Trex (NYSE:TREX), a stable firm that has earned positive income in 24 of its 27 years as a public company. (In 2009, the firm lost $8 million.)\n\nTrex has managed to build a lasting competitive advantage by dominating the industry for high-end wood alternatives. The Winchester, Virginia-based firm has contracts with both Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and now holds a 50% market share in composites.\n\nA housing recovery now suggests that Trex could surprise even the most bullish of estimates. Last week, Portfolio Grader upgraded the firm from a B to an A on strong earnings growth and accelerating revenue growth. And if the housing market recovers as quickly as Luke expects, even Wall Street’s expectations for an 18% rise in Trex’s EPS will prove too low.\n\nBoston Scientific (BSX) a zoom-in on the Boston Scientific logo (BSX) on a web page\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Josh Enomoto picks Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) this week as a top trailblazer in AI. Despite valuation concerns, Josh says the medical device developer could have a strong 2024 as its image analysis technologies mature:\n\nIt’s easily one of the relevant stock picks for 2024 just on its own without getting into the AI component. Analysts assign shares as a consensus strong buy with a $62.76 average price target. The high-side target clocks in at $77.\n\nOne of the more exciting arenas for digital intelligence centers on the broader medical field. For BSX specifically, it utilizes AI for medical image analyses. In addition, the company is leveraging the innovation for other functionalities within medtech, thus enhancing patient care. According to one report, the global AI healthcare market could expand at a CAGR of 40.2% to hit $173.55 billion by 2029.\n\nLouis’ grading system also gives Boston Scientific a strong B grade for its earnings growth, positive earnings momentum, and rapid operating margin growth. Analysts believe the Massachusetts-based firm will see earnings per share rise 15% this year, and another 12% in fiscal 2024 – a remarkable achievement for a historically stable grower.\n\nPredicting Earnings\n\nSo far, I’ve only talked about BIG PICTURE earnings increases. We know that housing companies will see earnings rise in 2024 as housing demand picks up. And we know that a pivot toward AI productivity tools will benefit Salesforce and other AI-forward firms. These sectors are riding multiyear megatrends.\n\nBut what if you could predict earnings to a finer degree? Rather than saying “Salesforce earnings will go up,” what if we knew exactly where these figures would land?\n\nObviously, this information would be a game-changer. Anyone knowing precise earnings figures could score 10%… 20%… 30% gains in a day during earnings season. And they would know long before earnings day to sell out of a sinking stock.\n\nFortunately, we now have a tool for this (and it doesn’t involve insider trading). To help you learn more, Louis is hosting an event on Tuesday, January 9, at 8 p.m. Eastern (sign up here), where they’ll reveal a remarkable advance in predictive market power.

        "title": "Don’t Bet on Tech M&amp;A Wave Following HPE-JNPR Deal",
        "content": "We have our first big merger of 2024. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) is buying Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) for about $14 billion. News of the possible deal leaked Tuesday, sending Juniper shares up more than 20%. The stock was up another 2% Wednesday once the news was official. HPE, on the other hand, tumbled 9% Tuesday due to concerns about the deal price and strategic rationale, before recovering a bit Wednesday.\n\nOn the surface, buying Juniper does seem to make some sense for HPE, which has been looking to further bolster its networking business following its 2015 deal for Aruba Networks. Juniper is particularly attractive to HPE thanks to its own deal in 2019 to buy Mist Systems, a leader in both cloud and artificial intelligence networking. (Cloud computing and AI were arguably the biggest and buzziest trends in tech in 2023 and that shows no signs of slowing down this year.)\n\nBut should investors start speculating on a new wave of consolidation in the rest of the networking industry or broader tech sector? Probably not.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDon’t Bet on Tech Stocks Tie-Ups in 2024\n\nYes, many tech giants (especially the Magnificent 7 of the Nasdaq) had phenomenal years last year. But even these tech juggernauts are taking a more cautious approach to 2024. Witness the layoffs that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced Wednesday for its Prime Video and MGM Studios units and cuts at Amazon-owned video game streaming service Twitch.\n\nWorries about last year’s interest rate hikes making acquisitions more expensive and the possibility of more regulations and antitrust crackdowns on the tech industry in Washington aren’t helping matters either. Those are just some of the reasons that tech M&A volume was, to quote research firm CB Insights, “subdued”, in 2023 and may not recover much this year.\n\nIt’s also not clear if other top networking companies even have the appetite to do big deals right now since several are still digesting other major mergers. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is yet to close on the $28 billion acquisition of software company Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) that it announced last September. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) just closed its deal for VMWare late last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s also uncertain if other big tech firms like Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) or Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) will be looking to spend cash for splashy deals either.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWith that in mind, it’s worth pointing out that the stocks of several other smaller Juniper rivals, such as Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR), Ubiquiti (NYSE:UI) and Cambium Networks (NASDAQ:CMBM) have not rallied in the past few days as the market was speculating about a Juniper takeover. It appears that Wall Street and Silicon Valley are not expecting a rush to consolidate, despite the HPE-JNPR deal. Big Tech may not have the urge to merge after all.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

        "title": "The Top 7 AI Stocks (Not Named Nvidia) to Start 2024",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was by far the best AI stock of 2023. 2023 is over, but it was the year that artificial intelligence took off. AI stocks are facing something of a different environment in 2024.\n\nThe evolution of the sector continues and investors continue to seek higher sales as the leading indicator of success. By the way, that’s why Nvidia did so well last year: Demand for its products spiked sales while many other firms have yet to see top line results from AI.\n\nYet, other AI stocks continue to have plenty of potential to not only increase sales but to rise in price for other reasons. This article is dedicated to those firms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors just got a great chance to pick up AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock at lower prices. 2024 has started with something of a correction, especially in regard to tech and AI shares. The result is that AMD shares have fallen from $150 to $137 as I write this.\n\nMake no mistake about it, the so-called correction is primarily a result of investors securing gains immediately after the calendar tax year ends. It is not a reflection of the purported beginning of some long-term AI correction in 2024. That’s how I feel anyway and the fact that AMD shares are rebounding seem to confirm my suspicion.\n\nI continue to argue that AMD is the number one contender in the AI space at the moment. The company will release its mi300 chips at some point in 2024. That will give the firm’s shares a very strong positive catalyst in their favor. It’s very evident that the top tech firms across Silicon Valley are interested in the chips as a way to reduce costs as an alternative to Nvidia’s highly priced h100 chips.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a very good year for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and owners of its stock. Like every other share on this list, Broadcom is cheaper at the moment than it was just a week ago. That’s obviously an opportunity for all investors and arguably a reason to pick up AVGO shares in and of itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, I would argue that investors should pick up Broadcom because its acquisition of VMware and the finalization thereof, promises to make 2024 very strong. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware was finalized in November after much concern. Finalization of the deal was delayed three times. It’s very apparent that regulators worry about the potential of the company to become monopolistic in nature. Now that it’s been given approval and acquired VMware it should also be apparent that the company has been transformed.\n\nThat truth is reflected by the company’s guidance for the 4th quarter of a 40% increase in revenues, in part due to its VMware acquisition. The company is the leader in software infrastructure in the AI space, now has a much greater top line, and continues to pay investors a strong dividend that is growing rapidly.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominates many niches throughout the tech sector. The company carved out a spot in 2023 and into 2024 as a leader in AI. It’s hard to talk about AI stocks without mentioning Microsoft. There are dozens of reasons to potentially invest in Microsoft, AI being one of them. Here’s how I look at Microsoft in relation to artificial intelligence.\n\nOf course, OpenAI has dominated the conversation in relation to Microsoft and AI. Microsoft’s investment and integration of ChatGPT across its services was and remains the major story. Yet, Microsoft doesn’t, or hasn’t yet, benefited much from its investments on a top line basis.\n\nMicrosoft rebounded in 2023 with revenues up 13% and income increasing by 27% in the most recent earnings report. I think the increase in income is an important aspect to focus on. Microsoft has invested in applying AI to its suite of Office products which promises to increase efficiency at firms everywhere. That’s where I see the benefit of Microsoft’s AI prowess at the moment: the company helps other companies increase their efficiency thereby improving their respective bottom lines. In turn, that should increase Microsoft’s top line.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) drastically turned around in 2023 as the macroeconomic picture stabilized. Revenues are again strong across its family of apps business, which is the primary reason to invest in the company overall. Of course, interest rates are very likely to be slashed multiple times in 2024 and that again should pave the way for stronger ad revenues in the new year. In other words, there is a lot of reason for optimism around META stock currently.\n\nOne thing that arguably gets lost in the conversation surrounding Meta Platforms is just how much the company has invested in artificial intelligence. Make no mistake about it, the company has invested as much as anyone else in AI.\n\nIt’s no secret that Nvidia’s h100 chips are in high demand. However, it may come as a surprise to understand just how much of that Supply Meta Platforms procured. Nvidia sold roughly half a million of those chips during the most recent quarter. Of that, Meta and Microsoft bought roughly 60%, with 150,000 chips each.\n\nInvestors should expect the company’s Llama 2 large language model (LLM) to garner more and more attention in 2024.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA lot of times, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) gets relegated to the tier of has been in relation to chips and AI stocks. It was overtaken by AMD In late 2022 and has been playing catch up since.\n\nOne of the primary reasons to believe that Intel will be able to make headway in that regard in 2024 relates to AI and personal computers. Both Intel and AMD are releasing AI-enabled processors for the PC market in 2024. Those chips include something called a neural processing unit (NPU) which is integrated into the CPU.\n\nEssentially, NPU chips are more powerful and better suited to AI applications and promise to bring a wave of AI capability to PCs this year.\n\nThe release of those chips promises to make Intel interesting again after what was arguably a difficult 2023. During the most recent quarter, revenues slipped by 8%. Although the result was above guidance, it’s difficult to argue that declining revenues are a win. NPU chips promise to change that.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSimply put, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock continues to brim with massive potential as we move into 2024. I’d argue that as much as any other AI share, Snowflake has deep potential to provide massive returns.\n\nFew other firms are comparable to Snowflake in regard to scale and growth potential. More succinctly, SNOW is very well positioned to benefit from the resurgence of growth stocks in 2024. That resurgence will be prompted by the Federal rate cuts, which almost always galvanize growth stocks higher.\n\nSnowflake reported nearly $700 million in product revenue in the most recent quarter, rising by 34%. That’s an impressive rate of growth especially in consideration of the company’s size. Investors are well aware of the opportunity presented by the application of AI across data centers.\n\nHowever, I think some may not be aware of how much this company’s shares have fallen during this macroeconomic cycle. Shares were about well above $300 in 2021. It’s easy to argue that they have the potential to return there as the macroeconomic environment shifts back in its favor.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) approach to AI is heavily focused on training as many people as possible in artificial intelligence. Over the last few months a series of articles were written that all focus on the notion that Amazon is positioned to help prepare  the current workforce as AI evolves.\n\nThe company’s ‘AI Ready’ program aims to train 2 million people with the requisite AI skills necessary for the labor market by 2025. More information about that program can be found here. The purported benefits are expected to cut both ways: employers will get employees who are more able to adapt to the AI-dominated environments, and employees will be able to command greater salaries.\n\nIf you think about it, it’s a smart move that it could really move the needle for Amazon. The broader the net a company can cast, the better the potential returns are to the top line. Further, I think the most obvious potential of AI and the one that is nearest to fruition is the ability of AI to drastically improve efficiency of employees, not replace them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Small-Cap Stocks With Huge Potential Flying Under the Radar",
        "content": "Small-cap stocks are set to have their day in the sun this year, and not just because favorable economic and monetary policy conditions are set to put wind in their sales. Instead, investors are increasingly nervous about the high-flying large- and mega-cap tech stocks that beat all odds to rally substantially in 2023.\n\nBut the rally that sent the Nasdaq 100 soaring nearly 50% in 2023 came with a price – overvaluation. Today, the index’s average price-to-earnings ratio sits at a whopping 29.15, indicating that the tech giants might have rebounded too much, too quickly. By comparison, the small-cap index S&P 600’s P/E ratio stands at a comparatively slim 16.\n\nOf course, high rates put pressure on small caps, so the relatively low share pricing reflects economic finagling. But, if and when the Fed cuts rates (or just pauses their growth), expect small caps to surpass large caps’ performance quickly. Among those small-cap stocks, these represent the best bang for your buck, blending growth and value.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nClearPoint Neuro (CLPT) healthcare stocks: doctors posing. retirement stocks. Healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nClearpoint Neuro (NASDAQ:CLPT) started the year with a bang, as the small-cap healthcare stock reported its strongest year-end earnings in quite some time. The brain-focused HealthTech stock saw 2023 close with a 17% annual revenue increase, with biologics and drug delivery sales jumping nearly 50%. Better yet, most of that growth came from the year’s final quarter, which marked a 32% revenue increase and a 76% sales increase from biologics and drug delivery. Closing out 2023 with that kind of strength points to solid tailwinds for this small-cap stock in 2024. Though shares surged more than 10% on the heels of the solid earnings report, there’s still upside to be had.\n\n2024 marks a range of operational milestones the company expects to hit. These include FDA clearance for the company’s brain navigation visual interface, full marketization of its laser therapy system, and AI-enabled predictive modeling platform launches. If even a handful of CLPT’s lofty goals come to fruition in 2024, the small-cap stock could be one of the year’s best performers.\n\nStory continues\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) is a bit of a dark horse among small-cap stocks, as the company suffered mightily in 2023, and a wave of bearish sentiment keeps shares suppressed today. Detractors point to slowing installation rates, liquidity concerns and struggles to compete with Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) charging network. All are, of course, fair points. But if you want to bet on a stock set to surge if the Fed cuts rates, CHPT is a clear winner.\n\nChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer told reporters that the past few quarters represented a “wait and see” inflection point rather than a full operational downturn. He said, referencing the company’s prospects for 2024, “It’s getting better, as we’re getting more and more data around the economy, and it appears we’re heading for a soft landing.”\n\nElectrical charger installation is a costly endeavor, especially when competing with a giant like Tesla that can subsidize footprint expansion through car sales. But falling rates open new liquidity opportunities that, in turn, could kickstart rapid network expansion for ChargePoint.\n\nAehr Test Systems (AEHR) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) is set to capitalize on continued semiconductor enthusiasm but, unlike its larger brothers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Aehr is agnostic to which company wins the proverbial chip arms race. That’s because Aehr develops and supplies testing systems to ensure semiconductor reliability and quality. As chips become smaller, more intricate, and expensive, demand for high-end and advanced testing systems will surge. And Aehr is one of the few small-cap stocks ready to run based on that opportunity.\n\nThe company’s top- and bottom-line stats climbed across the board, with revenue hitting 45% year-over-year growth and GAAP net income climbing 63%. In the call, CEO Gayn Erickson did point to some potential headwinds as “the slowing of the growth rate of the electric vehicle market has had a negative impact on the timing of several current and new customer orders.” But Aehr is far more than EVs, as the company tests chips associated with 5G tech, AI, machine learning, and more. If the company can move past its EV concerns, Aehr is set for a winning 2024.\n\nJumia Technologies (JMIA) Jumia (JMIA) banner at the New York Stock Exchange\n\nSource: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.com\n\nJumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) is one of those emerging market-centric stocks that could buck wider asset trends and significantly outperform comparable eCommerce platforms in 2024. Some call the small-cap tech stock the “Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa.” But unlike Amazon, Jumia can still tap a consumer market that’s 1.4 billion strong and otherwise largely unserviced.\n\nThe company saw a turbulent few years as factors, including the pandemic and financial struggles, kneecapped its growth. But that ship seems to have repositioned itself, and today, Jumia has cut cash burn, built liquidity to seven quarters’ worth of runway, and expanded its physical delivery footprint. While there’s still a long road to go, Jumia trades right around penny stock territory, making it a compelling speculative small-cap stock, especially considering the recent Morgan Stanley outlook upgrade.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications.

ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) saw shares surge last year as the small-cap space stock completed the world’s first satellite-to-cell phone 5G call between two remote, rural points without tower coverage. Once its product proved viable, ASTS quickly pivoted into marketization mode, though shares have fallen since the stock’s maiden flight.\n\nMuch of that share price turbulence came from funding concerns to push ASTS into wider markets to reach consumers. But that funding debacle seems to have been settled, as the company provided an interim update on its strategic financing initiatives. According to the release, ASTS bulls should see the strategic investment deal close later this month alongside the company breaking ground on planned commercial service stations based on customer orders.\n\nWhile recent weeks marked a brief pause for ASTS, this small-cap stock is one with massive upside potential in 2024 and beyond, making the suppressed share pricing an ideal entry opportunity.\n\nEnovix Corporation (ENVX) Solid State Battery for EV Electric Vehicle, new research and development batteries with solid electrolyte energy storage for automotive car industry, cathode. 3d illustration. Top Battery Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Just_Super / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnovix Corporation (NASDAQ:ENVX) is a small-cap battery stock competing against larger manufacturers like Tesla, but with a unique twist. Whereas larger manufacturers focus on reducing or eliminating rare-earth minerals, like Tesla did last year, Enovix is redesigning the entire concept of lithium-ion batteries. The company uses silicone to develop 3D structures that house batteries, making them smaller, nimbler, and cheaper – perfect for applications like smartphones and wearables.\n\nLast year, the company secured FDA approval to leverage its battery tech in vital sign monitoring systems. Enovix also locked down a solid US Army contract to develop batteries to run next-gen soldier wearables and advance defense tech.\n\nThough it saw those wins, Enovix remains firmly within the R&D space, though it’s beginning wider productization. Still, Enovix is a speculative small-cap stock, but as the company improves its innovative battery systems, total marketability could prove huge.\n\nRocket Lab (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) is set for a solid 2024 as the company secured a $515 million government contract to design and build 18 satellites over the next few years. Though the company marked two milestones last year — ten launches in a single year and the 42nd overall launch — this contract elevates Rocket Lab’s overall position within the wider space industry. No longer seen as a younger brother to mega-companies like SpaceX, the recent government stamp of approval proves this company has the competence and staying power to keep growing throughout the decade.\n\nRocket Lab also has a customer backlog of more than 40 satellites, proving the small-cap space stock’s newfound popularity among commercial and government customers and clients.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Amazon\n\nAmazon is cutting hundreds of jobs at Prime Video and James Bond studio MGM as the tech giant grapples with tough competition in the streaming market.\n\nIn a note to staff on Wednesday, seen by The Telegraph, the company said it was eliminating “several hundred roles” following a review of its TV and film output.\n\nMike Hopkins, Amazon’s streaming boss, wrote: “Throughout the past year, we’ve looked at nearly every aspect of our business with an eye towards improving our ability to deliver even more breakthrough movies, TV shows, and live sports in a personalised, easy to use entertainment experience for our global customers.\n\n“As a result, we’ve identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while increasing our investment and focus on content and product initiatives that deliver the most impact.”\n\nIt marks the latest round of cuts in Amazon’s streaming business after more than 100 employees were laid off early last year.\n\nIn addition to its popular Prime service, Amazon also boosted its production capabilities through an $8.5bn (£6.7bn) takeover of MGM Studios in 2022.\n\nMGM, which is celebrating its centenary this year, boasts a catalogue of more than 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows, including the James Bond franchise and recent hit Saltburn. Amazon took over MGM Studios, which produced recent hit Saltburn, in 2022 - Amazon\n\nBut growing competition from the likes of Netflix and Disney, coupled with rising interest rates and wider economic troubles, has sparked a retrenchment across the sector.\n\nStreaming services have begun hiking subscription prices, introduced ad-funded tiers and cracked down on password sharing in a bid to rekindle growth.\n\nFrom next month, Amazon will introduce adverts alongside its films and TV shows. Subscribers will be forced to pay an extra £2.99 to remain ad-free.\n\nHollywood has also been left reeling by protracted strikes by writers and actors unions, which shut down many productions last year and forced studios to push back releases.\n\nIn the note, Mr Hopkins said Amazon was focusing its investments on “initiatives that we know will move the needle” but did not specify where exactly the cuts would fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Netflix and Disney have outlined plans to slash their content budgets as the squeeze on finances forces the companies to focus on quality rather than quantity.\n\nAmazon insisted it would keep investing in programming, adding that its streaming service was one of the most popular benefits for Prime customers.\n\nIt comes amid broader cuts at Amazon as the economic downturn sparked a slew of layoffs across Silicon Valley. The tech giant slashed more than 25,000 roles last year in areas including cloud computing and advertising.",

        "title": "Jeff Bezos Made Over $7.9 Million An Hour Every Hour In 2023 — In Under 13 Minutes, He Brought In The Equivalent Of What The Typical Person Earns In A Lifetime",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc. Founder Jeff Bezos, a key figure in modern business, saw a massive increase in his net worth from $107 billion in early 2023 to $177 billion a year later, marking a $70 billion gain, according to Fortune. This equates to an increase of $191,780,822 per day or about $7,990,868 per hour.\n\nTo put this into perspective, Bezos earns the equivalent of the median lifetime earnings of a typical U.S. worker — $1.7 million in 2023 — in approximately 0.21 hours or about 12.76 minutes. In other words, what an average worker earns over an entire career, Bezos earns in just under 13 minutes.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nBezos’s wealth growth is mainly driven by his ownership of Amazon stock. Since Amazon’s initial public offering in 1997, the company has expanded significantly, not just in online retail but also in areas like cloud computing with Amazon Web Services and digital streaming. These expansions have continually pushed Amazon’s stock price upward, significantly impacting Bezos’s net worth. In 2023, Amazon’s retail e-commerce sales worldwide were projected to reach $746.22 billion, highlighting the company’s dominant position in the e-commerce sector.\n\nBezos received a total compensation of $1.7 for fiscal 2022. This total compensation package included a base salary of $81,840, with no bonuses, stock options or awarded stock. The remaining $1.6 million came from other types of compensation. Bezos’s base salary has remained unchanged since 1998.\n\nOver the years, Bezos has sold approximately $27 billion worth of Amazon stock, including a notable sale in 2010 of 6 million shares worth $793 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nApart from Amazon, Bezos has diversified his investments. He founded Blue Origin Enterprises, a private spaceflight company with ambitious goals like building space hotels and amusement parks. He also purchased The Washington Post in 2013 and has made investments in various other ventures, including Arrived Homes, a company that allows individuals to invest in rental properties for as little as $100.\n\nHis investments range from emerging technologies to traditional media, showcasing his ability to identify and capitalize on various business opportunities. This varied investment approach not only buffers his financial assets against market volatility but also positions him at the forefront of multiple pioneering industries.\n\nDespite criticism over his relatively low philanthropic giving compared to his net worth, Bezos has begun to increase his charitable contributions. In 2020, he committed $10 billion to the Bezos Earth Fund to combat climate change and has made donations to various causes including education and homelessness.\n\nWhile Bezos's financial achievements may seem beyond reach, they serve as a testament to the power of vision, innovation and persistence. His story offers hope and inspiration, reminding people that with dedication and strategic thinking, significant achievements are possible.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin.

This size recommendation system analyzes millions of data on style, size charts and customer reviews of various products, with the help of which it generates billions of size recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm continuously learns and adapts to the changes in customers’ size needs.\r\n\r\nAnother feature called Fit Review Highlights, which creates a review highlight for each customer based on their recommended size, is backed by large language models (“LLMs”). The feature offers personalized size guidance based on reviews from customers who have purchased the item in the same size.\r\n\r\nRe-imagined size charts, which are also powered by LLMs, are designed to improve the accuracy of size charts by extracting and cleaning size chart data from multiple sources.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Fit Insights Tool, which leverages an LLM model to extract and aggregate customer feedback on fit, style and fabric, contextualizes product returns and size chart analyses with customer reviews. It helps brands understand customer fit issues and reduce the number of related returns.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc.

Further, Prime Wardrobe shoppers get the option of a vast collection of clothes, shoes and accessories from numerous brands.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s augmented reality-powered interactive mobile experience, namely ‘Virtual Try-On for Shoes,’ remains noteworthy. The feature enables customers to check the look of a pair of shoes virtually from every angle just by tapping the “Virtual Try-On” button on the product details page and then pointing the camera at their feet.\r\n\r\nAll these endeavors will help Amazon penetrate rapidly into the booming online retail market for fashion, which, in turn, will benefit its e-commerce business, which remains its key growth driver and contributes maximum to its revenues.\r\n\r\nShares of Amazon have gained 68.5% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 36.7%.\r\n\r\nThe company’s deepening focus on enhancing its e-commerce experience on the back of advanced technologies is expected to aid its customer momentum, which, in turn, will drive growth in its online store sales.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos Says Amazon Has Had 'Plenty Of Practice' With Failure But Believes It Is 'The Best Place In The World To Fail'",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc.'s 2015 shareholders letter sheds light on the company's unique organizational culture, which has propelled the company to become the fastest ever to reach $100 billion in annual sales.\n\nAmazon Founder Jeff Bezos describes Amazon's culture as a blueprint for business success and a guide for embracing innovation and learning from failure. Amazon's success story, including the rapid growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is rooted in its corporate culture.\n\nBezos highlights the core principles of the company's culture, saying \"customer obsession rather than competitor obsession, eagerness to invent and pioneer, willingness to fail, the patience to think long-term and taking professional pride in operational excellence.\" These principles challenge the traditional corporate playbook, emphasizing long-term innovation and the acceptance of failure as a key component of progress.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nJeff Bezos called the meteoric success of this real estate investing strategy early on. He bet millions on the growth of fractional investing, and you can get in on the action with as little as $100. Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.\n\nAmazon's culture is unique for its blend of stability and adaptability. It thrives on attracting and retaining people who share a passion for pioneering and invention.\n\n\"Corporate cultures are enduring, stable, hard to change,\" Bezos wrote. \"They can be a source of advantage or disadvantage.\" Amazon's culture, therefore, is not just about the strategies it employs but also about the people who drive the strategies forward.\n\nA critical aspect where Amazon stands out is its approach to failure. “One area where I think we are especially distinctive is failure,” he wrote. “I believe we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's approach to experimentation, even when it leads to unsuccessful outcomes, is what fuels its innovation engine. The successes of AWS, Marketplace and Prime are a testament to Amazon's risk-taking culture. These ventures, initially seen as bold and unconventional, have become pillars of Amazon's business, showcasing the rewards of risk-taking and innovation.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon announced eight significant innovations, including expanding its drone delivery program, integrating new robotic systems and reducing packaging waste. These initiatives demonstrate Amazon’s commitment to delivering better for customers, supporting employees and contributing positively to communities. Such innovations are a testament to Amazon’s ability to adapt and grow, even in the face of global economic challenges like the Great Recession of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic​.\n\nThe company's culture remains a critical element in Amazon’s trajectory, offering valuable insights and lessons for businesses and individuals alike.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best innovative stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our introduction to what innovation is all about and why it's the most rewarded trait on the stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nInnovation is at the heart of human progress and share price growth. Firms that find unique solutions to business problems or customer needs end up improving their operational efficiency and creating new revenue streams. This leads to more return per dollar for a shareholder than would have been possible through other investment vehicles, in a self sustaining system that requires adept managers to dot all the i's.\n\nWhen we look at some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), one fact is clear. All of these companies created new manufacturing technology, platforms, products, and tools that were not present at scale in their industries.\n\nApple's example is worth a look here. Over the past decade, Apple's revenue has grown by 124%, providing its dividend shareholders with excellent value for their capital that is re-invested in the company through retained earnings. Apple had bled $1.8 billion in net losses during its fiscal years ending in the September of 1996 and 1997. Now, it's the world's most profitable non-state-owned company that generated $96.9 billion in profit during its previous fiscal year. Apple's success in the business world is attributed to its unique product design and the uncanny ability of its founder Steve Jobs to figure out key customer pain points before rival firms could catch on. The ability to design the right product and market it blends with the firm's complex supply chain that covers 50 countries and saw more than eight hundred independent assessments in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while Apple's shares and revenue are right at the top of the global food chain when it comes to innovation leading to triple digit growth, it is Tesla that is dominating the innovation space right now. The firm's revenue has grown by 826% on an absolute basis since 2010, since the market that it caters to is simply too big for Tesla to ever capture. Millions of cars roam the roads every day, and while it's easy to get an internal combustion (IC) car for low prices, a Tesla often costs tens of thousands of dollars. The lower cost market is a key Tesla objective, and its triple digit revenue growth is explained by the firm's innovation in manufacturing and mass producing a fundamentally different product in the market.\n\nWhile most companies on our list so far are mega-cap stocks, the one firm that isn't is Intel. Intel is the world's biggest processor company that designs and manufactures its own chips. This has been the case for quite some time now, and despite multiple slippages over the past decade, Intel still dominates simply due to its early found ability to double computing power every new processor generation. This ability enabled it to cement a market share right when computers were becoming powerful, and today, Intel is a corporate giant that controls the majority of x86 processor markets.\n\nLooking at these companies, it's clear that innovation is indispensable when aiming for success in the business world. Today, we'll look at which innovative companies are on hedge funds' radar and the notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 15 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now\n\nturtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best innovative stocks to buy, we ranked the top 30 holdings of the First Trust Innovation Leaders ETF (ILDR) by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of Q3 2023 end.

        "content": "Amazon is cutting several hundred positions across its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit.\n\nLast month Amazon said that Prime Video users would start seeing ads on movies and television shows starting on January 29, setting a date for an announcement it made back in September.\n\nPrime members who want to keep their movies and TV shows ad-free will have to pay an additional $2.99 per month.\n\nMike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, said in a note to employees that the company is boosting investment in areas with the most impact, while stepping back from others.\n\nAmazon has cut thousands of jobs after a hiring surge during the pandemic. In March, Amazon announced that it planned to lay off 9,000 employees. That was on top of the 18,000 employees the tech giant said that it would lay off in January 2023.\n\nJob cuts are occurring elsewhere in the company this week.\n\nTwitch, the video game streaming platform acquired by Amazon a decade ago for close to $1 billion, is laying off more than 500 employees as the company tries to turn the tremendously expensive division profitable.\n\nTwitch CEO Dan Clancy in an email to employees said that even with cost cuts and growing efficiency, the platform “is still meaningfully larger than it needs to be given the size of our business.”\n\n“For some time now the organization has been sized based upon where we optimistically expect our business to be in 3 or more years, not where we’re at today,” Clancy wrote.\n\nDeparting employees at Amazon Prime will receive a separation payment and other benefits like job placement support.\n\nIn May Amazon said that it would distribute its original films and TV shows, like “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” to media outlets outside its Prime Video service for the first time.\n\nThat content would be licensed via a new unit called Amazon MGM Studios Distribution, which expands the number of titles currently offered by Hollywood studio MGM. In 2022, the e-commerce-behemoth-turned-media-giant closed its acquisition of MGM — which houses more than 4,000 film titles and 17,000 TV episodes — for $8.5 billion.",

        "title": "China's DJI launches first delivery drone globally as regulatory shift spurs competition",
        "content": "DJI, the world’s largest drone maker, officially launched its first delivery drone in the US Wednesday, entering into an increasingly crowded market that already includes Amazon (AMZN) and South San Francisco startup Zipline.\n\nThe release of FlyCart 30 (FC30) marks the Chinese firm’s first foray into the delivery drone space outside of its home market. The company, which has over 70% of the market share in the drone market, is looking to differentiate itself by focusing on industrial use cases, including in construction sites and mountainous terrain, given its ability to carry a heavy payload and operate in extreme weather.\n\n“We are optimistic that FlyCart 30 will become a trusted solution for aerial delivery, solving complex terrain and terminal transportation problems efficiently, economically, and most importantly, safely from the air,” Christina Zhang, senior director of corporate strategy at DJI, said in a statement. DJI's delivery drone. (DJI)\n\nThe FlyCart 30 can carry a payload of 60 to 70 pounds within a 10-mile radius. It uses a coaxial four-axis, eight-blade multirotor configuration and can reach a maximum flight speed of 44 miles per hour. It will retail for $42,000, according to DJI.\n\nDJI’s launch comes amid heightened interest in drone deliveries, spurred by shifting regulations. While flights have largely been limited by an FAA rule that requires drone operators to fly aircraft within sight of human visual observers, the agency has offered some waivers in recent months, allowing companies to scale operations and expand their delivery zones.\n\nDJI has not received an exemption yet but said the FC30 had been built in anticipation of a change in that rule.\n\n“That’s partly why we’ve waited to enter this space,” Wayne Baker, director of stakeholder engagement for DJI, said. “We're hoping that this is going to be beyond visual line of sight operations capable. It's built to be that way through DeliveryHub, our software solution.”\n\nDJI faces other hurdles in expanding in the US. In December 2021, the US government put DJI on an investment blacklist, citing its involvement in the surveillance of Uyghurs in Xinjiang and its military ties. While the blacklist does not prevent US residents from buying or using DJI drones, it prohibits them from trading shares of DJI. The Shenzhen-based company is also unable to source parts from US companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, FC30 has been operating in China since August of last year, enabling the company to test key use cases. The aircraft has been used to carry photovoltaic panels to solar farms and pick up large loads of trash in remote areas, according to DJI. DJI's drone. (DJI)\n\nBaker said construction zones would be the most immediate focus for the company in the US, reducing reliance on construction crews to carry heavy equipment.\n\n“[The payload] can be brought up and down at the worksite to that roof area or even that floor area because FC30 has the ability to integrate a hoist, so it doesn’t even have to land,” he said. “We’re reducing the amount of time that a person would have to go up and down ... and time it takes for construction.”\n\nBaker added that the aircraft could also assist crews in natural disasters because of its ability to withstand extreme weather. It can operate in temperatures ranging from -4° to 122° F and withstand winds up to roughly 27 miles per hour.\n\nMeet DJI’s first delivery drone - FlyCart 30\r\n\r\nOvercome traditional transport challenges and start a new era of dynamic aerial delivery with large payload capacity, long operation range, high reliability, and intelligent features. \r\n\r\nDiscover more: https://t.co/Mp6MOVaapJpic.twitter.com/AZgHgLo9OA\n\n— DJI (@DJIGlobal) January 10, 2024\n\nCommercial drone deliveries have steadily expanded in the US, as retailers turn to aerial options to meet last-mile delivery demands. Globally, deliveries exceeded 1 million in 2023, according to McKinsey. But the focus has largely been on small packages until now.\n\nOn Tuesday, Walmart announced it would expand aerial delivery to 1.8 million households in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, in partnership with Alphabet’s (GOOG) Wing and Zipline.\n\nGlobally, the commercial drone market is expected to reach $38.2 billion in 2027.\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The first post-sales estimate has come from Mastercard SpendingPulse, which reported that holiday retail sales for the period of Nov 1 to Dec 24, increased 3.1% year over year, missing the previous estimate of 3.7%. Online retail sales were up by 6.3% year over year, lagging the prior estimate of 6.7%. In-store sales recorded a year-over-year increase of 2.2%, below the prior estimate of 2.9%.\n\nOn the other hand, the industry body — The National Retail Federation (NRF) — provided a rosy picture. However, these are estimates and not actual sales. NRF projected that U.S. holiday retail sales in 2023 will grow 3-4% year over year to $957.3-$966.6 billion.\n\nPositives of E-commerce\n\nInternet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it progress. On the one side are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other are sophisticated, AI-enabled software platforms facilitating transactions more capable of delivering user satisfaction.\n\nDifferentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc., as well as more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players.\n\nWithin the Retail sector, the Zacks-defined Internet-Commerce industry is currently in the top 28% of the Zacks Industry Rank.

        "title": "National Safety Council Releases Inaugural MSD Pledge Community Report on Workplace Injury Progress",
        "content": "Survey among more than 50 companies shows majority have strong safety cultures, more focus needed on musculoskeletal disorder risk reduction and innovation\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Musculoskeletal disorders, or MSDs, are the most common workplace injury, costing U.S. businesses in the private sector nearly $17 billion a year, according to the Liberty Mutual Workplace Safety Index. Recognizing the impact these injuries have on workers and businesses, the National Safety Council, with funding from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), established the groundbreaking MSD Solutions Lab in 2021 to solve workplace MSDs. As a hallmark initiative of the lab, the MSD Pledge was launched in June 2022 and many of the world's leading employers have joined the global effort to reduce this pervasive safety challenge. To help monitor progress along this journey of transforming workplace safety and improving the lives of millions of workers, NSC developed the MSD Solutions Index, an annual benchmarking survey, and today released the inaugural findings in the MSD Solutions Index Pledge Community Report. The National Safety Council is dedicated to eliminating the leading causes of preventable death and injury focusing our efforts on the workplace, roadway and impairment. (PRNewsfoto/National Safety Council)\n\nThe MSD Solutions Index provides MSD Pledge members with individualized feedback on areas of success and opportunity for improvement related to their current MSD reduction efforts and to help identify broader industry trends impacting MSD prevention efforts. Developed in partnership with academic and industry experts, the index is also intended to hold organizations accountable to their three main pledge commitments of advancing MSD risk reduction, innovation and collaboration, and safety culture.\n\n\"What gets measured gets managed, which is why collecting workplace data is critical to helping organizations mitigate MSDs,\" said Paul Vincent, executive vice president of workplace practice at NSC. \"Through the MSD Solutions Index, not only does it provide direct, tangible takeaways for each pledging organization, but it offers key insights that can be applied across industries to improve MSD prevention. Addressing the most common workplace injury on a global scale has never been done before and initiatives like this help our entire safety community be better positioned to create safer outcomes for millions of workers worldwide.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nStarting in December 2022 and concluding in June 2023, 52 MSD Pledge members – representing the manufacturing, professional, transportation and warehousing, healthcare, utilities, and several other industries – completed the 46-question MSD Solutions Index survey. Organizations received an overall index result, as well as results for the three pledge commitment subsections, that fell into one of five results categories representing MSD prevention maturity: novice, reactive, advancing, proactive and innovating. Major insights from the MSD Solutions Index included:\n\nNo organization earned a perfect score on the MSD Solutions Index, underscoring the complexity of MSDs and their prevention. However, 85% of organizations received overall results in the advancing (39%) or proactive (46%) categories, while 15% were in the reactive category. Further, 54% rated their workplace's ability to prevent MSDs as either very good or excellent. For the three subsections:\n\nRisk Reduction: 44% of organizations received a result of advancing. Safety Culture: Respondents showed slightly higher average scores, with 42% in the proactive category. Innovation and collaboration: Overall results demonstrated slightly lower average scores, with 31% scoring as reactive, though more than half of organizations exhibited advancing, proactive or innovating results. Larger organizations, which have more than 1,000 employees, are generally more effective at mitigating MSD risk, as they are more likely to have mature, long-standing safety programs and resources to adopt more complex MSD solutions and technology. In contrast, the majority of small to medium sized businesses established their safety program in the last five years. Eight in 10 pledge members have some form of MSD prevention or ergonomics program in place, and 65% have methods for tracking MSD rates across their workplace. Nearly two-thirds of organizations regularly conduct employee perception surveys, and nearly 90% have methods in place for workers to share suggestions for safety improvements. Notably, the MSD Solutions Index showed that when it comes to safety decisions related to workstation design, employees' physical work environment and workflow, frontline workers are regularly consulted on these issues, which leads to stronger safety cultures. However, while larger organizations are more likely to administer employee perception surveys, they saw lower levels of trust and frontline worker involvement in decision making. Nearly 85% of organizations reported that psychosocial risk factors contribute to MSDs in their workplace. These risk factors include things like mental health, fatigue, lack of tracking, and lack of personnel and proper equipment or tools. More than 80% of pledging members that completed the MSD Solutions Index are currently using technology in their workplace to prevent MSDs and just as many are effective at ensuring these best practices are broadcast widely across their organizations.\n\nWhile the report highlighted several areas of success among the MSD Pledge community – including tracking MSD indicators, involving frontline workers to make improvements, building greater workplace communication, and knowledge or use of MSD technology solutions – it also noted some areas of opportunity, such as improving methods of tracking MSDs, quantifying psychosocial risk factors, continually monitoring and assessing physical risk factors, sharing best practices outside of an organization, and understanding the workforce's unique needs. In addition, the report outlined several steps and actions organizations should take to achieve impactful MSD programs, including:\n\nEngaging senior leadership, designating an MSD solutions champion to represent the workforce, and creating and empowering an MSD solutions team to collaborate throughout an organization. Collecting and responding to employee feedback regularly and measuring the progress of an MSD program and safety culture, and tracking the impact, solutions effectiveness, return on investment and year-over-year change. Identifying risk factors with involvement from frontline workers and implementing appropriate changes. Ensuring MSD solutions are equitable for all employees.\n\nThe MSD Solutions Index is one of several initiatives led by NSC to achieve its goal of preventing MSDs before they start. Recently, the Council introduced the next evolution of its industry-first call-to-action to transform workplace safety, the MSD Pledge 2.0.

As a mission-based organization, we work to eliminate the leading causes of preventable death and injury, focusing our efforts on the workplace and roadways.

        "title": "5 Solid Retail Stocks to Buy on Robust Online Holiday Sales",
        "content": "Retail sales saw robust growth during the holiday season as inflation eased, giving consumers the confidence to spend freely. E-commerce once again played a major role in boosting overall retail sales.\n\nThe trend has been continuing for the past few years as consumers shopped online, lured by hefty discounts and buy now, pay later offers. The retail sector, too, is showing impressive signs of a recovery after taking a hit owing to multi-decade high inflation. Given this situation, investing in stocks with a strong online arm like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, GameStop Corp. GME, Target Corporation TGT, Casey’s General Stores, Inc. CASY and Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK looks like an ideal choice.\n\nHoliday Sales Grow on Solid Online Purchases\n\nAmericans spent $222.1 billion on shopping online between Nov 1 and Dec 31, up 4.9% year over year and beating expectations of $221.8 billion, according to a report from Adobe Analytics. Online retail sales grew 3.5% in 2022. Like every year, the biggest shopping days were Cyber Monday, Thanksgiving and Black Friday.\n\nHeavy discounts on a variety of items such as TVs, tablets and smart speakers to sporting goods and furniture lured consumers to spend more.\n\nAlso, buy now, pay later offers lured consumers to spend lavishly, which jumped a solid 14% year over year.\n\nE-commerce prices had dropped 5.3% year over year in December, which was another reason why consumers got a chance to make more purchases.\n\nCyber Week, which takes into account five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, accounted for $38 billion of overall online holiday sales.\n\nOverall retail sales were also impressive and came in higher than expectations. Total retail sales jumped 3.1% year over year during the holiday season, according to the initial Mastercard SpendingPulse.\n\nThe company also reported robust online sales. According to the Mastercard report, online sales surged 6.3% year over year compared to a meager 2.2% jump in in-store shopping.\n\nStory continues\n\nE-commerce has been driving retail sales for the past few years, which gained further momentum during the pandemic. The trend has since then continued. Also, consumers are a lot more confident about spending now, given that inflation has been declining sharply over the past few months.\n\nThis has finally raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon end its monetary tightening campaign. The Fed has also indicated multiple rate cuts this year, which will further boost consumers’ confidence as lower borrowing costs will allow them to spend more freely.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have chosen five retail stocks with a strong online arm.

        "content": "It's safe to say that artificial intelligence (AI) was one of the biggest investment themes of 2023. Technology stocks ripped to all-time highs with the Nasdaq Composite increasing 43% on the year.\n\nSome of the most prominent winners were the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a moniker that includes megacap tech companies Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Microsoft was the first in big tech to show its hand following a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT.\n\nThis undoubtedly sparked market-moving responses from competition, including Amazon. After the stock surged 80% in 2023, investors might be wondering if now is a good time to book some profits. Not so fast! Despite the Nasdaq's superb performance last year, there is evidence that 2024 could bring even further gains.\n\nLet's dig into what might be in store this year, and why Amazon looks primed to thrive.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes\n\nA brief understanding of the Nasdaq should help shine some light on why I believe 2024 could be another strong year for the tech-heavy index.\n\nSince its inception in 1971, the Nasdaq has only had a negative annual return 14 times. Moreover, the only times in its history the index experienced downturns in consecutive years were in 1973 and 1974, and from 2000 to 2002.\n\nGiven this data, it's clear that the Nasdaq tends to rebound following a down year. While this is encouraging on the surface, investors might be keen to learn about the magnitude of these bounce-backs.\n\nFollowing back-to-back declines in 1973 and 1974, the Nasdaq went on to return at least 25% in four of the next six years. Additionally, the Nasdaq has only dropped by 30% or more three times since 2002. In each of these cases, the index generated returns in excess of 40%. Taking it a step further, two out of these three periods were followed by further gains for at least another year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe last time the Nasdaq fell by at least 30% was 2022. This means 2024 is the second year following a downturn in excess of 30%, with 2023 returning over 40%. If the historical trends covered above continue, then investors should, in theory, expect another good year following last year's strong momentum.\n\nWhile investors should understand that past results are not indicative of future performance, I think there are many reasons to be bullish on the Nasdaq's prospects this year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI and cloud computing are a match made in heaven\n\nAlthough Amazon is mostly known for its global e-commerce business, the company is an undisputed leader in cloud computing. The table below illustrates the revenue and operating margin trends for the company's cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nCategory Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Revenue $19.7 billion $20.5 billion $21.4 billion $21.4 billion $22.1 billion $23.1 billion Growth (YOY) 33% 28% 20% 16% 12% 12% Operating margin 29% 26% 24% 24% 24% 30%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = year over year.\n\nOver the past year, AWS has been experiencing a declining rate of growth while margins have remained basically flat. While this might not exude the strongest picture, I wouldn't sour on Amazon just yet.\n\nLast year, the company invested $4 billion into an OpenAI competitor called Anthropic. The partnership revolves around AWS. More specifically, as part of the deal, Anthropic will be using AWS as its primary cloud provider. Moreover, the company also agreed to train future generative AI models using Amazon's homegrown inferencing semiconductor chips.\n\nWhy Amazon looks primed to thrive in 2024\n\nThe high-level implication of Amazon's investment in Anthropic is that it should help ignite some acceleration within AWS. One of the newer applications within the AWS ecosystem is Amazon's managed service offering, Bedrock.\n\nAnthropic could end up being a great source of lead generation for Bedrock, which offers customers a host of large language models (LLMs) that can be implemented for a variety of use cases. Bedrock is unique in that it allows users to test different types of LLMs and assess their AI capabilities. In turn, customers can make data-driven decisions as to which offerings within Bedrock best suit their needs.\n\nWith a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 2.7, the stock looks dirt cheap compared to its long-run average of 3.4. Moreover, this is significantly lower than that of Microsoft and Alphabet, which trade at P/S multiples of 12.6 and 5.9, respectively.\n\nIf 2023 was the year that AI made its way into the mainstream, I think 2024 could be the beginning of how these applications fit into IT budgets more broadly. For this reason, investors should get a preview of just how much capital will be allocated toward AI this year. And given the secular tailwinds in both cloud computing and AI, Amazon appears well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics.\n\nI wouldn't sleep on the company's prospects of generating more accelerated growth this year, and see now as a terrific opportunity to scoop up shares at a bargain.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "The 3 Best Fintech Stocks to Buy in January 2024",
        "content": "Financial technology can help transform an economy and it has emerged as a strong sector in 2023. The industry did face some volatility throughout the year, but with inflation easing, it looks like better days are ahead. Now is the time to look for growth stocks that have the potential to soar as the fintech sector grows. According to a McKinsey report, the revenue in the industry is expected to grow three times faster than in traditional banks between 2023 and 2028. This highlights the growing consumer preference towards fintech companies, which only strengthens their position in the competitive industry. Savvy investors know when to make the move, and now is the time to invest in the best fintech stocks.\n\nBest fintech stocks to buy: Visa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best fintech stocks of all time is Visa (NYSE:V), and this is one stock that will never disappoint. The fintech giant has a global presence, and has generated over 90% returns in the past five years. Visa caters to over 100 million merchants, and its market share is steadily growing. It is one company that continued to thrive even in a high inflation environment.\n\nAs the world moves towards digitization and the usage of cards increases, we will see Visa perform even better. Although the stock is trading at a 52-week high right now, exchanging hands for $262, it remains one of the best buys. I believe V stock will hit $300 this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company has a very successful business model which generates a significant amount of cash year- after-year. Visa processes a transaction when a card is used and it gets a cut from the transaction. It requires minimal cost to operate and this helps report impressive profit margins. Visa’s margin is the widest of any fintech company and it is only going to keep growing in the years to come.\n\nVisa uses this cash to reward shareholders has a dividend yield of 0.79% and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.52. The company saw a 15% rise in the net income to hit $17.3 billion in 2023, and if it can maintain the same growth rate, we could see it become the best in the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\n2023 was a year of high inflation, high-interest rates, and lower consumer spending, if the company can manage to report an impressive growth rate during this period, it can certainly do better in 2024. Do not wait for a dip in the stock because you could end up waiting forever.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrading at $8.53, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock is down 11% year-to-date and this drop is a solid buying opportunity. The stock looks cheap at the current level and it could double later in the year. Several catalysts are working for SoFi, and while many investors like to have a cautious approach, I believe this company could pay off in the long-term. The resumption of student loan payments will have an impact on the company, and it could see a higher demand for personal loans.\n\nThat said, the third quarter results showed an improvement in deposits and this is proof that consumers trust SoFi over other traditional banks. The deposits reached $15.7 billion at the end of the third quarter and it shows that the company will not have to rely on high funding sources for growth.\n\nSoFi did suffer more than it should have but it is getting stronger each quarter. The CEO expects to report a profit this quarter and we could see that take the stock higher. My InvestorPlace colleague Yiannis Zourmpanos believes SoFi is near the brink of a 300% jump over the next two years.\n\nThe company uses liquidity to invest in new products that enhance user experience and it has managed to hit $10.4 million in new products in the recent quarter. This has also led to user growth, and the company saw an addition of 717,000 new members which is an impressive 47% year-over-year rise.\n\nSOFI is trading at a huge discount right now and it may not be possible to get the stock at such a cheap rate.\n\nAffirm (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe one stock to buy before fourth-quarter earnings is Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM). The Buy Now, Pay Later company has gained massive popularity since the Black Friday Sales, and I believe it will report strong revenue numbers driven by the holiday season. Consumer spending is improving and this has led to higher revenue for companies like Affirm.\n\nThe biggest driving force for the company is its partnerships with some of the largest e-commerce companies including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and recently Walmart (NYSE:WMT). These partnerships continue to drive revenue. While Affirm is still unprofitable and it will take time to break even, there are chances of the stock moving upwards after strong quarterly results.\n\nDue to high inflation in 2023, the government had to resort to interest rate hikes, and this led to people spending down the amount they accumulated over the years. This led to higher debt and the massive popularity of payment options like BNPL. Consumers now like the option of buying something right away and then paying for it over a long tenure. While the company does face stiff competition in the industry, it continues to win because of its strong partnerships.\n\nTrading at $45 today, the stock has soared 380% over the past year, and while it might not be possible to repeat the rally, there is a strong chance to soar at least 50% this year. The last few months have been excellent for the company, and I believe the fourth quarter results will lead to a rally.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Want to Beat the Average Stock Market Return? Here Are 10 Stocks to Help",
        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index has delivered a gain of 67,036% (including dividends) since it was established in 1957. That translates to an average annual return of 10.2%, compounded.\n\nThat's more than twice the return investors could earn if they held cash right now, even with interest rates at a 15-year high.\n\nBut, historically, investors who purchased specific individual stocks have far outperformed the return of the S&P 500. I'm going to share 10 stocks that have crushed the index since their initial public offering (IPO), and they have the potential to help you beat the market going forward, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms: 826% return since IPO\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Its stock came public in 2012, and it has since gained 826%, which translates to a compound annual return of 22.4%. That's twice the long-run average of the S&P 500.\n\nBut it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Meta stock fell 76% from peak to trough between 2021 and 2022 and then roared back to life with a 194% gain in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), the company delivered a record amount of revenue, and its net income (profit) surged 163% year over year.\n\nMeta stock is still cheap relative to the broader technology sector, and more market-beating returns might be ahead this year and beyond as the company ramps up its investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks: 1,920% return since IPO\n\nThe next market-beating stock is Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW), a world-leading cybersecurity company that came public in 2012. Its stock has soared by 1,920% since then, or by a compound annual rate of 31.4%, and it spent much of 2023 making record highs.\n\nInvestors have rewarded the company's growing investments in futuristic AI-powered cybersecurity, which are already attracting significant amounts of revenue. Palo Alto's one-year-old Cortex XSIAM product is a security operations solution designed to reduce reliance on human-led, manual incident response with the help of AI. It has already amassed $1 billion in bookings, with one large organization using it to protect 300,000 computers and devices (endpoints).\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto is on track to deliver a record-high $8.2 billion in total revenue during the current fiscal year 2024 (ending July 31, 2024). Considering that the cost of cyberattacks continues to soar, investing in one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the world might be a great move for your money going forward.\n\n3. Alphabet (Google): 6,311% return since IPO\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, but it's also home to other famous tech subsidiaries like YouTube and self-driving vehicle developer Waymo. Google stock came public in 2004 (it changed its name to Alphabet in 2015), and it has since delivered a return of 6,311%. That's equivalent to a compound annual gain of 24.5%.\n\nAdvertising dollars generated from Google Search remain Alphabet's single largest source of revenue, but a notable contribution also comes from its cloud computing platform, Google Cloud. It's growing in importance because it's where the conglomerate monetizes many of its AI initiatives, from new data center chips to large language models that form the foundation of AI software applications.\n\nLike Meta, Alphabet stock also trades at an attractive valuation compared to its big-tech peers, and that could pave the way for more upside going forward.\n\n4. Netflix: 44,146% return since IPO\n\nNext up is streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). It came public in 2002, shortly after the dot-com tech bubble burst, and its stock has delivered a red-hot gain of 44,146% since then. That translates to an annual return of 33.7%, compounded.\n\nNetflix has disrupted everything from video rental stores to cable television. Its streaming service has become the largest in the world, with 247 million paying members, and the company continues to grow its addressable market by offering cheaper subscription tiers and by expanding into new territories.\n\nNetflix is the only stand-alone streaming provider generating a profit, which bodes well for its long-term staying power compared to its peers, many of which are slashing costs right now. That could lead to more market share for Netflix over time and more gains for its stock. Image source: Netflix.\n\n5. Apple: 181,080% return since IPO\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's first $3 trillion company, and its stock has been one of the best performers in the history of the market. It has delivered a gain of 181,080% since its IPO in 1980, or a compound annual return of 19%.\n\nThe iPhone smartphone has become the company's biggest value creator, leading to other billion-dollar hardware products like the Watch and AirPods. Apple also has a booming services segment led by the subscription-based Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV. But AI might be one of the biggest reasons to own the stock going forward.\n\nThe company's iPhone 15 Pro features an Apple-designed A17 Pro chip that can process AI workloads on-device. It's reportedly working on a large language model and AI chatbot, and the ability to run such applications on the smartphone (as opposed to in the cloud) could mark a new dawn in mobile computing and pave the way for new features. It's hard to go wrong owning this tried-and-true long-term performer.\n\n6. Amazon: 193,553% return since IPO\n\nIt started out selling books online in 1994, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has transformed into one of the most diversified technology companies in the world. It came public in 1997, and its stock has soared by 193,553% since. That's a compound annual return of 33.8%, tripling the long-run average annual return of the S&P 500.\n\nE-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, but the company draws most of its profit from its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is spearheading the company's AI initiatives, from developing data center chips to helping businesses develop their own AI applications. Amazon even purchased a $4 billion stake in leading AI start-up Anthropic late last year.\n\nBut there's even more to this company. Its streaming service -- Prime -- is second only to Netflix in memberships, and its digital advertising business is one of the fastest-growing pieces of the entire company. Simply put, Amazon stock is a great way for investors to expose their portfolios to the digital economy, and it's trading at a very attractive valuation. Image source: Amazon.\n\n7. Nvidia: 196,288% return since IPO\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the star of 2023, logging a bigger gain than any other stock in the S&P 500. It has a history of spectacular growth; it came public in 1999, and since then, its stock has surged 196,288%. That translates to a 37.2% annual return, compounded.\n\nNvidia's business is currently driven by astronomical demand for its AI data center chips, specifically the H100 and upcoming H200. The world's largest data center operators have raced to give their business customers access to enough computing power to handle AI workloads so they can develop applications and integrate productivity-boosting AI into their workflows. Nvidia has a dominant market share in this area, and there are very few viable alternatives right now.\n\nIn the recent fiscal year 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's data center revenue surged by a whopping 279% year over year, to $14.5 billion. The company's Q4 forecast suggests it will end the year with a record $58.8 billion in total revenue, and Wall Street predicts it could deliver $92.2 billion in fiscal 2025. In other words, there appears to be plenty of growth left in the tank.\n\n8. Oracle: 221,826% return since IPO\n\nFounded in 1977, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is one of America's oldest technology companies. It executed its IPO in 1986, and its stock has since recorded a gain of 221,826%, translating to a compound annual return of 23.1%.\n\nOracle started out developing database management software, but today it's a leading provider of cloud-based applications designed to boost productivity in dozens of industries. Investors are intently focused on the infrastructure segment of Oracle's cloud business because the company says its Nvidia GPU chip clusters can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of other leading cloud providers.\n\nOracle has already signed up leading AI start-ups like Cohere and Elon Musk's xAI, and the company is now building 100 new data centers (on top of its existing 66) because it can't keep up with demand. Therefore, now could be a great time to buy Oracle stock ahead of what could be a growth surge in the coming years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n9. Microsoft: 504,247% return since IPO\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is nipping at Apple's heels for the title of world's most valuable company. It has a market cap of $2.7 trillion, so it isn't far away. However, Microsoft has delivered a much larger gain than Apple since its IPO in 1986 (it came public with a much smaller valuation). Microsoft stock has soared 504,247% to date, or by 25.9% compounded annually.\n\nMicrosoft still operates some of its flagship software products, like the Windows operating system and Word. But it also expanded into hardware (computers and devices), gaming, cloud computing, and AI. Last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in leading AI start-up OpenAI, which developed the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models into its Azure cloud platform, Bing search engine, 365 document suite, and Edge internet browser, among other products. It's allowing the company to successfully monetize AI already, with 18,000 businesses signed up to its Azure OpenAI Service cloud segment and tens of thousands of organizations using its AI Copilot tool for 365 in the early access program.\n\nThose AI integrations could drive the next leg of Microsoft's growth, and with its stock near an all-time high, investors certainly appear optimistic.\n\n10. Berkshire Hathaway: 3,787,464% return since IPO\n\nFinally, the stock on this list that has created the most value is Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). It's an investment company led by none other than Warren Buffett, who steered it to a 3,787,464% increase in value between 1965 (when he took the helm) and 2022.\n\nThat is a compound annual return of 19.8%, and while it's a lesser yearly gain than some other stocks I've mentioned, Berkshire's ability to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 on a consistent basis for 58 years shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nBerkshire owns a $358 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, with large positions in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. It also wholly owns private companies like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Its diverse exposure to so many different industries has been the secret sauce to its consistent returns over such a long period of time.\n\nIf you're looking for a stock with a solid track record of crushing the S&P 500, then look no further.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s livestreaming site Twitch is poised to cut 35% of its staff, or about 500 workers, according to people familiar with the plans, the latest in a series of job reductions there.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSEC X Account Compromised to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETFs Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan BlackRock Cuts 3% of Global Workforce, Citing Dramatic Industry Shifts Xi, Biden and the $10 Trillion Cost of War Over Taiwan\n\nThe cuts, which could be announced as soon as Wednesday, come amid concerns over losses at Twitch and after several top executives left the company in the span of a few months. A Twitch spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nRunning a large-scale website supporting 1.8 billion hours of live video content a month is enormously expensive, despite Twitch’s reliance on Amazon’s infrastructure, company executives have said. In December, Twitch Chief Executive Officer Dan Clancy said the company would cease operations in South Korea, where the costs are “prohibitively expensive,” according to a blog post he wrote.\n\nTwitch has increased its focus on advertising in recent years. Nine years after Amazon’s acquisition of the company, the business remains unprofitable, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.\n\nIn the final months of 2023, several top executives announced their departures, including Twitch’s chief product officer, chief customer officer and chief content officer. Twitch also lost its chief revenue officer, who worked on Twitch from within Amazon’s Ads unit.\n\n“It’s always bittersweet when talented leaders move on to pursue new opportunities,’’ a Twitch spokesperson said at the time. “We are incredibly grateful for their contributions to Twitch and our community, and wish them all the best.”\n\nThe former employees all declined to comment.\n\nSince he took the position in March 2023, Clancy has been on a cross-country charm offensive to mend relations with the gaming celebrities who make a living streaming on Twitch. Many of them chafed at Twitch’s original approach to ads, which the company reworked after criticism. Streamers have praised Clancy’s desire to listen to their concerns after years of complaints that the service was out of touch with its users.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new chief has struggled to stem losses, however. Twitch undertook two rounds of layoffs last year, cutting over 400 positions, part of wider job reductions at Amazon.\n\nThe online retail giant initiated its biggest-ever corporate job cuts in 2022, which it expanded to 27,000 positions across the company.

        "content": "As we begin 2024, it is hard to know if the past year was the beginning of a revival for Hollywood stocks or the beginning of the end.\n\nThere was good news and bad news in the movie business in 2023. The good news: there was $9 billion in ticket sales, 21% higher than in 2022. The bad news is that ticket sales were $2 billion shy of pre-pandemic norms, Fortune reported on Dec. 31.\n\nThe tricky part for movie stocks in 2024 is that both the writers’ and actors’ strikes, which ended in late 2023, have caused production delays that will push 2024 top releases into 2025, reducing the drawing potential at the box office.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIs now the time to bet on Hollywood? Maybe. Maybe not. Here are three safe bets to play movie stocks in 2024.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe safest bet of all the Hollywood stocks would be Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which owns MGM Studios, which it acquired for $8.6 billion (assumed $2.5 billion in debt) in March 2022. If you watch new films from MGM, you’ll see that under the roaring lion is the name Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nAmazon acquired MGM from a group of private equity firms. Barron’s reported at the time of the announcement in May 2021 that the studio had $1.5 billion in annual revenue. Amazon had $9.9 billion in net income in Q3 2023 alone.\n\nThe MGM business is a rounding error for Amazon. The only reason it bought it was for the movie studio’s film and television library, which boosted Amazon Studios.\n\nIf the movie business doesn’t continue to recover in 2024, Amazon’s overall business won’t even notice.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger has plenty of issues he’s currently dealing with, including a fight between several activist investors.\n\nValueAct Capital and Blackwells Capital are defending the company from another activist, Nelson Peltz, pushing the entertainment business “to cut costs, lay out a CEO succession plan, and revamp the group’s streaming operations,” Reuters reported on Jan. 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the headwinds Disney faces — diminishing returns from its linear TV channels such as ABC and FX, ongoing losses from its video streaming platforms, and debate about what to do with ESPN — it has many wonderful assets, including Walt Disney Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Studios.\n\nAll of these businesses are included in its Entertainment segment. In fiscal 2023, the segment generated $40.64 billion in revenue and $1.44 billion in operating income. In 2023, the studios planned to produce 40 titles for release on Disney+ and Hulu and in movie theaters.\n\nAs Iger said in November, it has four major goals in 2024: achieving a sustainable profit for streaming, continuing to build ESPN, improving the cost and profit structure of its studios, and accelerating the already impressive growth in its Experiences segment.\n\nSuppose you want to bet on the movies. In that case, the Experiences business provides plenty of cover — it generates 37% of Disney’s revenue and 70% of its operating income — until Iger figures out how to make money from movies for the long haul.\n\nEPR Properties (EPR) Single family homes. Real estate\n\nSource: tokar / Shutterstock\n\nEPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) is a Kansas City-based real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns entertainment properties, including 169 movie theaters in 36 states operated by 19 movie exhibitors. They generate approximately 39% of their annualized adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate (EBITDARE).\n\nMovie studios generally get 60% of box office proceeds, while the theaters get 40%. It’s from that 40% that exhibitors pay their rent.\n\nSo, the better the movies, the better the chance operators will have the funds to pay rent. This past year was good with some hits — Barbie and Oppenheimer come to mind — but fewer than in 2022.\n\nAccording to the Q3 2023 conference call, the company’s focus on the experiential economy sets it apart from other REITs. EPR had $6.7 billion in investments spread across 359 properties in the U.S. and Canada as of Sept. 30, 2023, with an occupancy rate of 99%.\n\nWith a monthly dividend of $0.2750, its annual rate of $3.30 yields a high of 6.8%.

        "content": "Technology continues to advance and offer businesses and consumers more possibilities. Cloud computing is one major development that has seen tremendous growth over the years. Many shareholders who initiated positions in cloud computing companies early on have seen their investments significantly outperform the S&P 500.\n\nCloud computing started to become mainstream in 2006 and continues to expand each year. The business model results in steady, recurring revenue since most companies cannot sufficiently function online if they pull the plug on cloud computing services. Cloud computing allows companies to become more productive and reduce the risk of cyber attacks.\n\nCloud computing has been a top-performing sector over the past few years. Investors may want to consider accumulating these cloud computing stocks as they march higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) got a head start among the big tech companies by releasing Amazon Web Services in 2006. While many people associate Amazon with its massive e-commerce store, the company has made great strides in cloud computing.\n\nAmazon Web Services reached $23.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023, a 12% year-over-year (YoY) gain. AWS revenue made up 16% of the corporation’s total revenue. Amazon as a whole reported 13% YoY revenue growth.\n\nInvestors may want to hone in on the company’s expansion into advertising revenue. Amazon has quickly gained ground on this front and generated $12 billion in ad revenue during the third quarter. That marks a 26% YoY growth rate. Amazon has been running ads on its platform since 2012 and made it a separate category in its financials in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAmazon is well-diversified and delivered a 70% gain over the past year. The company trades at a 38-forward P/E ratio.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) allows companies to simplify workflows and reduce manual tasks. The platform is cost-effective for businesses and helps companies keep data secure. ServiceNow has achieved high revenue growth for several years, including 25% YoY growth in the third quarter. The firm exceeded guidance in the third quarter and raised 2023 subscription revenues and operating margin guidance.\n\nThe company netted 83 new transactions of over $1 million in annual recurring revenue. The number of transactions was up by 20% YoY. That indicates customers are willing to pay more money for the company’s platform. ServiceNow even has 49 customers who pay over $20 million per year for the ServiceNow platform.\n\nThe company continues to achieve these impressive growth rates while maintaining a 98% renewal rate. The high renewal rate is a combination of ServiceNow’s quality platform and how critical cloud computing has become for businesses. It’s often a pain to switch from any platform and many business owners get comfortable with what they use. This dynamic bodes well for ServiceNow investors.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc.

However, the company recognized this problem several years ago and diversified into other areas like cloud computing. The effort to diversify motivated the company’s decision to change its name from Google to Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet now makes most of its revenue from advertisements and cloud computing. Google Cloud made up more than 10% of the company’s revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Google Cloud revenue has been growing at a faster pace than ad revenue and could lead to more gains in the future. Alphabet closed out the quarter with 11% YoY revenue growth.\n\nThe company has a valuation above $1 trillion and is a staple in many mutual funds.

        "title": "IBM Is in the Midst of a Cloud Renaissance, Unlocking Secular Growth",
        "content": "International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) is in the midst of a secular revolution. The company headquartered in Armonk, New York, which is commonly called IBM, had a change in its chief executive officer in the middle of the pandemic lockdowns in April 2020, and the change in leadership seems to have paid off.\n\nThe technology giant, known for its dividend yield rather than capital appreciation, delivered 15.5% in 2023, outperforming the Dow Jones Index by almost two percentage points. Add in its juicy 4.1% annualized dividend yield, which brings total gains in 2023 to 19.6%, and there are compelling reasons to invest in the company.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with IBM.\n\nThrough my research, I illustrate how business fundamentals, cash flows and margins have started to look much better.\n\nThe sleeping giant has woken up\n\n2023 was a year that most economists and market strategists got wrong. According to Bloomberg, while some economists baked in too much pessimism in the economy, market strategists issued calls for 2023 to be bleak. As the economic slowdown narratives faded with blowout U.S. gross domestic product estimates consistently surprising on the upside, according to Fortune, markets eventually became optimistic and the S&P 500 index notched a 24.7% gain in 2023. The Dow Jones Index underperformed at 13%, but IBM recorded almost 20% gains this year, taking into account its 15.5% stock performance and the 4.1% annualized yield.\n\nWhile still impressive, many would view IBM as having underperformed the S&P 500 Index last year. However, when looking at larger historical performances and accounting for the severe volatility all investors were subject to in 2022, IBM has actually been outperforming the benchmark index. Its incredible performance is illustrated in the chart below. IBM Is in the Midst of a Cloud Renaissance, Unlocking Secular Growth\n\nThis feat is something that would not have been deemed possible given how severely IBM underperformed between 2012 and 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout IBM\n\nWhile IBM is a popular pick among investors, especially value-focused investors hunting for yield, I will not go too deep into the history of the company. But I will point out that it had trouble retaining its client base, especially in the last decade, as it missed out on the cloud computing era of software development and distribution. With the rise of cloud computing, IBM severely lost market share to cloud hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google.\n\nRealizing it missed out on the opportunity, IBM acquired Red Hat, the maker of open-source cloud software products meant for enterprises to build software applications in the cloud, in 2019. This acquisition became pivotal to the technology giant fully pivoting into its cloud business. Later, IBM's new CEO, Arvind Krishna, offered a glimpse of his vision in an open letter in late 2021, where he outlined the key strategies for his vision to take IBM forward. At the center of his vision was to revamp IBM's entire product portfolio around the hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence.\n\nToday, IBM calls itself a hybrid cloud company that helps enterprises build and scale AI, automation and hybrid-cloud-based solutions. As per its latest earnings report, the company makes most of its revenue from its Software and Consulting business verticals. While Software accounts for around 42% of sales, Consulting rakes in about 30% of the company's revenue. Since Software is the highest-margin business segment within IBM, I usually look for upward trends in this segment. Moreover, with Red Hat, Automation and AI part of the Hybrid Cloud subsegment, I want to see continued growth in the Software segment.\n\nIBM's cloud transformation is moving faster than anticipated\n\nThe most interesting part about IBM's reversal in business fortunes is that strength has started to return to its core Software segment. The Software segment is not only important to its overall growth narrative, but it also allows the company to leverage its position in the cloud computing space, which is still largely controlled by cloud hyperscalers. Within the Software segment, IBM's Hybrid Cloud business is critical. As can be seen in the chart below, this segment has started delivering consistent accretive growth to IBM's top and bottom lines. IBM Is in the Midst of a Cloud Renaissance, Unlocking Secular Growth\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Red Hat and Automation led the year-over-year growth in Hybrid Cloud's 8% growth, with Red Hat up 9% and the Automation segment up 14%. For a company that was expected to grow in the low single digits for a good part of the last two decades, near double-digit growth is quite a welcome change. Typically, its software business is 80% subscription-based, while the remaining 20% is consumption-based. IBM's chief financial officer, James J. Kavanaugh, recently discussed the strength of its Subscriptions software business:\n\n\"If I extract out that 20% portfolio of consumption-based services and just look at the core subscription-based businesses of Red Hat, OpenShift and Ansible, we grew 19% overall. 110%-plus NRR on that renewal rate of that business. And within that 19%, OpenShift and Ansible were north of 40%. So, putting all that together, Software is at the high end of our segment model; we're only building in high single digits growth.\"\n\nFinally, growth in the software segment is critical for IBM because this is a high-margin business, helping IBM book approximately 80% of revenue from this segment as gross profits. In a later section, I will unpack why this is important from a valuation standpoint.\n\nConsulting business turns up its contributions\n\nI previously mentioned IBM's Consulting business has started to scale its contributions to the top line in a very meaningful way. What is more interesting to me is that as I looked back over the past two years of available quarterly filings and compared IBM's Consulting business with its closest rival in the space, Accenture (NYSE:ACN), I noticed that IBM's Consulting business has been delivering steady and respectable contributions to its top line. Even better, the company appears to be gaining ground in market share versus Accenture, as can be seen in the chart below. IBM Is in the Midst of a Cloud Renaissance, Unlocking Secular Growth\n\nA peek under the hood reveals a clearer picture as to why IBM has been able to deliver such consistent gains even as enterprises around the world have been cutting their budgets for consulting projects. At the core of the Consulting business is the Application Operations and Management Consulting segment, which is directly tied to IBM's aspirations to scale capabilities for its clients in the hybrid cloud. As can be seen, Application Operations along with business transformation have formed the bedrock of IBM's consistency on a year-over-year basis in its consulting business. IBM Is in the Midst of a Cloud Renaissance, Unlocking Secular Growth\n\nOn the third-quarter earnings call with analysts, the CFO alluded to the strength in IBM's Consulting Business by adding that most of the growth was because it opened IBM's technology to strategic partnerships, particularly with the cloud hyperscalers. I believe this may have been one of the key reasons why IBM continued to reap benefits from greater cloud ecosystem velocity due to the partnerships. The continued growth in IBM's Consulting business gives me further hope that IBM will be able to achieve its target of 6% to 8% growth this year.\n\nValuations point to upside\n\nPer its most recent quarterly earnings, IBM's revenue was $14.8 billion, up 4.5% year over year. As I had talked about earlier in the post, the growth in earnings was driven by its Software segment and its Consulting business segment, which grew 7.8% and 5.6% year over year. While Software contributes 42% to IBM's top line, Consulting adds another 33%.\n\nI mentioned earlier that the performance of IBM's Software business is crucial to the overall growth of the company; not just because it focuses on the hybrid cloud, but also because this is a high-margin business segment with 79.5% of its software business revenue being recognized as gross profit. Software's gross margins saw a nice bump up by 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. In addition, IBM's Consulting business saw a meaningful increase in its gross margins by 1.4% to 27.4%, thus lifting its overall gross margins by 1.7% to 54.4%. The incremental gains in gross margins also helped increase the non-GAAP operating margin by 1.7% to 15.6%.\n\nIn terms of free cash flow, its free cash grew by $1 billion to $5.1 billion, aided by strong growth in its operating cash flow, up $3 billion to $9.5 billion.\n\nIBM projects its fiscal 2023 revenue will grow between 6% and 8%, while its non-GAAP earnings per sharewill decline by 5%. In fiscal 2024, consensus estimates project IBM to grow its revenue by 2.9%, with earnings per share rising by 4.4%. Assuming a 4.4% growth in earnings, this would mean IBM is trading at 17.8 times its forward earnings. Given the market estimates the S&P500 to trade at around 20 times its forward earnings, as per FactSet, this would give IBM at least 12% upside.\n\nRisks to positive outlook\n\nA major risk to IBM's positive outlook would be if enterprise spend were to suddenly fall, causing many enterprise clients to renegotiate their deals and push out their budget plans into subsequent periods. I use the word \"suddenly because, so far,enterprise IT spend is expected to grow 8% into 2024, per Gartner. This is a strong projection, and these forecasts actually bode well for the revenue outlook of IBM into 2024. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, if there is a recession or even a soft landing, as Bank of America predicts, IBM's management may be forced to re-evaluate their forecasts lower for 2024.\n\nA strong dollar could be another factor that could hurt the optimistic outlook for IBM. A majority of the company's consulting and software revenue comes from outside the U.S. If the dollar were to get stronger, it would dent the outlook for IBM to continue its growth into 2024. For example, one of the reasons that could push the dollar higher could be a reorientation by the Federal Reserve toward pushing interest rates higher.\n\nDespite these risks, I still believe IBM would provide even greater opportunities to initiate or add to positions were we to see any downturn in the stock.\n\nTakeaways\n\nWith the turnaround at IBM well underway, I believe this company has some great tailwinds that position the stock for upside. The accretive strength of its consulting and software businesses, with a renewed focus on hybrid cloud and AI technologies, has provided some opportunities for meaningful upside.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

Mag Seven led last year's rally, driving the tech-heavy NASDAQ higher by over 40% in 2023. And Jefferies is out with some more predictions to come for big tech names in 2024. Brent Thill, Jefferies senior analyst, joins us now for more on this.\n\nHey, Brent, great to see you and a happy new year to you here. Let's kick things off, first and foremost, with the perhaps permeation of some of that momentum that we had seen during 2023 for the Mag Seven into 2024. What are your expectations there?\n\nBRENT THILL: I think '24 is going to be a good year, but I don't think it's going to be as good as '23. We think the magnitude of upside for the large cap names won't be as great. It'll broaden and it'll go to more small and mid. As we see rates come lower, hopefully, the economy finds a softer landing. And that should be good for small and mid caps.\n\nAnd as such, our team upgraded Upwork or highlighting Pins. There's a number of other stories across technology that our tech group is focused on. So we don't believe it's going to be concentrated as much as we saw last year in the top names, but it'll broaden out. But we do think that the backdrop of demand looks solid for advertising for the other subsectors that we cover.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo we think that-- again, I think just the big change is the beginning of last year, no one really knew what was happening with rates going higher and ultimate-- and demand, everything kind of froze at the beginning of the year, and then unfroze as we went. This year, we go into a everything feels good, things are moving more normal year. And stocks have reflected a lot of that already.\n\nAnd so that's the only concern we have is the magnitude of some of these moves when you look at the move that Meta had, the move that numerous tech names have had is our only concern when things are kind of this easy, that's when you start to say, well, perhaps, there's going to be a pullback at some point. And we get an opportunity to get more-- to get more energized on that pullback.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Well, Brent, let's talk about your top predictions. You're at least starting with the large caps-- I know you're seeing opportunity elsewhere, but within the large cap space, you've been bullish on Amazon for quite some time. You think it still has legs to go higher here. What's the driving catalyst that you see for this stock, and why it's better positioned among some of the other players within the space?\n\nBRENT THILL: Yeah, last year, we predicted Meta as our top pick. And we're proud of that pick. That worked really well. This year-- every year, we switch it up. So you typically don't see the same name outperform in the next year. So Meta was last year, Amazon's our pick this year based on building momentum in AWS, their cloud business, the advertising business, as well as continued cost discipline in their core retail business.\n\nAnd Amazon stock works when they're in harvest mode not invest mode. And we think they're continuing to harvest the investments they put in the pandemic to get goods to you and I at a very rapid rate. So we are encouraged by the increasing margin structure. AWS will go from low teens to mid to high teen growth. The advertising business remains in a really good spot.\n\nSo we continue to like Amazon in the large cap side. We still like Meta, but just believe the magnitude of the run, based on what happened last year, a lot of that's already embedded in the fundamentals.",

        "content": "Fortune recently reported Capital Economics data that suggests property values for U.S. commercial real estate fell by $590 billion in 2023, will drop another $480 billion in 2024, and a further $120 billion in 2025, a three-year kick-to-the-head of commercial real estate stocks.\n\n“‘A lot of what’s going to drive next year is just continued maturities,’ or debt coming due at a time when refinancing isn’t so cheap, said Kevin Fagan, head of commercial real estate analysis at Moody’s Analytics. This year, Fagan said, banks and other lenders have offered a lot of  extensions and workout agreements to property owners, but that generosity won’t last forever,” Fortune contributor Alena Botros wrote in late December.\n\nAccording to Capital Economics chief deputy property economist Kiran Raichura, office properties may not recover until 2040, which is over a decade and a half.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat doesn’t paint a very enticing picture for investing in commercial real estate stocks. However, as Botros points out, the office market accounts for just 20% of the commercial real estate market.\n\nThere are places to put your money to make money in 2024. Here are three ways to do this.\n\nCoStar Group (CSGP) An image of a magnifying glass zooming in on the CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP) logo\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) specializes in information, data analytics, and online marketplaces for the commercial and residential property markets in the U.S., Canada, and several European countries. Founded in 1987, it has 75 offices in 15 countries.\n\nSome of its well-known brands include LoopNet, Apartments.com, Homes.com, BizBuySell.com, and several others. On Dec. 12, 2023, it completed its acquisition of the UK-based residential property portal, OnTheMarket plc, for £99 million ($126.1 million US). The move strengthens its position in the UK residential property market.\n\nIn Q3 2023, it reported $625 million in revenue, 12% higher than a year earlier, while its net income was $91 million, 25% higher year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSixteen analysts cover CSGP stock. Of those, 13 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy with a $95 target price, 15.3% higher than where it’s currently trading. It’s not cheap at 43.5x its estimated 2025 earnings per share of $1.89.\n\nIn early October, the company reported that Homes.com went over 100 million unique visitors in September, making it one of the two most heavily trafficked real estate portals in the U.S. All of the company’s U.S. real estate portals combined had 160 million unique visitors in September, more than Redfin.com and Realtor.com combined.\n\nThis is one example of how CoStar continues to grow.\n\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) Modern Medical Research Laboratory with Computer, Microscope, Glassware with Biochemicals on the Desk. Scientific Lab Biotechnology Development Center Full of High-Tech Equipment. Biomedical technology stocks, RSLS Stock\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities (NYSE:ARE) is a REIT founded in 1994. Its entire history has focused exclusively on owning, operating, and developing life science, agtech, and advanced technology mega campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2023, it had 75.1 million square feet of space either leasing (93.7% occupancy rate) or in development, with more than 800 tenants from the above industries.\n\nUnlike general office workers, working from home is hard for people in these industries. That makes its properties slightly less immune from the move to less office space.\n\nOn Jan. 4, the REIT celebrated its 30th year in business.\n\n“Thirty years ago, we saw the remarkable early potential of the life science industry, and today we are honored to be the trusted partner to leaders in this secularly growing industry who rely on our essential Labspace assets to advance and help safeguard their mission-critical work on truly groundbreaking therapies and cures,” stated Joel S. Marcus, Executive Chairman and founder of Alexandria.\n\nThe REIT’s annual dividend payment of $5.08 yields a reasonably attractive 3.9%. Of the 13 analysts that cover the REIT, 12 rate it Overweight or a Buy, with a $138.50 target price, 7% higher than where it currently trades.\n\nIts shares trade at 44.7x its 2024 EPS estimate of $2.90 and 34.2x its 2025 EPS estimate of $3.79.\n\nPrologis (PLD) The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPrologis (NYSE:PLD) is a logistics REIT. Founded in 1983, it manages nearly $200 billion in assets encompassing 1.2 billion square feet in 19 countries.\n\nIt has more than 6,700 business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment customers. Approximately two-thirds of its logistics space is in the U.S. Its top two customers are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD).\n\nOver the past five years, it’s grown core funds from operations (CFFO) and its dividend by 12% compounded annually, considerably higher than its logistic REIT peers and other blue-chip stocks.\n\nCoStar recently reported that logistics leasing in 2023 returned within 2% of the 10-year occupancy average before COVID. In the past year, businesses have leased nearly 33 million square feet of logistics and industrial space, according to Cushman & Wakefield (NYSE:CWK) data.\n\nIf Prologis’s Q3 2023 occupancy rate of 97.1% is any indication, the data from 2023 is spot on. That said, negative consumer sentiment remains, so it is building its landholdings to ensure it has plenty when the time is right to expand. It could be sooner than investors think.\n\nOf the 23 analysts covering its stock, 20 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a $142 target price. It trades at 35.1x its 2025 EPS estimate of $3.80. Its annual dividend payout of $3.48 yields 2.6%. Its stock is up 114% over the past five years, nearly 10x better than the iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF (BATS:ICF).\n\nIt’s an excellent long-term income and capital appreciation commercial real estate play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up by a considerable 15% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Amazon.com's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n\n11% = US$20b ÷ US$183b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.11 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Amazon.com's Earnings Growth And 11% ROE\n\nTo start with, Amazon.com's ROE looks acceptable. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 19% does temper our expectations. Further, Amazon.com's five year net income growth of 3.4% is on the lower side. Not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. Hence there might be some other aspects that are keeping growth in earnings low. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is facing competitive pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Amazon.com's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is AMZN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AMZN is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nIs Amazon.com Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nAmazon.com doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. However, this doesn't explain the low earnings growth the company has seen. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that Amazon.com has some positive attributes. However, while the company does have a decent ROE and a high profit retention, its earnings growth number is quite disappointing. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. introduced a new feature that mimics Apple Inc.’s AirPlay while working across different platforms, setting the stage for iPhone and Android users to wirelessly stream video to its TV hardware.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSEC’s X Account Hacked to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETF Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff Bottled Water Contains More Plastic Particles Than Previously Thought US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\n\nThe feature, called Matter Casting, is part of a push by Amazon to create interoperable services — an alternative to the propriety technology developed by Apple and Google. It will make it easier for iOS and Android phones to send video to Amazon devices, such as its Fire TV boxes and sticks, as well as the Echo Show 15 smart display.\n\nFor years, Apple’s AirPlay and Google’s Cast have offered this capability, letting users enjoy video from their phones on a large TV screen. But those systems don’t always work smoothly across platforms. Amazon also was at a disadvantage because it doesn’t have its own smartphone.\n\nThe new system — unveiled Tuesday at the CES conference in Las Vegas — will initially just send content from Amazon’s Prime Video app to Echo Show devices. Matter Casting will begin supporting Fire TV technology within “months,” the company said.\n\nBy later this year, the feature will work with a range of other video services, including Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, Starz and ZDF, Amazon said.\n\nApple and Google weren’t part of the Matter Casting announcement, but the three technology giants worked together on supporting the Matter standard for smart home appliances. That system allows an Apple user to, say, tap into smart home hardware designed for Amazon’s ecosystem.\n\nThe hope is to do the same for TV technology. Though Amazon previously allowed streaming from its video app to its hardware, it didn’t use the Matter system.

        "title": "Forget Apple: 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks led the market in 2023, and many believe they will do it again in 2024. This cohort, headlined by the big tech stars, includes:\n\nApple Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Microsoft Nvidia Tesla\n\nApple is one of the most prominent companies within this group, especially with its consumer-facing products. It's also the world's largest company, valued at $2.87 trillion (compared to Microsoft's $2.75 trillion).\n\nHowever, I don't think it's worth the investment right now, especially when this group has three better stocks to choose from.\n\nWhy is Apple a poor investment now?\n\nYears ago, Apple's stock was reasonably valued. Now, it's not. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nApple's stock trades for around 30 times earnings -- a level reserved for perfectly executing companies growing at an above-market pace. While it's hard to dispute Apple's execution, its revenue shrank every quarter in 2023.\n\nAs a result, Apple has a long way to go to earn its valuation. However, three stocks within the Magnificent Seven are cheaper and growing faster than Apple, making them superior investments for 2024.\n\nThese investments are better and cheaper than Apple stock\n\nOf the remaining six, I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms make for stronger buys.\n\nWhile Alphabet and Meta have other investments and businesses, they are primarily advertising businesses. In late 2022 and early 2023, this industry struggled. However, in Q3, they lapped those comparisons, which allowed their ad divisions to grow much faster than in previous quarters (Meta's ad revenue grew 24% to $33.6 billion, and Alphabet's rose 9.4% to $59.6 billion).\n\nThe same tailwinds that boosted these two in Q3 will prevail throughout Q4 and 2024, setting them up for a strong year.\n\nAmazon also has an ad division, but it didn't experience the same weakness as the other two because its ad segment is relatively new (at least compared to Meta and Alphabet). However, the rise of ads and other high-margin segments marks the transition of Amazon from solely an e-commerce business to one with vital services. As a result, Amazon's gross margins have substantially risen over the past decade with AWS (its cloud computing division), ad services, subscriptions, and third-party seller services.\n\nStory continues AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHigh gross margins allow for better profit margins, which have also risen alongside its gross margin. This paints an optimal picture for Amazon, as it is finally turning the corner to become a consistently profitable business.\n\nThis is something investors haven't experienced before, making 2024 an exciting year for Amazon.\n\nWith these three, there is a lot of excitement and buzz about what 2024 could be. With Apple, the consensus is: \"I hope the iPhone weakness doesn't get worse.\" I prefer to invest in more optimistic companies, making these three no-brainers compared to Apple.\n\nThey're also priced a lot more competitively. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFrom a forward-looking perspective, Meta and Alphabet are far cheaper than Apple. Historically, these two have traded around the same range as Apple, which means their stocks are slated for strong growth in 2024.\n\nAmazon is much harder to compare because it's in an entirely different business and hasn't had a full year of optimized profits. However, if you consider analyst revenue estimates for Amazon's 2024 fiscal year, and if the company can pull off an 8.5% profit margin for the entire year, it will produce nearly $50 billion in profits. With Amazon's current market cap, that would price the stock at 31 times 2024 earnings, which is still more expensive than Apple's valuation.\n\nHowever, that's a short-term view, as Amazon is just starting its optimization journey. As a result, I still think Amazon will outperform Apple by a wide margin over the next few years and could increase its profit margin even more.\n\nApple may have been the stock to own over the past decade, but there are much better options now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Walgreens Stock (NASDAQ:WBA): Dividend Slashed after 47 Years. Blessing in Disguise?",
        "content": "Last week, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) shocked the dividend investor community by announcing a 48% cut in its quarterly dividend, ending 47 years of consecutive annual increases. Despite its reputation as a dependable dividend growth pick, the move has eroded trust among the company’s income-oriented shareholder base. Nonetheless, I believe that management’s shifting focus toward balance sheet improvement should drive gains, moving forward. Thus, I’m now bullish on the stock.\n\nThe Dividend Cut: A Long Time Coming or a Suprise?\n\nThe reduction in Walgreens’ dividend has sent shockwaves through the community of income-focused investors. Going through the threads of various investing forums discussing the dividend cut clearly shows this panic. The shock comes not just from the stock’s legendary track record of increasing dividends but also because it’s part of the Dividend Aristocrats Index.\n\nThis elite index, housing 67 (66 after WBA is out) distinguished companies from the S&P 500 (SPX) with an impressive track record of elevating dividends for at least 25 consecutive years, is a testament to its constituents’ financial strength and stability. Thus, the repercussions of Walgreens’ dividend cut extend beyond individual investors, impacting ETFs linked to the Index, such as the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (BATS:NOBL), which must now recalibrate without Walgreens.\n\nSuch occurrences are exceedingly rare within the realm of Dividend Aristocrats, typically known for their sound capital allocation strategies and resilient, recession-resistant business models. Due to its pharmacies’ essential and recession-proof nature, Walgreens has historically demonstrated an ability to sustain dividend growth despite challenging economic downturns. Thus, management’s choice to reduce the dividend seems rather perplexing, especially since global economic uncertainty has eased lately.\n\nThat said, anybody who had bothered to take a look into Walgreens’ financials knew that a dividend cut was a long time coming. The persistent decline in the company’s gross and operating margins over the years, attributed to heightened competition and innovation in medicine delivery, coupled with the substantial debt on its balance sheet, served as apparent signs. A prime illustration of the industry’s shifting landscape is Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) entry into the pharmacy business.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeeing Beyond the Noise: The Dividend Cut Could Spell Upside\n\nWalgreens’ dividend cut has generated a lot of noise surrounding the stock and significant investor dissatisfaction. The stock experienced a sharp decline on the day of the news, compounding its existing downward trajectory throughout the past year.\n\nHowever, rather than perceiving the dividend cut as a negative development, I advocate for a more optimistic perspective. Viewing this event as a potential catalyst for positive change, investors may discover opportunities for upside potential. Specifically, a reduction in dividend outflows should now allow the company to improve its balance sheet significantly, which could, in turn, lead to bullish momentum, given the stock’s depressed valuation.\n\nTo better articulate the impact of the dividend cut, let’s delve into the context. At its previous quarterly dividend rate of $0.48, the company was paying out $415 million per quarter, translating to an annual outflow of $1.66 billion.\n\nThe company managed to cover the dividend until Fiscal 2022, when it generated $2.17 billion in free cash flow. However, the scenario took a downturn in Fiscal 2023 as free cash flow plummeted to $665 million, which was particularly unsettling, given the looming shadow of a $33.7 billion debt burden (including lease liabilities).\n\nWith its decisive 48% reduction in the dividend, the company is now positioned to not only meet its dividend obligations but also allocate funds towards bolstering its balance sheet. The revised annual dividends translated to an $863 million outflow. Simultaneously, consensus estimates for Fiscal 2024 point to an anticipated free cash flow of $1.15 billion, signaling enough cash generation to sustain both the adjusted shareholder returns and the debt reduction efforts.\n\nSo now, you have a stock trading at about 7x its forward earnings and at 1.1x its book value while offering a 4% dividend yield and paying down debt. This blend presents a much more compelling investment case than earlier, potentially prompting a reassessment by Wall Street. Such a reassessment could lead to a positive shift in valuation, paving the way for upside.\n\nIs WBA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nSentiment on Walgreens Boots Alliance stock varies notably among Wall Street analysts. The stock now features a Hold consensus rating based on two Buys, seven Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. Also, at $25.60, the average Walgreens stock price target implies 0.1% downside potential.\n\nIf you’re looking for a reliable analyst to guide your decisions on buying and selling WBA stock, Lisa Gill from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stands out as the most accurate over a one-year period. She features an average return of 26.36% per rating and an impressive 89% success rate.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, Walgreens’ unexpected dividend cut may have unsettled income-focused investors, especially considering its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. However, a simple look at the company’s financials reveals the necessity of this move, driven by declining margins and substantial debt.\n\nRather than viewing the cut as wholly negative, you may recognize it as a strategic decision to enhance its balance sheet. Trading at a seemingly attractive valuation while opening room for debt reduction, the stock now forms an interesting investment case with possible upside prospects.\n\nDisclosure",

As one of the top EV makers right now, Li is leading the race to the top.\n\nThe stock looks undervalued to me at $35 and it has the potential to hit $50 in 2024. The company has managed to thrive in uncertain market situations and it will continue to do so.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nThe biggest competitor of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Warren Buffet’s favorite EV company, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) has broken Tesla’s records. BYD Co. reported a record sales quarter with 526,409 deliveries while Tesla sold 484,000 cars. BYD Co. has been consistently growing its market share by offering cars priced lower than Tesla. It is also the second-largest battery maker in the world and is gradually expanding its global market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt sold three million battery-powered cars in 2023, which is its highest ever and a 62% rise over 2022. This means its profit has also exploded. BYD has resorted to price cuts to ensure steady sales growth and it has managed to manuver through the uncertain market conditions.\n\nAs the EV demand picks up, BYD could continue moving upwards. While Tesla lost its market share to other EV makers, BYD continued to expand to different countries. It is investing in production facilities and aims to increase production in 2024. It is building an assembly plant in Hungary and has also opened dealerships in Sweden, Norway, and Germany.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) is a hot fintech stock that can double your money. 2024 could be the year of SoFi as it eyes profitability and reports an impressive quarter. The company has seen a rise in deposits and could also see an increase in personal loans as student loan payment resumes.\n\nThat said, SoFi offers a one-stop solution to its users and this is how it continues to attract new users each quarter. In the third quarter, it added over 7 million users on the platform and it was the company’s tenth consecutive quarter of record revenue.\n\nThe company appears to be in line to report a profit in the coming quarter, and if it continues to grow the user base, it will become one of the top fintech disrupters in the country. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood has been loading up on SOFI stock and holds more than 1.7 million shares.\n\nSOFI is trading at $8.31, and this is one stock that will double in 2024. Buy it below $10 and take home big gains.\n\nBest stocks for 2024: Affirm (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuy now, pay later has gained immense popularity across the country and the record Black Friday sales showed that people like the flexibility of buying now and paying in regular intervals. This has brought Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) to the limelight, and the stock soared over 200% in the past six months.\n\nAFRM stock has gone from $16 in July to $43 today, and this upward momentum is set to continue in the coming months. I believe Affirm will report stellar fourth-quarter results driven by Black Friday sales and holiday shopping, and this will give a boost to the stock.\n\nThe company already has partnerships with several e-commerce providers and recently inked a partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT). This will help it reach a wider user base and see an increase in revenue. It is the key partnerships that have helped the company achieve new levels of growth.\n\nWhile the company is reporting losses and faces stiff competition in the market, it is set to benefit from an improvement in consumer spending over the next few months.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best stocks for 2024, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech dinosaur that will soar high in the year. The tech giant has invested heavily into artificial intelligence (AI) and this investment is expected to start paying off in the coming year.\n\nThe company generated $211.9 billion in revenue for the year, and it is only going to get bigger. It launched Microsoft 365 last year and it comes with a subscription cost of $30 per month. The company expects to generate significant revenue from the same.\n\nAdditionally, the company has managed to see explosive earnings in 2023 and is starting the new year on a high note. MSFT stock pays a modest dividend of 0.80% and the stock is trading at $370, close to its 52-week high of $384. The stock might look expensive right now but it will be hitting $400 very soon. This is one stock to own for explosive gains in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) became a pandemic darling in 2021, dropped in 2022, and then rebounded in 2023. This company offers everything you want to own including cars. It has a long history, a strong balance sheet, and a solid growth plan.\n\nAmazon has impressed investors with the steady upside momentum, and the recent quarter showed the success of Amazon advertising and Amazon Web Services. Its AWS revenue increased 12% in the recent quarter and it still has a lot of space to grow.\n\nI believe the company will be able to report better numbers in the coming quarterly results due to the holiday season and we could see a strong growth in the advertising revenue as the economy improves. Amazon has also invested in AI and integrated it into its services to ensure higher client satisfaction. Trading at $148 today, the stock is going to grow in 2024.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe hot stock of 2023 will continue to dominate the AI segment in 2024. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one stock that could continue moving higher in the years to come. It is still one of the best stocks to invest in for 2024. However, it will not be possible for the company to repeat the rally it enjoyed in 2023. Nvidia is one of the biggest players in the AI space, and it has already delivered over 500,000 of its H100 AI chips in the third quarter and saw a 200% rise in the revenue.\n\nNvidia has reported impressive revenue numbers in the last three quarters, and I expect the same in the coming year. It has already launched the H200 AI chip which can generate output twice as fast as H100.\n\nI believe the company delivers what it promises and this is why it is one of the best tech companies in the world right now. NVDA stock is up 245% in the year and is exchanging hands for $475 today. It is a hot stock with the potential to hit $550 in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable.\n\nTechnology stocks, especially the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, absolutely rocked in 2023 thanks to the AI-fueled rally. While the enthusiasm around AI is just getting started, many analysts believe in 2024 the broader market gains enjoyed by tech stocks last year will expand to other sectors while mega-cap tech stocks will take a back seat. Delano Saporu, Founder and CEO of New Street Advisors Group, while talking to CNBC earlier this month said that Magnificent Seven stocks are expected to take a breather in 2024 while market gains will broaden out to other sectors.\n\nRecently, Jim Cramer also talked about his forecasts for 2024 and said that there is a market rotation going on right now in which money managers are taking profits by selling major technology stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and investing this money into other sectors like financials, healthcare and small-cap companies which remained on the back burner in 2023.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, also thinks that Magnificent Seven stocks are not expected to always outperform and investors should look beyond these stocks in 2024. Discussing his portfolio performance on CNBC, Katz said over the past two years Magnificent Seven stocks on average are up just about 8%. He said that for 2024 he’s expecting the laggards of 2023 to “catch up.”\n\nIn this backdrop, it’s important to take a look at some of the top non-tech stocks that have been posting high revenue growth over the past few months and years. High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify profitable non-tech companies with about 20%+ quarter-over-quarter revenue growth recently and over 20% revenue growth over the past five years. From these companies we selected 17 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n17. Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 11\n\nCanadian banking company Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) is a stock with decent revenue growth over the past few years.\n\nIn November, Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) posted Q4 results. Revenue in the period jumped 8.9% year over year.\n\n16. HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nWith 38 hedge funds having stakes in it, Indian banking company HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB) ranks 16th  in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.\n\nRecently, UBS published its list of top global stock picks for 2024. HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB) made it to the list. UBS said lower rates and “resilient earnings” are expected to help global equities in 2024.\n\n15. Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nTexas-based Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) is one of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 39 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW). The most significant stakeholder of Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) during this period was Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management which owns an $82 million stake in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW).\n\nMany analysts believe small- and mid-cap stocks like TDW are headed for a rebound in 2024 while mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will take a breather.\n\nThird Avenue Small-Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Finally, long-time holding, offshore oil services company, Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) rose 31% in the quarter, as more investors and operators recognized the importance of investing in fossil fuels to sustain long-term economic growth and national security. In a challenging environment for most asset classes, Energy was a considerable outperformer this past quarter, illustrating the potency of the investor pivot.”\n\n14. Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nEntertainment company Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) shares have gained about 23% over the past six months. In December, Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) received several upgrades and bullish comments from Wall Street firms. Among the Wall Street firms bullish on the stock is Morgan Stanley, whose analyst Cameron Mansson-Perrone said the stock’s valuation is attractive. The analyst said Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) has lagged the market by 2,000 basis points since the end of 2021 despite return on capital improvements.\n\nA total of 40 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) as of the end of the September quarter.\n\nBaron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Liberty Media Corporation-Liberty Live is a tracking stock created on 8/4/2023 representing Liberty Media Corporation’s holdings in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”\n\n13. Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nInsurance company Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR) ranks 13th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors. In November Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $8.33, beating estimates by $2.21. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 42.6% year over year to $1.84 million, beating estimates by $40 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR).\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR), a provider of reinsurance and insurance products, surged ahead by 6%. Its second quarter numbers were solid across underwriting, property catastrophe premiums, investment income, and fee income. While there was an impact from severe storms during the quarter, RenRe’s losses were modest.”\n\n12. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nIn December, Goldman Sachs published a list of high-growth stocks that it believes have attractive valuations. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) made it to this list.\n\nA total of 41 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) as of the end of the September quarter. The most significant stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) is owned by D. E. Shaw’s D E Shaw which owns a $443 million stake.\n\nAriel Fund made the following comment about Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Several stocks in the portfolio had strong returns over the period. Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), was one of the top 3 performers in the S&P 500 during the quarter. Shares surged following a significant top- and bottom-line earnings beat, as stronger than anticipated consumer demand is driving a record WAVE season. Forward booking trends are also ahead of historical ranges at record pricing. These factors combined with further improvement in onboard spend and solid cost containment led management to increase RCL’s full-year 2023 guidance. We believe the revised revenue and earnings outlook lays the foundation for RCL to exceed its’ three-year strategic imperative, the Trifecta Program.”\n\n11. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nInsulin delivery systems company Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) 11th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.

Revenue in the period jumped 27% year over year to $432.7 million, beating estimates by $18.5 million.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”\n\n10. Lantheus Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LNTH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nHealthcare company Lantheus Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LNTH) ranks 10th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:LNTH) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also made an investment in Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNTH), which offers a portfolio of diagnostic health care products, primarily serving the complex nuclear imaging market. The company also has a pipeline of disruptive nuclear therapeutics (radiopharmaceuticals), creating a unique combination of strong profitability and cash flow generation with attractive growth opportunities in pipeline and existing products. The operational and logistical challenges of operating in nuclear medicine provide Lantheus a durable moat in this emerging therapeutic market.”\n\n9. Everest Group Ltd (NYSE:EG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nManagement consulting company Everest Group Ltd (NYSE:EG) was one of the stocks in the list of high-growth stocks trading at attractive valuations published by Goldman Sachs’ U.S. Weekly Kickstart in December.  Goldman Sachs said these stocks are suitable for those looking for high growth but are “wary” of valuations.\n\n8. First Citizens BancShares Inc (Delaware) Class A (NASDAQ:FCNCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nFirst Citizens BancShares Inc’s (Delaware) Class A (NASDAQ:FCNCA) revenue in the third quarter increased by a whopping 111% on a YoY basis.

(NASDAQ:FCNCA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s largest position is First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) (“First Citizens” or “FCNCA”). We acquired our stake over the past three years. Initially, we owned and traded around a small position in CIT Group Inc. (“CIT”) during the summer of 2020. We felt CIT was undervalued and management was making progress in reducing risk during the Covid-19 pandemic. In late 2020, CIT agreed to be acquired by First Citizens. We added to our CIT stake the morning of the acquisition announcement because we thought the acquisition was so financially attractive that First Citizens’ shares would rally and pull CIT’s shares higher. Our CIT shares were exchanged for First Citizens shares when the merger completed. We held onto our First Citizens shares because we admired the management team, we felt the bank was undervalued, and we projected the bank would benefit from higher interest rates. Then, earlier this year, First Citizens was the winning bidder in the FDIC’s auction of the failed Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). We added significantly to the Fund’s First Citizens position on the following Monday morning because the deal was unbelievably favorable for First Citizens.\n\nFirst Citizens’s stock price rose more than 50% that day and has risen another 40% in the months since the SVB acquisition. We have not sold any shares. We believe the stock still has the potential to double over the next three years. Despite this attractive upside, we think the downside is minimal. Our downside scenario is an unchanged stock price in three years…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

Gray’s Orbis Investment Management which owns a $705 million stake in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR).\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. Their company’s second quarter net interest income came in better than expected while revenues were slightly ahead. Earnings, however, fell short of sell-side projections due to a one-time legal reserve. The market looked past this blemish as its stock price gained 4%.”\n\n6. Heico Corp (NYSE:HEI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nAerospace and electronics company Heico Corp (NYSE:HEI) shares have gained about 10% over the past one year.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Amazon.com Inc. shares are poised to resume their gains after a rough start to 2024, putting the stock on track for a long-awaited return to record high levels posted more than two years ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Key Piece of Boeing 737 Found in Hunt for Clues on Blowout China Says It Caught Foreign Consultant Spying for UK’s MI6\n\nThat, at least, is the view among analysts, with some 97% of those tracked by Bloomberg recommending the cloud-computing and e-commerce giant’s shares. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are among firms naming it their top e-commerce or internet stock for 2024, while Oppenheimer and Roth MKM crowned it their favorite large-cap choice.\n\nIt’s the kind of bullish consensus that might raise alarm bells for some contrarians, especially after the shares surged 81% last year, the most since 2015. The stock was among the hardest hit of the big tech firms in last week’s declines, although it fared better than Apple Inc.\n\nConfidence is high in Amazon’s profit outlook, partly because of AI tailwinds. The average analyst price target suggests upside of roughly 25%, which would return Amazon close to its all-time closing high from July 2021. Among megacaps, only Nvidia Corp. boasts a better return potential, as the Street sees it.\n\n“I think this year you’ll get Amazon breaching its previous high,” said Andrew Slimmon, who holds the shares in portfolios he oversees at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “The stock is not expensive relative to its history, it is beating numbers, and consensus estimates are rising. That’s a recipe for a bull market.”\n\nAmazon has gone the longest among the so-called Magnificent Seven without posting a record, in contrast to Apple, Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia, all of which set new highs last year. The seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 Index by market value — a group that also includes Google parent Alphabet Inc., Tesla Inc. and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc., have mostly faltered in January, after driving the market’s strength last year. Amazon’s 3.3% drop is among the steepest of the group.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Magnificent Seven Loses Importance as Soft Landing Means Risk On\n\nAnalysts recommend Amazon for a slew of reasons, but most cite better growth trends and improving margins, especially as the company reaps the benefit from investments it made during the pandemic. Artificial intelligence is also expected to lift demand for its cloud business.\n\nConsensus expectations for Amazon’s net 2024 earnings have risen 18% over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, even as the view for revenue has held flat. Amazon’s most recent results, in October, showed robust growth in both earnings and sales, in particular its cloud business.\n\nValuation Appeal\n\nThe improving profit picture has helped boost Amazon’s appeal on a valuation basis. The stock trades at 32 times estimated earnings, and while that’s above the multiple of 23.9 for the Nasdaq 100 Index, it’s well below Amazon’s 10-year average of 57.\n\nNeedham & Co. touted valuation as a selling point. The firm named Amazon its second-favorite — after Alphabet — for 2024 among the former FAANG group of companies, which also include Meta, Apple and Netflix Inc.\n\nIts analysis “concludes that investors are getting AMZN’s core e-commerce business for free,” analyst Laura Martin wrote last month.\n\nAmazon is a perennial top pick for analysts. Goldman Sachs, Mizuho Securities, and Wells Fargo & Co. all named it as such at various points in 2023. While those bulls have been rewarded over the long-term, buy ratings don’t necessarily translate into superior performance: Amazon’s roughly 80% gain over the past five years compares with a 150% advance in the Nasdaq 100 for the same period.\n\nAndrew Huang, a portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management, is among those expecting improving margins and cloud demand to support the stock in 2024, while a low valuation relative to its history diminishes downside risk.\n\nHowever, he said, the near-unanimous bullishness could be a contrarian indicator.\n\n“If everyone is expecting another good year after last year’s rally, that could mean it is a time to trim your position, because the stock could take a hit on even a slight disappointment,” he said.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple shares have dropped about 6% to start the year, with a pair of analyst downgrades underlining concerns about the strength of the company’s key iPhone business. Both Piper Sandler and Barclays lowered their view on the stock, resulting in a consensus rating — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell views on the stock — of 4.04 out of five, the lowest for the stock since October 2020.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple’s iPhone sales slump in China is deepening and the company is likely to see volumes decline further this year, according to Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee. Elon Musk’s drug use has worried executives and board members at businesses he runs, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the billionaire and the companies. Samsung Electronics Co. likely managed to stem revenue and operating profit slides during the fourth quarter, affirming expectations that chip and electronics demand will gradually recover in 2024. Global technology giants including Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft are among firms working to ramp up their presence in Saudi Arabia amid pressure from the government, which has said it will stop giving contracts to companies without regional headquarters in the country. Meituan has become Hong Kong’s second-largest food delivery platform since debuting in the city last May, a sign that splashy subsidies are boosting the company’s first major foray outside mainland China.\n\n(Updates shares in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump’s?

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights General Electric, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet and Netflix",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 8, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Electric Co. GE, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Netflix Inc. NFLX.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nBest Investment Strategy: Buy on the Dip\n\nWall Street had a dream run in 2023 reversing the nightmare of 2022. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — were up 13.7%, 23.9% and 43.4%, respectively. In 2022, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 8.8%, 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively.\n\nHowever, market participants remain concerned about whether the U.S. stock market bull run will continue in 2024. The first three trading days of this year have witnessed significant volatility and a sharp decline in all three major stock indexes. Investors are uncertain as to when the first rate cut will materialize.\n\nBull Run to Continue in 2024\n\nThe impressive bull run is set to continue in 2024. The Fed's December FOMC meeting minutes clearly indicate a sizable percentage of cut in the benchmark interest rate this year. A rate hike is a remote possibility as the majority of FOMC members want to see the full effect of existing interest rate range of 5.25-5.5%. The inflation rate has been dwindling steadily since June 2022.\n\nA lower interest rate regime will boost economic growth speeding up investment by businesses. In 2022, small-cap companies suffered from record-high inflation, a soaring interest rate and fear of an impending recession. However, in 2023, this segment of the economy found some relief from these three concerns. The rate cut will further boost mid and small-sized enterprises.\n\nA lower interest rate regime will be beneficial high-growth sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. Several companies in these spaces depend on cheap source of credit as the full potential of their business is realized over a long period. A low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate thereby increasing the net present value of investment in these stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global supply-chain system has been restoring slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system's bypassing of China. Moreover, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain firm despite record high-inflation and interest rate. The latest report of the Atlanta Fed projected that the U.S. GDP would grow 2% in fourth-quarter 2023.\n\nFinally, a preliminary estimate revealed that a massive $1.4 trillion entered U.S. money market funds primarily due to an extremely high interest rate regime, with cash yielding around 5%. A systematic decline in the market interest rate will shift a major part of these gigantic funds to equity markets.\n\nBuy on the Dip\n\nMarket participants are surprised to see such an impressive bull run in 2023. Consequently, a large section of investors has already said that U.S. stock markets will remain muted in 2024 as valuation is stretched.\n\nAt this stage, investors should wait for a proper time to enter the market. The long-term trend of Wall Street is very much bullish. However, markets are likely to fluctuate in the short-term due to profit booking on stretched valuation or unforeseen external disturbances like geopolitical conflicts or erratic behavior of energy prices.\n\nIn this regard, every dip will be a good buying opportunity even for those stocks that have skyrocketed in 2023 and have strong potential for 2024 and beyond. Investors sometimes invest in overbought stocks due to the FOMO (fear of missing out) factor. Instead, they should apply a SIP (systematic investment plan) strategy.\n\nSelect bold stocks, especially stocks of those companies that are market leader in their respective sectors. Use every dip in these stock prices to form a formidable portfolio over a period of time. At the end of the year, this portfolio is likely to beat average market returns.\n\nHow to Pick the Right Stocks\n\nAt this stage, several stocks look attractive for future growth. However, selecting the following four criteria will make the task easy. First, select U.S. corporate bigwigs (market capital > $100 billion) that have a well-established business model and globally acclaimed brand recognition.\n\nSecond, look for stocks that have strong growth potential for 2024 and beyond. Third, select stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Fourth and most importantly, pick stocks that carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe five stocks that fulfill these criteria, despite stretched valuation, are:\n\nGeneral Electric Co. has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.6% and 69.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.2% over the last 60 days.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.4% and 13.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.7% and 34%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last 30 days.\n\nAlphabet Inc. has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 15.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nNetflix Inc. has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.9% and 32.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights CVS Health, Herbalife, Rite Aid and Amazon",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 8, 2024 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses like CVS Health CVS, Herbalife HLF, Rite Aid RADCQ and Amazon's AMZN.\n\nIndustry: Drug Stores\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2206233/3-retail-pharmacy-drugstore-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-headwinds\n\nThe three-year-long historic public health crisis significantly altered the structure and trend of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry. On a positive note, amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business witnessed high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care.\n\nParticularly, mail-order pharmacies registered growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring. With digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for industry stalwarts like CVS Health, Herbalife and Rite Aid, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\n\nHowever, the majority of the retail drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of inflation and labor shortages. Further, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. Added to this, with the end of the pandemic, demand for related retail health support has decreased, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players.\n\nLast but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there have been a number of new entries, which have increased the competitiveness of the space. Especially, a stalwart like Amazon's entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even in the current post-pandemic phase, pharmacy retailers experience growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Going by a Patch report during the pandemic, \"Two years ago, 11% of U.S. adult pharmacy customers got their prescription from an online pharmacy, based on a survey conducted by market research firm CivicScience, [.] That figure has been steadily rising over the years, according to Statista.com, an online statistics portal.\"\n\nA 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while in 2022, there was 76% customer reliance on digital platforms, the same shot up to 81% in 2023. The top digital channels cited by mail-order customers were pharmacy websites (59%), mobile apps (34%), and text messages (29%). Accordingly, the companies are strategically attempting to grow digitally.\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs, which hold wide profit margins, are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials.\n\nThe industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs. Meanwhile, to improve operating margins, pharmacy retailers have announced plans to reduce their footprint. In this line, in December 2023, CVS Health stated that it would change the way of pricing its prescription drugs with new pharmacy reimbursement.\n\nAmazon's Entry Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy's omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report dated Jan 5, 2023, Amazon's omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it to cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market.\n\nIn October 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. In 2021, a Business Insider report had come up with the speculation that there were discussions about Amazon setting up standalone stores in a few locations, including Boston and Phoenix. Per the report, which cited insider sources, Amazon was exploring plans to place the pharmacies inside Amazon-owned Whole Foods locations.\n\nFollowing its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market. With several other initiatives in the works, needless to say, Amazon's entry as a major pharmacy services player is a major blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #194, placing it in the bottom 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 16.7% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale Sector's rise of 20.1%. The S&P 500 composite has risen 21.6% over the said time frame.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.67X compared with the S&P 500's 20.34X and the sector's 22.70X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.86X, as low as 7.10X, and at the median of 9.21X.\n\n3 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus\n\nCVS Health is currently seeing greater engagement in an expanded set of digital health services such as antibody and PCR testing, vaccinations and omni-channel pharmacy. According to the company, CVS.com is one of the top health websites, with more than 2 billion visits in 2022, up nearly 55% over the prior year. CVS Health's digital capabilities for health interactions, such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services and sales of health and wellness products, have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues indicates a 9.9% rise from 2022. CVS Health, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, also has an impressive long-term historical earnings growth rate of 6.7%.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors. The company provides health and wellness products in North America, Mexico, South and Central America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, China and the rest of Asia Pacific. Herbalife provides products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports, and fitness, outer nutrition, and literature and promotion items.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a rise of 61% from the 2023 estimated figure. The long-term historical earnings growth rate is pegged at 5.7%. Herbalife carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nRite Aid is benefiting from the expansion of delivery services to its customers. Elixir, Rite Aid's pharmacy benefits and services company, consists of accredited mail and specialty pharmacies, prescription discount programs and an industry-leading adjudication platform to offer superior member experience and cost savings.\n\nElixir, Rite Aid's pharmacy benefits and services company, consists of accredited mail and specialty pharmacies, prescription discount programs and an industry leading adjudication platform to offer superior member experience and cost savings. Its wholly owned subsidiary Health Dialog provides healthcare coaching and disease management services via live online and phone health services.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings indicates a rise of 15.01% from the fiscal 2024 estimated figure. Rite Aid currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "Why I Sold Some Apple Stock to End 2023 and Where I'm Investing Instead",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks prized for growth and earnings stability, helped propel the overall stock market back toward all-time highs in 2023.\n\nApple's performance was rock solid despite higher interest rates and a resulting weakening of global consumer spending. When accounting for reinvested dividends, Apple stock's total return was an incredible 45% in 2023.\n\nThough I favor making small, gradual portfolio changes over time, I decided to sell some Apple stock near the end of 2023. Here's why and where I invested instead.\n\nThe most \"expensive\" magnificent seven stock?\n\nThrough thick and thin, I've owned Apple for many years. 2023 was an interesting year. Despite being part of the vaunted group of Magnificent Seven tech giants (thanks to the aforementioned stock price outperformance), it was actually far from a perfect year for Apple.\n\nThe iPhone remains far and away the flagship product, accounting for 52% of the company's $383 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended in September). But as I wrote in November, even iPhone sales fell slightly. Paired with a steep drop in the PC (primarily the MacBook for Apple) and other consumer electronics markets (e.g., iPad, Watch, AirPods, Beats), not even the ongoing growth in Services was enough to keep Apple revenue on the rise.\n\nApple was able to offset this weakness with ample share repurchases. It repurchased and retired $77.6 billion worth of stock, effectively reducing its share count by 3% last year and boosting earnings per share for shareholders.\n\nThat was a great strategy for investors during the bear market over the last couple of years, and my over-allocation to Apple helped keep my portfolio afloat. However, slow growth and stock buybacks may not be the best strategies if you believe (as I do) a new bull market might be in the early innings.\n\nApple stock looks expensive, given the sluggish earnings growth expected for 2024. In fact, of all the Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple has the lowest long-term earnings growth rate (9% expected), yet trades for a premium 28 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for next year's earnings.\n\nStory continues AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis is why I sold some Apple to redeploy the proceeds elsewhere. That said, I still have plenty of Apple stock. That now comes primarily via my old index fund investments in Vanguard Growth ETF (of which Apple is about 13% of the portfolio), Vanguard Information Technology ETF (22% of the portfolio), and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (nearly 50% of Berkshire's publicly traded stock holdings).\n\nNevertheless, with Apple maturing into a slower-growth business, and given that I have decades left before I need my investment dollars, I felt it necessary to trim and rebalance.\n\nWhere I'm investing my Apple winnings\n\nWhen looking for a replacement for my portfolio rebalance, I started with the Magnificent Seven themselves. I already purchased additional Alphabet last year. However, the other two parts of the big digital advertising market -- Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- still look attractively priced for an expected rally in earnings in 2024. I've been building up a larger position in Amazon as it figures out how better to monetize its massive e-commerce and digital consumer empire. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAfter an epic year for the buildout of generative AI infrastructure (mostly to Nvidia's gain), I think beaten-up software stocks could benefit in 2024 as all that newly installed AI hardware starts to get monetized. I added to a longtime position in Salesforce(NYSE: CRM) again and am looking to finally start buying ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW) sometime this year. Other cloud computing stocks look compelling for the new year as well.\n\nAnd, of course, I still like semiconductor stocks, too, especially if the iPhone and other consumer electronic sales notch a rebound in 2024.\n\nTo be clear, Apple looks like it has all the ingredients to continue as a great long-term investment. Growth may be more moderate than in times past, but the tech titan is highly profitable and doles out ample cash to shareholders. I'm happy to continue holding, but a high valuation compared to some other tech stocks makes me think there are better growth opportunities available right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Instacart will show advertisements on the high-tech shopping carts it sells to grocery stores, the latest addition to the company’s growing ads business and a sign of investment in products outside grocery delivery.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Boeing Slumps After Panel Blowout Leads to Partial 737 Grounding China Says It Caught Foreign Consultant Spying for UK’s MI6\n\nThe company will begin advertising on the carts, which include self-checkout and are equipped with cameras and sensors to detect items, at Good Food Holdings’ Bristol Farms stores in Southern California before expanding to additional stores in the coming months, Instacart said Monday. The smart shopping carts, called Caper Carts, are available at retailers including Kroger Co. and Wakefern Food Corp.’s ShopRite and Fairway Market.\n\nInstacart, trading as Maplebear Inc., has pitched investors on the strength of its high-margin ads business, which brought in a better-than-expected $222 million in revenue in its third-quarter results. Advertising accounts for about 30% of overall revenue, according to company filings. Growth in Instacart’s ads and enterprise businesses could help offset the macroeconomic pressures that have moderated growth in its primary online grocery delivery business.\n\nRead More: Instacart’s First Report Shows Online Grocery, Ads Strength\n\nBundling advertising with its smart carts will also allow Instacart to market its ads business to brands even as shoppers return to physical stores. More than two-thirds of grocery sales are expected to still occur at physical stores in the next few years, the company said in its most recent shareholder letter. Instacart expects brick-and-mortar purchases to be a mainstay for grocery sales.\n\n“With Caper Carts we are expanding into building technologies for the store because what we believe is customers are not going to shop just online or just in store,” Chief Executive Officer Fidji Simo said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Instacart will share revenue from advertising on the smart carts with retailers, Simo said.\n\nStory continues\n\nOnly a small number of carts have been rolled out. Instacart signed its first major retailer deals in 2023 and expects to scale this year, with the goal of having thousands of these carts deployed by the end of 2024, Simo said, adding that Instacart has seen interest for the carts from international retailers.\n\nThe carts show shoppers personalized recommendations during their grocery runs. For example, if someone has added cookies to their cart, they’ll see an ad for ice cream. Del Monte Foods, Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream, and General Mills Inc. are the first brand partners to advertise on the touch screens of the shopping carts, Instacart said.\n\nNew Shopping Technology\n\nInstacart made a major bet on shopping cart technology by buying New York-based Caper AI in 2021 for $350 million, its biggest acquisition to date. The carts are currently deployed at a handful of metro and suburban branches of US and Canadian grocers.\n\nSmart carts have slowly made their way to retailers across North America. Amazon.com Inc., which owns Whole Foods, has rolled out cashierless technology to some stores and developed self checkout Dash Carts for its Amazon Fresh markets. In May, Morton Williams ordered 100 smart carts from Tel Aviv-based A2Z Smart Technologies. The supermarket chain Wegmans is also testing smart carts after discontinuing its self-checkout app due to “too many losses” from shoplifting.\n\nIt still remains to be seen if retailers and customers will embrace smart shopping carts, in part due to the limited rollout and high price tag of the technology. Retailers continue to evaluate in-store experiences as the economy and a rise in retail theft, among other factors, influence shopping habits and staffing decisions.\n\n“Although there are other perceived benefits, like being able to track the total cost of the items in the cart or showing your shopping, these are of secondary importance to the customers and thus for retailers too,” said David Bishop, a partner at grocery research firm Brick Meets Click. “The ability to serve up digital ads is likely a secondary draw to the cart.”\n\nThe slow adoption rate of smart carts can also be “indicative that grocery shopping is a sensory experience and most customers are scanning the store and shelves as opposed to looking down at the cart,” Bishop said.\n\nAs competitors like Amazon and Walmart Inc. grow their online delivery businesses, Instacart is betting it can see success as a technical partner — rather than a competitor — to brick-and-mortar retailers. The company has said that customers who shop both online and in-store spend two to four times more than those who shop only in-store.\n\n“Our strategy is to enable retailers with all of the technology they need to run their business,” Simo told Bloomberg Television. “That’s why we have the vast majority of retailers already on our platform, well above any competitors.”\n\n--With assistance from Paayal Zaveri.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Can Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump’s?

        "content": "Let’s face it – not everyone wants to research individual stocks. That’s why index-tracking exchange traded funds can be so useful. Among the most popular ETFs is the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), which includes some of the best-known names in technology. Is QQQ stock right for you, though?\n\nIt probably deserves a place in your portfolio, even if you’re an experienced stock picker. The Invesco QQQ ETF, which is managed by Georgia-based fund manager Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), has something to offer to a broad variety of investors. So, let’s crack open this famous fund and see what’s inside.\n\nQQQ Stock: Cheap, Easy and Hard to Beat\n\nWhether you already picked out some technology stocks or not, you can get easy, immediate exposure to some of 2023’s biggest winners with QQQ stock. Furthermore, you can let Invesco’s fund managers do the heavy lifting for a very reasonable fee.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, the total annual expense ratio for the Invesco QQQ ETF is just 0.2%. Compared to the expense ratios of some other funds out there on the market, 0.2% is fairly cheap.\n\nJust to recap, QQQ stock tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. But here’s a fun fact: The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 actually has 101 holdings. Still, it does a good job of tracking (i.e., following) the Nasdaq 100 index, which is technology-sector-dominated and weighted by market capitalization.\n\nAnd by the way, passive income investors should be interested to know that the Invesco QQQ ETF has a 12-month distribution rate (dividend yield plus interest payments) of 0.62%. That’s in addition to the share-price appreciation, which was considerable in 2023. Impressively, the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 share price increased by around 54% last year.\n\nDon’t Fight the Fed! Just Buy the Invesco QQQ ETF.\n\nMoreover, QQQ stock includes some “Magnificent Seven” names that performed exceptionally well in 2023. Here are a few of them, along with their share-price increases from last year:\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA): Up 239% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META): Up 194% Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA): Up 102% Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): Up 81%\n\nThus, you were in the winner’s circle in 2023 if you just held the Invesco QQQ ETF all year long. This year’s best tech-sector performers might be different, but with Invesco’s diversified Nasdaq-100-tracking ETF, you don’t have to play the difficult game of picking and predicting.\n\nBesides, technology stocks tend to perform well when U.S. monetary policy is easing. That will likely occur in 2024, as the market expects the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates multiple times. This would reduce borrowing costs, and should provide a favorable growth environment for companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms.\n\nCatch the Wave of Momentum With QQQ Stock\n\nWhich famous technology stocks will be 2024’s biggest winners? Put away your crystal ball, as you don’t need to pick and predict if you own some QQQ stock.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll certainly want to have some well-known tech names in your portfolio when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. So, whether or not you’re a seasoned stock picker, keep some shares of the Invesco QQQ ETF for the rest of 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon launches health monitoring program, partners with Omada Health",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is partnering with Omada Health, a digital platform that aims to help users maintain chronic diseases, the two companies will announce later this morning, Yahoo Finance has learned.\n\nThe announcement, scheduled for 9:00 a.m. at the annual JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, signals the e-commerce giant's continued focus on getting a share of the more than $4 trillion healthcare industry.\n\nThrough the partnership, Amazon will identify potential Omada customers based on their Amazon purchases, however the partnership is limited to existing Omada customers who have benefits through their employer or other insurance plan. If a customer does not have access, Omada does not have a direct-to-consumer service plan.\n\nAmazon Health Services vice president Aaron Martin told Yahoo Finance that Amazon is hoping the program helps to lower overall healthcare ecosystem costs by helping patients better manage their health. Martin said that many Americans are unaware of the full scope of benefits offered by their employers, often leaving free services on the table that the employer has already paid for.\n\nOmada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy told Yahoo Finance the idea was hatched over a dinner the two long-time business friends had a year and a half ago. Duffy said that Omada's size at that point helped push the conversation beyond a pilot program.\n\nHere's how the program will work: If a customer is buying a bluetooth weighing scale, for example, or other equipment that could indicate medical needs, Amazon will push a widget through that asks the customer to check if they are eligible for health disease management services through Omada. Amazon announces partnership with Omada.\n\n\"What we're hoping to do in this is...do what Amazon's traditionally been very good at, which is make people aware, in this case of a product...or a service that doesn't actually even cost them anything more,\" Martin said.\n\nCustomers will enter their name, date of birth, company name and insurer in order to help Amazon ping Omada and see if the person is already receiving the benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy allowing Amazon to collect this data, customers can also opt for Amazon to save their details in the event they are not currently eligible but are in the future. And there is a way to remove the data.\n\n\"If a customer does not want to retain their information on Amazon, our customer service agents can assist with unenrolling their account,\" and all the data they provided to begin with, a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nOmada Health launched in 2011 as a chronic care virtual management system. It offers diabetes, heart health, muskuloskeletal, GLP-1 and obesity management services. It has been recognized by the CDC for its digital diabetes prevention program, and competed with Livongo for partnerships with insurers and other firms in diabetes management, until the latter was acquired by Teladoc in 2020. Omada has had a longstanding partnership with Cigna (CI), since 2015, which includes a $50 million funding round from Cigna in 2017.\n\nIt offers its services through Cigna's members, as well as employer, university and county benefits plans. Duffy said Omada currently works with 1,900 employers and has enrolled more than 1 million members — that comprises about 1 in 10 commercially insured adults in the U.S.\n\nThe partnership with Amazon is not exclusive, according to Martin. And Amazon intends to add more partners for its new program focused on other chronic health and disease management needs.\n\nMartin declined to reveal further details of the partnership, and what financial benefit, such as a referral fee, Amazon receives from the relationship.\n\nDuffy said there is no two-way street or cross promotion, and Omada has similar relationships with other retail vendors. But Amazon's scale is a huge differentiator.\n\n\"There's nothing else in the world like this,\" Duffy said. But he added if the experience works well for customers, being able to find out about a health benefit they didn't realize they had, it could result in greater use of Amazon's site.\n\nAmazon's Martin said the move capitalizes on the fact that many people \"use Amazon every day.\"\n\nWhen pushed for further clarity on who is gaining financially and how, neither provided details.\n\n\"There is an economic relationship that we're just not ready to disclose between us and Omada,\" Martin said.\n\nHe also declined to reveal what other disease areas or types of platforms could become part of the new program.\n\nBut the new partnership is in line with the messaging Amazon has been sending on healthcare: it cannot disrupt the industry solo and needs partners in order to succeed.\n\n\"I think the problem is that healthcare is a little bit cordoned off from the rest of our daily lives. And if we can kind of make it a little bit more pervasive, perhaps more people would engage with solutions and [it would] help make them healthier,\" Martin said.\n\nThe program has actually been live for a few weeks, Martin said, though he declined to provide further details about customer engagement levels.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "Even though the stock market is off to a rough open this year, there’s a lot of reason to be bullish about investing in 2024. The economy looks to improve, inflation is back to manageable levels and consumer discretionary stocks look to be a good sector for new investors.\n\nConsumer discretionary stocks are those that represent that provide non-essential goods and services. These companies do well when consumer confidence is high, and people are more likely to spend their disposable income.\n\nFortunately, the market has proven to be pretty resilient. Despite doom and gloom predictions that we were headed for a likely recession, consumer spending remained solid for most of 2023. propping up many consumer discretionary stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe jobless rate remained decently low, and the Federal Reserve seems to be on the verge of giving the economy a soft landing, something that seemed impossible a few short months ago.\n\nAmid this backdrop, I think it’s a good idea to be looking at some of the best consumer discretionary stocks. The names on this list all have “A” ratings in the Portfolio Grader because of their superior markets in stock performance, earnings, revenue growth, momentum and analyst sentiment.\n\nThere are no sure things in investing, but you can hedge your bets using tools like the Portfolio Grader. Here are seven names that rank highly in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logistics center in Szczecin, Poland.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat’s not to like about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)? Right now, nothing. But a few months ago, Amazon had its detractors.\n\nThe biggest thing that plagued Amazon a few months ago was its profits. CEO Andy Jassy took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021 and their styles have been quite different. Bezos focused on growth, Jassy prioritizes Amazon’s profitability. That’s a good thing, considering that profits had fallen near the end of the Bezos reign.\n\nAmazon’s profit and operation margins have grown steadily in the last few quarters. And while it’s best known as an e-commerce company, Amazon is also the leading cloud-computing company with its Amazon Web Services segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon recorded third-quarter sales of $143.1 billion, which was an increase of 13% from a year ago. And Q4 sales are expected to be even better, from $160 billion to $167 billion.\n\nAMZN stock is up 73% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nLi Auto (LI) A front view of the Li Xiang One SUV from Li Auto.\n\nSource: Carrie Fereday / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’m really high on Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) these days. The rapidly growing Chinese electric vehicle company has been on a tremendous run over the last year as its stock price jumped 78%.\n\nIn 2023 Li delivered over 600,000 vehicles, which is the most among China’s emerging new energy automakers. December deliveries set a monthly record for the company as Li topped the 50,000 mark.\n\nOverall, Li deliveries for the month were up 137%. And for the fourth quarter, the company’s total of 131,805 deliveries was an increase of 184% from a year ago.\n\nIt’s an impressive track record for an auto company that started producing vehicles in 2019.\n\nAs China’s economy continues to improve, I think Li will become a force to be reckoned with. LI stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. (COST)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ:COST) is a warehouse-style retailer that operates with a membership format. Customers pay $60 per year to shop at Costco stores, which are known for bulk deals and their vast produce selection.\n\nThe company says it can keep prices low through volume purchasing and reduced employee handling in their no-frills warehouses, which offer everything from food to appliances, home goods and tires.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 ending November 26, 2023, included revenue of $57.8 billion, up from $54.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Income of $1.58 billion was up from $1.36 billion, and earnings per share of $3.58 improved from last year when EPS was $3.07.\n\nThe company is off to a great start for Q2, with December sales up nearly 10% from a year ago to reach $26.15 billion.\n\nCOST stock is up 42% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA) automobile dealership vending machine. Carvana is an online-only used car dealer.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUsed-car retailer Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) had a great turnaround story in 2023. The company’s stock was less than $6 per share at the beginning of 2023 and looked to be in serious trouble. But by the end of the year it was more than $45, showing a gain on the year of more than 800%.\n\nCarvana sells vehicles online via a computer or a mobile app. There are no negotiations – customers can shop the company’s entire inventory online, compare vehicles and set up their financing. It’s only after the deal is done do you actually get to see your car in person, when you pick it up at one of its “vending machine” locations or have the car delivered to you.\n\nJPMorgan upgraded CNVA stock last month, saying that its business model “had given it a multi-year head start in the online-only space of a fragmented used vehicle industry, allowing it to expand at a rapid pace, though this came at a cost that has now come to hurt during a sharp pull-back in industry volumes because of higher rates and higher prices.”\n\nThird-quarter earnings included revenue of $2.77 billion, down from $3.38 billion last year, but Carvana made a profit of $482 million compared to $359 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nThat’s because even though retail unit sales fell from 102,570 to 80,987 vehicles, the per-vehicle profit rose from $3,500 to $5,952.\n\nThat helps CVNA stock get an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has long been one of the most popular fast-casual food chains and one of the more popular restaurant stocks. Shares of the company are trading at more than $2,200, which makes me wonder what would happen if CMG ever split its shares.\n\nShares of the company rose by over 65% in 2023 and appear destined for greater heights. The company has over 3,300 restaurants in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France and Germany, with plans to open another 300 this year.\n\nEarnings for the third quarter were up 11% to $2.5 billion, with earnings per share rising from $9.20 a year ago to $11.32 per share.\n\nChipotle also saw comparable restaurant sales increase 5% in the quarter, and the company’s overall operating margin rose from 15.1% to 16%.\n\nCMG stock gets a well-deserved “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) is a digital music, podcast and video service that gives customers access to thousands of tunes and hundreds of artists.\n\nSpotify provides a free service where people can play music they want, as well as a monthly premium service that provides more features such as ad-free listening, the ability to download music and listen with friends in real time.\n\nSpotify currently has 574 million monthly average users – up 26% from a year ago. Of those, 226 million are premium users, providing Spotify with most of its revenue. In the third quarter, Spotify generated $2.91 billion from its Premium members, and only $447 million through advertising directed at its free users.\n\nThe trick will be for Spotify to continue to convert free users to premium members. As it does that, the profits will continue to rise.\n\nSPOT stock is up 130% over the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG)\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a sports wagering site that is growing fast as sports wagering and in-game betting continue to grow in popularity. Currently, 38 states in the U.S. allow sports betting, which means if you’re in one of those locations, you can make bets on the DraftKings app.\n\nDraftKings has had an impressive run, particularly when considering where it started. Remember, DraftKings didn’t go public until April 2020, right during the Covid-19 pandemic when sports leagues were completely shut down.\n\nHowever, it had solid growth over the last year, as the stock price rose 180% in 2023.\n\nThird-quarter revenue was $790 million, up a whopping 57% from a year ago as more states opened the doors to sports wagering. Monthly unique payers rose 40% to 2.3 million.\n\nDraftKings raised its full-year guidance from a range of $3.46 billion to $3.54 billion to a range of $3.67 billion to $3.72 billion.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Despite economic uncertainty, Wall Street delivered phenomenal returns to patient investors in 2023. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite rallied 24% and 43%, respectively, by the time the curtain closed.\n\nAlthough the rally became a bit more broad-based in the final two months of the year, the outperformance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is widely credited with lifting the broader market higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to what have consistently been the seven largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. by market cap:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nApple clocked in as the \"worst\" of the bunch with a 48% return in 2023, while Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia rallied 102%, 194%, and 239%, respectively. AAPL Chart\n\nWhat investors seem to appreciate about the Magnificent Seven stocks is their undeniable competitive advantages.\n\nApple's iPhone is responsible for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share, and its share repurchase program is unmatched by other public companies. Microsoft's Windows is still the undisputed leader in desktop operating systems, while Azure has gobbled up a 25% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Alphabet's Google accounted for close to 92% of worldwide internet search share in December. Meanwhile, streaming platform YouTube (also owned by Alphabet) attracts more than 2.7 billion unique viewers each month. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brings in an estimated 40% of U.S. online retail sales, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) leading the world in cloud infrastructure service spending share (31%), as of the third quarter. Nvidia is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nvidia may account for more than 90% of all graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers in 2024. Meta Platforms owns the world's top social media \"real estate.\" Facebook is the most-visited site globally, with WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger collectively (with Facebook) attracting close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's comfortably reached recurring profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn spite of these competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven stocks could differ dramatically in the new year. Whereas one Magnificent Seven stock is effectively cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company, another expensive highflier appears poised for a reality check.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in 2024: Amazon\n\nAmong the seven industry titans listed above, the one investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024, and likely hold for many years to come, is e-commerce company Amazon.\n\nThe biggest potential headwind for Amazon in the new year is the possibility of a U.S. recession taking shape. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggest a downturn is likely. Since Amazon generates so much of its revenue from its online marketplace, a recession would be expected to slow consumer spending.\n\nBut there are two important things to understand about this headwind for Amazon. First, recessions are historically short-lived. Only three of 12 U.S. recessions following World War II have surpassed 12 months, and none have made it past 18 months. Betting on economic expansion has always been a winning move for patient investors.\n\nSecondly, but most important, Amazon generates very little of its operating cash flow and operating income from its mammoth online marketplace. Even if online retail sales were to taper a bit, it would likely have a negligible impact on the company's cash flow and bottom line.\n\nWhat can carry Amazon's stock to new highs in 2024 is the company's high-growth ancillary operating segments, which are led by AWS.\n\nAs noted, AWS accounts for nearly a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending. Cloud service margins can run circles around the razor-thin margins associated with online retail sales. As a result, AWS is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income despite generating only a sixth of the company's net sales. With enterprise cloud-service spending still ramping up, AWS looks to have a long runway of double-digit growth ahead of it.\n\nDon't overlook Amazon's advertising services segment, either. This is a company that's drawing more than 2 billion people to its site on a monthly basis, many of which are motivated shoppers. This puts the ball in Amazon's court when it comes to ad-pricing power. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered at least 21% year-over-year constant-currency sales growth over the past eight quarters (two years).\n\nAlthough some fundamentally focused investors are going to be turned off by Amazon's astronomical trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 75, the traditional P/E ratio is a terrible way to value cutting-edge companies like Amazon that are reinvesting the bulk of their operating cash flow back into their business. Valuing Amazon relative to its cash flow is, therefore, a much smarter approach.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Amazon was regularly valued at a multiple of 23 to 37 times cash flow. It can be scooped up right now for less than 13 times forecast cash flow in 2024. With the exception of the 2022 bear market, it's the cheapest Amazon has traded, relative to its future cash flow, since going public in 1997. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Nvidia\n\nOn the other side of the coin, semiconductor giant Nvidia has all the hallmarks of a stock to avoid like the plague in 2024.\n\nI'll absolutely give Nvidia credit where credit is due for more than tripling in value last year. With interest in AI soaring, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs quickly became staples in AI-accelerated data centers. Considering that chip fabrication juggernaut Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is significantly beefing up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble delivering more of its AI-driven GPUs in the quarters to come.\n\nSo, what's the problem? Pricing power, growing competition, regulatory headwinds, and history all come to mind.\n\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ends later this month, the company's sales are expected to climb by approximately 119% from the previous year. Almost the entirety of this growth can be traced to the company's GPUs from its data-center segment. More specifically, it's being driven by jaw-dropping pricing power.\n\nThrough the first six months of fiscal 2024, Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined from the prior-year period. Through the first nine months, it's only jumped by an aggregate of 20%. What this tells investors is that A100 and H100 scarcity is what's driven Nvidia's sales growth. Ironically, ramping up its own production in the current calendar year is liable to sap its pricing power and adversely impact its gross margin.\n\nTo build on this point, competition in AI-focused GPUs is bound to pick up. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to roll it out in a big way throughout 2024. Likewise, Intel plans to bring its Falcon Shores GPU to market as a direct competitor to Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips in 2025. This should provide further downside pressure on Nvidia's pricing power.\n\nRegulators are doing Nvidia no favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have imposed restrictions on AI-GPU exports to China. This is a potentially big blow to Nvidia, which regularly generates between 20% and 25% of its sales from the world's No. 2 global economy by gross domestic product.\n\nLastly, history could be Nvidia's worst enemy in the new year. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years that's avoided an initial bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have a tendency to overestimate the adoption/uptake of new innovations without giving them the proper time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to the rule, which could sink Nvidia's proverbial ship in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Quantum computing is the next evolution of computing. Its benefit is that, at its core, it is capable of solving problems that classical computers cannot. Classical computers often rely on brute force to find solutions to complex problems. However, like all things, there is a barrier. These millionaire-maker quantum computing stocks will push computing past its current limits.\n\nFaster computing times have vast applications. Just about everything today relies on computers and, as the field develops, investment is sure to rise. That makes the quantum computing stocks below incredibly interesting. Compound annual growth rates in the sector are expected to reach above 38% between 2023 and 2028. Thus, an investment today could yield substantial returns for millionaire-maker quantum computing stocks.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock. Millionaire-maker quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) has developed the IonQ Forte quantum computer, while emerging as one of the sector’s top stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts shares have really blossomed in 2023, providing investors with strong returns – but not returns without volatility. The company’s shares were below $4 at the beginning of the year, but shot up to almost $20 in August. It currently resides at around $12. So, it was both rewarded and punished in 2023.\n\nThe company’s Forte quantum computers are currently available through the three leading Cloud providers; Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud.\n\nCompany revenues grew by 122% in the third quarter, reaching $6.1 million. While that was above the high end of guidance, Its 22 cent EPS was 7 cents lower than expected. Yet, the company increased its guidance for the full year to a high of $22 million from a previous high of $19.3 million.\n\nFormFactor (FORM) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) is an interesting, diversified way to play the emergence of quantum computing stocks. The company is not primarily engaged in the business of quantum computing. Instead, FormFactor is a semiconductor company.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company sells probe cards which are used for chip testing. Semiconductor testing and measurement is a growing, high-margin business worthy of investment.\n\nHowever, FormFactor also recently released a quantum computing chip which has thrust it into the conversation relating to quantum computing. Clearly, FormFactor is a more diverse and potentially lower-risk option in millionaire-maker quantum computing stocks.\n\nFinancially, the stock is somewhat of a mixed bag: Earnings were roughly 17% better than expected but revenues were roughly 4% lower than anticipated. The company shares are also relatively well established and trade for just over $37. Thus, they don’t have the same runaway growth potential as IonQ’s, for example. Nevertheless, they do have the potential to provide substantial returns in the future.\n\nQuantum Computing (QUBT) A concept image showing a quantum computer with a matrix background; quantum computing. leading quantum stocks, quantum computing stocks to buy. Millionaire-maker quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nQuantum Computing (NASDAQ:QUBT) is, in my opinion, the stock with the most potential to create millionaires. The company is very small and produced a mere $50,000 in revenues in the third quarter.\n\nThat revenue is largely attributable to the provision of professional services to both public and commercial firms. Although the company’s revenues continue to be small, there is a positive to take from its most recent earnings report: Revenues increased by 111% during the first nine months of 2023, reaching $283,000.\n\nQuantum Computing has released five products over the previous 17 months, completed its first hardware sale and begun to build out of its quantum chip facility. Although its revenues remain modest, the company is resolute that at some point its continued ability to progress will lead to large contracts.\n\nThe company has developed a particularly strong relationship with NASA, securing its third subcontract award from the agency in July. It’s clear that the government will continue to fund the development of the field. If Quantum Computing can provide results, the sky’s the limit.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its “ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy” fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. For both the quarter and the whole year, the Strategy exceeded the benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index, supported by robust Magnificent Seven stock selection, opportunistic management of earnings reset names, and diverse non-tech contributions. The Strategy posted gains across 10 out of the eleven sectors in which it was invested, on an absolute basis. Overall stock selection contributed to performance on a relative basis. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy featured stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $145.24 per share. One-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was -0.45%, and its shares gained 66.25% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a market capitalization of $1.501 trillion.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n\"Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Nvidia. Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments, most notably its core e-commerce business, while Meta saw accelerated revenue growth and share gains in online advertising.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Sunrise King on Unsplash\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "3 Berkshire Hathaway Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in January",
        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway is one of the world's premier investment conglomerates. Through strategic investments, subsidiary businesses operating in insurance and logistics, and a disciplined business approach, it has grown to a nearly $800 billion company.\n\nLed by Warren Buffett and his team, Berkshire Hathaway and its investments have influenced countless investors globally. Still, copying Berkshire's portfolio, stock for stock, may not be the best option because your goals and risk tolerance may not entirely align with it.\n\nHowever, for investors looking for Berkshire Hathaway stocks to load up on now, here are three that are well worth considering.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE: KO) has been a staple in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio since its first investment in 1988. Since then, Berkshire Hathaway has accumulated 400 million Coca-Cola shares, representing around 9% of the company's shares.\n\nIn the U.S., Coca-Cola had a 46% market share in the carbonated soft drink market at the end of 2022, far outpacing its biggest competitor, PepsiCo. Regardless of Coca-Cola's market dominance over the decades, I appreciate how it has yet to get complacent and continues prioritizing innovation and adapting to consumers' ever-changing preferences. A testament to this has been Coca-Cola's Transformational Innovation Team, whose sole purpose is driving product development and exploring new market trends.\n\nCoca-Cola's stock price has underperformed against the S&P 500 over the past decade, but its dividend is what generally attracts investors. Coca-Cola's quarterly dividend is $0.46, with a trailing 12-month yield of around 3%. Arguably more impressive is that it has increased its yearly dividend for 61 consecutive years, giving it the esteemed title of Dividend King. In the past 10 years alone, Coca-Cola's quarterly dividend has increased by over 50%. KO Dividend Chart\n\nCoca-Cola isn't a growth stock that'll consistently return double-digit percentages year in and year out, but it can provide investors with as reliable a dividend as you'll find on the stock market.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Visa\n\nVisa (NYSE: V) is the global leader in digital payments, with a vast, constantly expanding reach. It operates in over 200 countries, has over $4.3 billion cards in circulation, and is accepted by over 130 million merchant locations.\n\nVisa's reach is its key competitive advantage, mostly because of the network effect. Imagine you're a retailer and have to choose which cards you'll accept. Chances are high that you'll go with Visa because you understand your customers will likely have a Visa card over other options. Not accepting Visa cards could mean missing out on sales. The same applies to consumers looking to get a card. Many prefer a Visa card because businesses that accept cards are very likely to accept Visa.\n\nVisa's recent growth has translated well to its financials as well. Over the past decade, its revenue is up 172%, but its net income and free cash flow have grown faster, signaling the company is operating more efficiently. V Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe U.S. may be a leader in digital payments, but much of the world still operates in a cash economy. That gives Visa plenty of market opportunity as countries transition toward digital and electronic payments. It's a stock I feel comfortable holding onto for the long haul.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't a company that needs much of an introduction. Its e-commerce business has made it a household name around the globe. However, it likely won't be Amazon's e-commerce business that drives a lot of its growth in the foreseeable future -- it may be the logistics network that powers it.\n\nAmazon recently announced \"Supply Chain by Amazon,\" a fully automated set of supply chain services. The service allows sellers to take advantage of Amazon's complex logistics, warehousing, distribution, fulfillment capabilities, and transportation (including international).\n\nAmazon has spent billions building out its logistics network, and Supply Chain by Amazon allows the company to capitalize from it outside of its core e-commerce business.\n\nE-commerce will continue to be Amazon's main revenue driver, and Amazon Web Services will be its main profit generator, but it's encouraging to see other segments beginning to pull their own weight a little more. In the third quarter of 2023, Amazon's third-party seller services revenue grew 20% year over year (YOY). Advertising led the way, growing 26%.\n\nAmazon has its hands in many high-growth industries, so there should be plenty of value to be returned to shareholders as the company continues to expand across industries.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Efficiency and cost cuts — two words uttered countless times by CEOs on earnings calls over the past 12 months — will likely be a theme again for corporate America in 2024.\n\nBut this year won’t necessarily be a rinse and repeat moment for business leaders. The pendulum of the job market will likely swing back to employers, creating a \"perfect storm\" for businesses focused on boosting productivity, contends Glassdoor Lead Economist Daniel Zhao.\n\n“The job market is expected to cool but remain resilient, which may be a perfect storm for businesses to focus on efficiency and productivity in 2024,” Zhao said.\n\nProductivity among US workers started to improve during the third quarter of 2023 but lags its long-term trend. Labor productivity has grown at an annual rate of 1.5% during the current business cycle, compared to the long-term rate of 2.1%.\n\nWhile improved profitability and cost-savings is music to the ears of shareholders as investors shift their focus from growth to profitability, for the American workforce, the message from management may be to work harder — in other words, do more with less.\n\n“Continued concerns about an economic slowdown mean employers would rather search for cost savings rather than hiring prolifically to maintain growth,” Zhao added.\n\nIn a recent memo to employees, Wayfair (W) CEO Niraj Shah encouraged employees to increase productivity by being \"frugal, agile, customer oriented, and smart\" while putting in extra time at work.\n\n“Working long hours, being responsive, blending work and life, is not anything to shy away from,” Shah wrote, reported first by Business Insider.\n\nShah has cut costs and reduced headcount over the past 18 months to right-size Wayfair's cost structure. The company recently reported its second consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, an achievement Shah called a \"key milestone.\"\n\nAnd Shah is far from alone in his push for efficiency. Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Goldman Sachs’s (GS) David Solomon and Amazon’s (AMZN) Andy Jassy are among a long list of CEOs cutting costs and adjusting headcount in an effort to improve longer-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow this all shakes out for employees and their workloads is still up for debate, but recent data shows workers may no longer have the upper hand, leaving them with little choice other than to do what their companies want.\n\nPlanned job cuts soared 98% in 2023 as fewer companies gave out bonuses, and workers who change jobs are no longer awarded massive pay bumps.\n\n“The premium that we measure from switching jobs versus staying at the same job was 7% at the start of 2023, and that premium has now shrunk to 2.5%,” ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson told me on Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nRichardson added: “The number of workers trying a new job on for size has really shrunk which means there's just not as many opportunities out there. We're still seeing low unemployment but the balance between supply and demand has come closer together.”",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "content": "Many people think of long-term investing as buying and holding a stock for several years instead of succumbing to the psychological temptation of short-term trades. However, holding a stock for decades instead of years could create even bigger generational gains that you could potentially pass on to your children and grandchildren.\n\nFor example, the S&P 500 generated a total return of 102% over the past five years. But over the past 10 years it delivered a total return of 209%. If we stretch out that chart to two decades, its total return jumps to 528%.\n\nBuying and holding a stock for decades can be a hit and miss strategy, since many companies simply aren't built to last that long. Nevertheless, I believe these three stocks (which I personally own) check all the right boxes as \"buy and forget\" investments: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), and LVMH(OTC: LVMUY). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure company. Its sales of ads across its own e-commerce marketplaces, websites, and streaming media platforms also make it one of the world's top advertising companies.\n\nOver the past 20 years, Amazon's stock has risen 5,470%. That growth was initially driven by the expansion of its e-commerce platform, but its cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) also grew over the past decade as its higher-margin revenue turned it into the company's core profit engine. The expansion of AWS and its higher-margin advertising business should also offset the lower margins of its e-commerce marketplace and brick-and-mortar stores for the foreseeable future.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $1.5 trillion, Amazon probably won't replicate those massive gains over the next 20 years. It also faces a lot of competition in the e-commerce market from smaller challengers like PDD's Temu and Shein, while Microsoft remains a formidable foe in the cloud infrastructure market.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite all those challenges, I believe Amazon remains a great stock to buy and hold for the next few decades. It takes scale to survive and thrive in the e-commerce and cloud markets over the long run, and Amazon continues to squeeze profits from both businesses as many of its smaller competitors burn out in this challenging market.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre is the largest e-commerce and digital payments company in Latin America. It generates most of its revenue from Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina.\n\nThe company went public in 2007, and its stock has rallied about 8,340% from its IPO price. That growth was driven by the expansion of its first-party logistics network -- which crossed some tough terrain across Latin America -- as well as rising internet penetration rates and income levels. That early-mover's advantage prevented Amazon, Sea's Shopee, and other overseas challengers from gaining meaningful footholds across the region.\n\nMercadoLibre already served 120 million unique active users across its e-commerce and fintech platforms in its latest quarter, but it has plenty of room to grow. According to Mordor Intelligence, the Latin American e-commerce market could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% from 2023 to 2028.\n\nWith a market cap of $77 billion, MercadoLibre is still a lot smaller than Amazon. It's also generated consistent profits in 2021 and 2022 as economies of scale finally kicked in and diluted its logistics and payment processing costs. Analysts expect those profits to continue rising, so its business model is clearly built to last for decades and drive its stock even higher.\n\n3. LVMH\n\nLVMH is the world's largest high-end luxury company. Its 75 well-known brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Loewe, Fendi, Tiffany & Co., Bulgari, and Sephora, which all generally hold up well during both economic recessions and expansions.\n\nUnlike mid-range luxury brands, which rely heavily on middle class shoppers, LVMH targets the most affluent customers who are well-insulated from the macro headwinds. It's broadly diversified across a wide range of luxury markets (wines and spirits, fashion and leather, perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewelry, and specialty retail) and countries. Its sales in China and other emerging markets have notably been booming over the past several years.\n\nLVMH's U.S.-listed OTC shares have delivered a total return of more than 410% over the past 10 years and boosted its market cap to nearly $400 billion. It achieved that impressive growth even as the global economy was rocked by recessions, geopolitical conflicts, and the COVID-19 pandemic, and that resilience suggests it will remain an evergreen investment for decades to come as it gradually consolidates a large portion of the high-end luxury market.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer recently said in a program that the time has come for investors to take some profits on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks as the market begins to undergo a rotation. Cramer said “it’s a new market” in 2024 and financial, healthcare and small-cap stocks which were put on the backburner by the Street amid recession fears are now in the spotlight. Cramer said that the market is favoring “boring” stocks with high yields as investors believe recession fears have been managed by the Federal Reserve and rates are expected to come down.\n\nCramer said long-term interest rates peaked in October 2023 and since then high-yield dividend stocks have been “flying\" while Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their leadership position when it comes to stock market gains. Cramer said that during most of 2023 Magnificent Seven stocks, which include major companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), among other tech leaders, led the stock market gains. But after October 2023, things have changed. Cramer shared a chart which showed S&P 500 performance trends on an equal-weighted basis. Data shows that an equal-weighted S&P 500 has beaten the Magnificent Seven index by 13.4% from October 2023 through January 3, 2024.\n\nJim Cramer said that “all sorts of stocks” are now showing strong performance and gains are no longer limited to the seven major tech stocks. Cramer mentioned some major banks and said financial stocks have been among the top performers in the current environment.\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted that there’s a broader money rotation going on in the market right now, with major tech stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Tesla acting as “sources of funds.” That means money managers are taking profits from these stocks and putting these funds into other companies that have hitherto been ignored amid the macro economic backdrop.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article we decided to evaluate the performance of Jim Cramer’s predictions and analysis. Back in September we covered some stocks Jim Cramer was recommending investors to sell. In this article we took a look at the performance of those stocks to see whether Cramer’s predictions and sell calls were right or wrong. For each stock we mentioned its performance over the past few months and the reasons behind Cramer’s bearish outlook on these companies.\n\nThe list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in these companies. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks: How Did They Perform?\n\n12. Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 2\n\nJim Cramer called Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) a “mess” in 2023 and said he was unable to understand how Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) makes money. Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) shares have plummeted about 39% over the past six months. Problems started for Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) last year after a short report from Hindenburg Research accused the company of overstating asset values.\n\nJust two hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 funds had stakes in Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nLast year Cramer remained bullish on quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and kept recommending investors to stay away from money-losing stocks.\n\n11. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 11\n\nBack in August 2023, Jim Cramer said that investing in spacecraft company Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) was akin to “sending your money up in smoke.” Over the past six months the stock has lost about 7% in value. However, December 2023 was a great month for Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) as it announced multiple positive news. The US government awarded Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) a $515 million contract to design, manufacture, deliver, and operate 18 space vehicles.  Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) also successfully launched its 42nd Electron rocket and deployed a satellite for Japan-based Earth imaging company the Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space.\n\n10. Telus Corp (NYSE:TU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nJim Cramer in August 2023 called the Canadian telecom company Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) a “loser” as the analyst believes there are multiple companies in the market doing the same thing as Telus Corp (NYSE:TU).\n\nOver the past six months, Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) shares have lost about 9% in value. In November, Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) upped its quarterly dividend by 3.4%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Telus Corp (NYSE:TU).\n\n9. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nBitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) ranks 9th in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was recommending selling last year. In November 2023, Jim Cramer said the following about the company:\n\n“They don’t make any money...If you want to do Bitcoin, own Bitcoin.”\n\nOver the past six months, Riot Platforms shares have gained about 16%.\n\nEarlier this month, the company said it produced 619 bitcoins in December 2023, a 12% increase month over month and a 9% decline on a yearly basis.\n\n8. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nLast year, when asked about his thoughts on solid state lithium metal battery company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS), Jim Cramer made a “hard pass” on the stock and said “there’s nothing there” about Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The stock has lost about 6.6% over the past six months.\n\nInsider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 20 hedge funds had stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The biggest stakeholder of Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) during this period was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $40 million stake in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS).\n\nThe company in its Q3 earnings call talked about its business performance and guidance:\n\n\"Despite these changes in the timing of CapEx, we continue to target low-volume B samples in 2024 and higher-volume B samples in 2025. During Q3, our CapEx primarily went toward facility and equipment spend for our consolidated QS-0 pre-pilot line, including for our Raptor process. For the remainder of the year, our CapEx will continue to be predominantly allocated toward QS-0. During the quarter, we raised $300 million in gross proceeds from our public follow-on offering. We ended Q3 with over $1.1 billion in liquidity and continue to look for opportunities to optimize our spending and be prudent with our strong balance sheet.\n\nWe now forecast our cash runway will extend into 2026. Any additional funds raised from capital markets activity, including under our ATM prospectus supplement, would further extend this cash runway. Longer term, our capital requirements will be a function of our industrialization business model, which we believe could reflect a mix of wholly owned production, joint venture, and licensing relationships. With that, I’ll hand things over to Jagdeep for a final word on our strategic outlook.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n7. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nIn December 2022, Jim Cramer said the following about EV company Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID):\n\n“We don’t want to fool around with that. The thing just goes down and down. I see a trend. ... I think that one is just too dangerous.”\n\nFast forward to June 2023, Cramer’s thoughts about Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) hadn’t budged as he said, while answering a call about Rivian Automotive, that investors should sell Rivian and Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) because they were money-losing companies.\n\nJim Cramer has been right about the stock since Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) shares have gone nowhere but down. Over the past six months Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) stock lost about 47% in value.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID).\n\n6. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nIn August 2023, Jim Cramer said Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) investors should take profits should the stock bounce back since Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) has “disappointed” for so long.\n\nIn December 2023, Jim Cramer said that he was “pulling the plug” on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) and Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) is now a “no go” for him.\n\nPlug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares have lost about 58% over the past six months.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 26 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). The most significant stakeholder of the firm during this period is Israel Englander’s Millennium Management which owns a $26 million stake in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG).\n\nWhile PLUG is a sell according to Cramer, throughout 2023, he remained bullish on tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company talked about its Q4 guidance in its Q3 earnings call:\n\nIn the fourth quarter, we anticipate the revenue from our new ventures will surpass revenue from our traditional business for the first time as our electrolyzers and cryogenic businesses continue to grow. Finally, I’d like to just like to reflect on the conversation I had yesterday morning with a European customer supplier and partner. He gets toward our facilities and remind me that no one has built hydrogen infrastructure on the scale we have. No one has our product set, no one has technical talent, no one has our customer relationships and no one has our real life experiences. It remains our belief and his there is the market for hydrogen fuel cell grows, no one is in a better position than Plug to take advantage of this opportunity. This is just a bump on the road.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires 13 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now George Soros and Jim Cramer Love These Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 10 Years?",
        "content": "The best stock market returns accumulate over decades rather than quarters. That's why billionaire investor Warren Buffett cites his longevity as a key supporting factor in his portfolio's massive growth over the last several decades. \"It helps to start early and live into your 90's,\" he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in this year's annual report.\n\nGrowth-stock investors can seek to replicate some of his success by taking a much longer outlook on their investments. With that goal in mind, let's look at Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) prospects for success in the coming decade. Where will the business, and the stock, be by early 2034?\n\nServices over products\n\nE-commerce will always be a big part of Amazon's business, but the future seems to be all about its services sales. That segment is anchored by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and includes things like Prime subscriptions and advertising sales. Through the first three quarters of 2023, that unit clocked in at $226 billion, or 56% of sales, and was expanding at a much faster rate than the e-commerce segment.\n\nIt wouldn't be a stretch to think that in a decade, Amazon's business might look more like Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) does today. It will sell products, sure, but almost all its profits will come from cloud and software services.\n\nThis shift has a good shot at enhancing profitability and boosting cash flow, as investors have already seen in the last few quarters. Amazon likely won't have Microsoft's 40% profit margin by 2034 but should post much stronger results than its current 4% level. And positive stock returns will track along with those financial improvements.\n\nGenerating profits\n\nIf you don't think artificial intelligence (AI) is a priority for Amazon, consider that the term \"generative AI\" showed up 18 times in its most recent earnings release. That tech is now deeply embedded in the AWS platform, which is already helping many of its biggest customers with their own AI projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is also using it to improve the shopping and selling experiences on its e-commerce store, for example by sifting through product reviews to highlight factors that previous buyers have frequently mentioned.\n\nThere's no telling how AI will develop over the next decade, but it appears likely that Amazon will join other tech giants like Microsoft in leading the shift into this computing era. It's also unclear right now what impact the technology will have on Amazon's finances.\n\nThe early signs are encouraging, though. Generative AI is popular because it is creating more value across a wide range of business processes. That makes it probable that the technology will lift Amazon's profit margins even as it helps accelerate sales growth in the next decade.\n\nThe price change\n\nAmazon is currently valued more like a retailer than a software-as-a-service stock. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3 is closer to eBay's P/S of 2 than it is to Microsoft's ratio of 13 times annual sales.\n\nAmazon should close that gap with Microsoft over time if it continues shifting its business toward services sales while capitalizing on the AI boom. Many factors -- including a slowdown in spending on information technology, or a wider recession -- could delay or even derail these ambitions.\n\nBut Amazon stock seems primed to generate solid returns for patient investors over the next several years.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Amazon made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 18, 2023\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Sell in January Before They Crash and Burn",
        "content": "Growth stocks performed well in 2023. Many stocks rallied as investors felt the optimism and lower inflation readings made people anticipate interest rate reductions in 2024.\n\nThe rally picked up many stocks that had disappointing performances in 2022. However, markets with widespread appreciation can present many overvalued stocks that are at risk of losing ground.\n\nGrowth stocks look strong heading into 2024, but these stocks may underperform in the New Year. Investors may want to approach a few growth stocks with caution.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEtsy (ETSY)  Etsy logo is over an orange background with a little shopping cart with packages in it. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nIt’s amazing what a few years can do to a growth narrative. Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) was a top e-commerce stock before the pandemic and came to prominence in 2020. The stock was a top winner, and rightfully so, due to rapidly expanding revenue and earnings. Etsy was gobbling up market share, and there was more to its success than mask sales.\n\nEtsy’s third quarter report shows the continuation of a glaring problem. Consolidated gross merchandise sales only grew by 1.2% year-over-year. While the company ended up with 7% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter, that revenue growth only came because Etsy is continuing to squeeze its buyers and sellers. The platform’s gross sales aren’t growing by much, and Etsy can only squeeze out extra money from its participants.\n\nEtsy’s leadership cited headwinds and used that as justification to lay off 11% of its staff. I call foul for that reason. Despite having less room to grow, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been reporting higher revenue growth in recent quarters than Etsy. Amazon’s e-commerce store revenue growth exceeded Etsy’s growth in the third quarter. It wasn’t just Amazon Web Services.\n\nEtsy is a smaller company, which means it has a larger untapped market and should theoretically have higher revenue and earnings growth to justify a high valuation. Most e-commerce companies have been growing and reporting good quarters. Etsy hasn’t, if we look at consolidated gross merchandise sales growth, a critical metric for understanding long-term prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nEtsy CEO mentioned that the company has more than doubled in size since 2019. That meant something for the growth narrative when we were in 2021. Growth investors in 2024 may not want to hear about a company that has doubled in size from 2019 to 2021 and has remained roughly flat ever since.\n\nCost-cutting measures can help with profits in the short run, but if gross merchandise sales stay where they are, it doesn’t matter in the long run.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s unfair to think of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as only a car company. Software is a growing component of the company’s business model, which is largely driven by the company’s Full Self-Driving Suite. Goldman Analyst Mark Delaney predicts the company can generate tens of billions of dollars per year from software products by 2030. All of that revenue would be recurring.\n\nHowever, the company’s stock looks overextended as revenue growth slows down and year-over-year net income growth falls into negative territory for some of the most recent quarters.\n\nFor instance, Tesla only reported 8.8% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and a 43.7% year-over-year decline in net income. The electric vehicle company missed many estimates in their latest quarter.\n\nTesla doesn’t sell as many vehicles as traditional brands but boasts higher profit margins. Tesla’s margins can come under pressure as the company lowers the prices of some of its models.\n\nSubscriptions can elevate profit margins compared to peers, but the company faces several challenges. The loss of EV tax credits for some models may force the company to reduce the prices of their vehicles even more to reach a broader market.\n\nGrowth has been slowing down in recent quarters and can result in a challenging year for the stock.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed across\n\nSource: xalien / Shutterstock\n\nIt’s easy to feel bullish about any traditional media company that has embraced streaming. These companies have lost billions of dollars in platforms that continue to drain money from their accounts.\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been an exception to this rule by becoming a profitable enterprise with net profit margins that are approaching 20%. Netflix has been recovering in 2023 and recently closed out the third quarter with 7.8% year-over-year revenue growth. Global streaming paid memberships grew by 10.8% year-over-year to reach 247.15 million subscribers.\n\nThe company projects exceeding 10% year-over-year revenue growth to close out the final quarter. Revenue growth has accelerated in 2023, but the stock looks richly valued relative to its revenue and earnings growth.\n\nShares currently trade at a 31-forward P/E ratio. A 65% gain in 2023 feels excessive due to the company’s relatively light financial growth. Netflix is undoubtedly the streaming winner, but shares look overvalued for now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 2 Top AI Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "2023 was a year of recovery for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which jumped 43% amid the easing of inflation and other macroeconomic challenges that hurt stocks in 2022. But if history is anything to go by, the rally could be just getting started. According to an analysis of data going back to 1971, the index has surged by an average of 19% every year following a bear-market rebound like the one we experienced in 2023.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could make great ways to bet on this pattern repeating itself in 2024 and beyond -- especially as both companies develop their new growth strategies around artificial intelligence (AI) technology.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWith shares up 236% over the last 12 months, Nvidia was one of the Nasdaq's biggest winners in 2023 -- helping drive the index's recovery after its slump in 2022. The tech giant is riding a wave of demand for its data center chips for large language models -- the technology behind AI chatbots. And with these applications becoming increasingly demanding, Nvidia's boom might be just getting started.\n\nWhile 2023 was a breakout year for AI, the technology is still in its nascent stage. As an article in Time noted, the rate at which AI is surpassing humans at various tasks is accelerating, which could unlock new and increasingly complex use cases. Nvidia is at the forefront of this trend because of its industry-leading chips like the H100, sales of which helped power its 206% year-over-year revenue jump to $18.12 billion in the third quarter.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia is not the only game in town. Rival Advanced Micro Devices is racing to capture a slice of the opportunity with new AI chips of its own. But with industry experts projecting the market for that hardware to grow tenfold to $400 billion by 2027, there seems to be plenty of room for more players to get involved without significantly eroding Nvidia's revenue growth and margins.\n\nThe company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24 also means shares are reasonably valued compared to the Nasdaq's average of 29.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nWith a market cap of $1.55 trillion, Amazon is one of the world's largest companies. And this didn't happen by accident. The tech giant's success has hinged on its ability to quickly grow its footprint in new industries -- from e-commerce to cloud computing. Now, AI technologies could help power its next phase of expansion.\n\nAmazon is weaving AI into most aspects of its operations. And this includes product recommendations, fulfillment optimization, and its virtual assistant, Alexa, which is being boosted with new conversational abilities. But the greatest impact will probably be felt in Amazon Web Services (AWS), where it is building a platform for enterprise clients to create and scale their own AI applications.\n\nEmblematic of these efforts was Amazon's announcement in September of its plans to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an AI research start-up similar to ChatGPT creator OpenAI. As part of the deal, Athropic will use AWS cloud services to train and deploy its models, potentially serving as a proof of concept for Amazon's new Trainium and Inferentia AI data center chips, which it designed to be high-performance, low-cost alternatives to third-party hardware.\n\nTrading at a forward P/E ratio of 38, Amazon's stock is more expensive than the average Nasdaq stock. But that premium seems reasonable, considering it is a well-diversified blue-chip company with a long track record of success.\n\nAnother banger year?\n\nNothing is guaranteed in the stock market, but investors have many reasons to be optimistic about 2024. For starters, the high inflation that caused so much trouble over the past two years has largely been reined in, and the Federal Reserve is likely to lower benchmark interest rates this year, making it easier for companies to access the funds they need to maintain and grow their businesses.\n\nThat could be a shot in the arm for AI start-ups, many of which make use of Nvidia and Amazon's enterprise-focused AI solutions. Both tech giants look poised to succeed in 2024 and beyond, and it is not too late for investors to bet on their long-term success.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "War, weather put ocean shippers on notice for rough seas in 2024",
        "content": "By Lisa Baertlein\n\nLOS ANGELES, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Recent hostilities in the Red Sea have thrown global shippers of vital goods for a loop - but it is hardly the only issue that big carriers are facing as 2024 kicks off.\n\nGiants like Maersk say the industry, which handles 90% of global trade, faces the possibility of significant disruptions, from ongoing wars to droughts affecting key routes like the Panama Canal. Complex vessel schedules are likely to be knocked out of sync for giant container ships, fuel tankers and other commodity haulers throughout the year.\n\nThat will increase delays and raise costs for retailers like Walmart, IKEA and Amazon, as well as food makers such as Nestle and grocers including Lidl.\n\n\"This is seemingly the new normal - these waves of chaos that seem to rise and fall. Before you get back to some level of normalcy another event happens that sort of throws things out of whack,\" said Jay Foreman, CEO of Florida-based Basic Fun, who sends toys from factories in China to Europe and the United States.\n\nAdded 2024 risks include a possible expansion of Red Sea attacks to the Arabian Gulf, which could affect oil shipments, and further souring of China-Taiwan relations that could also affect important trade lanes, said Peter Sand, chief analyst at freight data provider Xeneta. Russia's war in Ukraine continues to affect the grains trade since it invaded its neighbor in 2022.\n\nMaersk on Friday joined other major ocean carriers in rerouting ships away from the Red Sea to avoid missile and drone attacks in an area that leads to the vital Asia-Europe Suez Canal shortcut. That route handles more than 10% of total ocean shipments and nearly one-third of the world's container trade.\n\nWhile tankers carrying oil and fuel supplies for Europe continue to pass through the Suez Canal, most container ships are rerouting goods around Africa's southern tip as Yemeni Houthis attack vessels in the Red Sea in a show of support for Palestinian Islamist group Hamas fighting Israel in Gaza.\n\nStory continues\n\nShip owners' fuel costs are up as much as $2 million per round trip for Suez Canal diversions and the Asia-Europe spot rate has more than doubled from 2023's average to $3,500 per 40-foot container. The increased costs could translate into higher prices for consumers, though Goldman Sachs said on Friday that the inflation shock should not be as bad as the 2020-22 pandemic chaos.\n\n\"The first quarter is gonna be a little crazy for everybody's books\" when it comes to costs, said Alan Baer, CEO of OL USA, which handles freight shipments for clients.\n\nCrossings through the Panama Canal, a Suez Canal alternative, are down 33% due to lower water levels, according to supply chain software provider project44. Such restrictions helped send dry bulk shipping costs for commodities like wheat, soybeans, iron ore, coal and fertilizer sharply higher in late 2023.\n\nIncreasingly frequent severe weather events are having a more immediate effect than political tensions. Brazil suffered a double-whammy of a historic drought on the Amazon and excessive rains in the north of the country that contributed to a longer-than-usual ship queue at the port of Paranagua in late 2023 just months ahead of peak soybean shipping season.\n\n\"You can always say, 'It's a one-off event,' but if the one-off events happen every other month, they're not anymore one-off events,\" said John Kartsonas, managing partner at Breakwave Advisors, the commodity trading advisor for the Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tiger Global Management snapped a two-year losing streak with a 28.5% gain in 2023, topping peers such as Viking Global Investors and Coatue Management, in what turned out to be a strong year for old-fashioned stock-pickers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHuawei Teardown Shows 5nm Chip Made in Taiwan, Not China Business Insider Says Ackman’s Wife Plagiarized in Her Thesis Troubled China Shadow Bank Zhongzhi Files for Bankruptcy Just a Billion Doesn’t Cut It on This Exclusive Florida Island Islamic State Claims Responsibility for Deadly Iran Blasts\n\nThe funds got a boost from a rally in stocks in the fourth quarter that lifted the S&P 500 to a 26% return for the year and made long-short equity the best-performing hedge fund strategy. Still, much of that was driven by a small group of stocks that posted blowout gains, including Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nAnd some of the so-called Tiger Cubs that focus on technology stocks, including Tiger Global, sharply underperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index, which returned 45%. Coatue’s main fund rose 21.5%, according to people familiar with the matter. The main hedge fund at Viking, which has less tech-stock exposure than its peers, gained 13.8%.\n\nSome stock-picking giants are still trying to dig themselves out of disastrous losses from 2022, when tech stocks plunged and valuations of private companies spiraled. Tiger Global’s hedge fund plunged 56% that year after losing 7% in 2021, meaning it will have to return about 90% to recoup those declines. Its long-only fund, which lost 67% in 2022, gained 20.4% last year.\n\nCoatue’s hedge fund fell 34% in 2022, while Whale Rock’s sank 45%. Whale Rock gained 31.8% last year.\n\nLast year’s gains for tech-focused stock-pickers were “almost an inverse of performance in 2022,” said Jon Caplis, founder of data provider PivotalPath.\n\n“Last March they brought their leverage and equity market exposure down by almost 40% and haven’t increased it since then,” he said. “That’s why they didn’t capture nearly as much of the upside when the Nasdaq rallied.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2022, the group captured 68% of the Nasdaq’s decline, and this year they only captured 37% of its gain, Caplis said. PivotalPath’s Equity Sector Technology, Media and Telecom Index, which tracks performance of TMT funds, gained 16% last year.\n\nViking Global’s reduced technology exposure helped the firm weather 2022 far better than its Tiger peers, but that strategy may have limited its upside in 2023. Short wagers also ate into returns.\n\nRead More: Hedge Fund Clients Seek Out Stock-Pickers After Tough 2022\n\nAnthony Bozza’s $2.5 billion Lakewood Capital Management made money on financial stocks in the US and Europe in 2023, as well as value-oriented long bets, gaining 23.4%, according to people familiar with the firm.\n\nThe firm took advantage of the market panic around the regional banking crisis, scooping up larger bank stocks as well as some regional players, one of the people said. The firm declined to comment.\n\nMixed Fortunes\n\nMeanwhile, macro funds had mixed fortunes last year.\n\nOne of the biggest losers was Haidar Capital Management, which tumbled 43.5% in 2023, its biggest-ever loss in more than two decades of trading. Bridgewater Associates’s Pure Alpha II fund slumped 7.6% after losses in the last two months of the year wiped out earlier gains.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, emerging-markets-focused Discovery Capital — another Tiger cub — gained 48%.\n\nThe VIX, a closely followed measure of volatility in the markets, is near historic lows, which usually presages a difficult time for macro. But some managers are expecting more short-term volatility in the Treasury market ahead of rate cuts.\n\nMultistrategy funds — which gained clout, assets and the attention of regulators over the past two years — ended 2023 in the middle of the pack. Their gains in the mid-to-high teens fell back in line with their historical norms, after some posted strong returns in 2022.\n\nRepresentatives for the firms either declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nHere’s a look at 2023 returns for other hedge funds:\n\n--With assistance from Gillian Tan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy America’s Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs These Are the Five Potential Trouble Spots That Could Knock the Global Economy Off Course Eight Tech Products That Could Define 2024 Gen Zers Who Want the Buzz But Not the Hangover Are Fueling a Nonalcoholic Spirits Boom AI Hallucinations Are a Boon to Creatives\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "With consumer sentiment on the rise after a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, the recent Black Friday sales and holiday season are expected to boost Q4 sales and revenue for e-commerce companies. The improving economy and high consumer spending create an optimistic outlook for the new year and point to the strength of e-commerce stocks for 2024.\n\nPost-pandemic, online retail is more popular than ever, with almost 80% of Americans shopping online and more than 55% preferring to shop online. Those percentages will inevitably continue to grow with each generation of new consumers. That’s why now is an opportune time to consider top e-commerce stocks for potential gains. Investors should seize the opportunity to explore this sector as it has significant upside potential amid a market that generated $1.09 trillion in sales in 2022 alone.\n\nHere are three amazing e-commerce stocks for 2024 that investors should consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn under three decades, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) went from a garage startup to the world’s second-largest company by revenue, trailing only behind its rival, Walmart (NYSE:WMT). It has sustained robust growth, defying expectations of a mature enterprise. Amazon’s cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and digital advertising segments are pivotal contributors to its expansion. This is favorable for AMZN stock investors as the company’s future growth will not be solely reliant on the retail segment.\n\nSignificantly, the company is heavily invested in streamlined processes, logistics software and regional fulfillment networks, resulting in reduced delivery times and improved services. In 2023, Amazon achieved its fastest delivery speeds, attracting more customers, particularly for consumables and everyday essentials.\n\nThe company’s ongoing innovations in its fulfillment network aim to enhance efficiency, ensuring it remains a retail stock poised for revenue growth this year. Plus, the tech giant’s dominance in e-commerce suggests significant returns in 2024 and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith its monthly subscription model, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) secures reliable annual recurring revenue for online stores, fostering customer loyalty.\n\nThe company impressed investors with a 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase to $1.7 billion and a 36% YOY rise in gross profit. SHOP stock soared 107% in 2023, reaching $74, showing strong signs of improvement and potential for further growth. Despite currently being at its 52-week high, hitting $100 soon is plausible. The company’s business model, benefiting both Shopify and its merchants, contributes to its success.\n\nWhile the stock is pricey, it remains one of the top investment choices for e-commerce stocks. Though it’s early to declare Shopify a holiday season winner, it’s on track to be one, and definitely an e-commerce stock for 2024 to pay attention to.\n\nPrologis (PLD) The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNumerous experts in the real estate sector offer bold predictions for the 2024 supply chain, with Prologis (NYSE:PLD) among the key real estate companies worth considering. A logistics-focused Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), Prologis is a direct beneficiary of the e-commerce boom, and one of the top industrial real estate picks in this market.\n\nMany of the positive forecasts for Prologis are based on two key factors. First, an anticipated doubling of private equity real estate funding due to expected interest rate declines. Second, the assumption that the Federal Reserve will be done hiking interest rates and revert to cuts.\n\nCurrently, analysts are predicting a one-year target price range of $125 to $157 for PLD stock. With strong financials, Q3 2023 revenue reached $1.99 billion, showing an 8.1% one-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Prologis demonstrated robust profitability and effective leveraging, with $33.6 billion in liabilities and $91.9 billion in assets, growing 57.8% and 50.8% YOY, respectively.\n\nWith a market cap of $120 billion, Prologis emphasizes high-barrier, high-growth markets, ensuring economic resilience and tenant commitment. The company’s decades-long consistent profitability and a robust three-year revenue growth rate of 13% underscore its financial strength.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald held a LONG position in AMZN. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value",
        "content": "In 2023, an extraordinary phenomenon unfolded in the stock market: The Magnificent Seven, a group of top-tier stocks, experienced a remarkable surge in their value, ranging from a solid 50% gain to a staggering 240% climb.\n\nThis impressive performance catapulted them into the spotlight as some of the market's most lucrative investments.\n\nAmid this financial whirlwind, a particular focus has been placed on Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Savvy investors, delving into the nuanced world of financial metrics, have pointed out the company's forward price-earnings ratio is notably lower compared to its peers in the Magnificent Seven, raising concern.\n\nAlphabet's valuation portrays the market's anticipation of its future, influenced by pivotal factors such as the seismic shifts brought about by artificial intelligence-driven changes in online consumer behavior, Google's fluctuating share in the digital advertising market and the looming shadow of an antitrust lawsuit. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nDecoding market dynamics: How Google stands in the competitive landscape\n\nThe market attributes a higher price-earnings ratio to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), while Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) falls within a comparable range when juxtaposed with Alphabet.\n\nThe price-earnings ratio is not an arbitrary figure that an investor can assign to determine value, as it has implicit cash flow assumptions. A business that generates a high return on invested capital has more potential to drive growth in cash flow. A high ROIC indicates a company's superior profitability and efficiency in capital allocation. This distinction becomes evident when comparing Apple and Microsoft to Google and Meta.\n\nApple and Microsoft have consistently outperformed Google and Meta in terms of return on invested capital. Their last 10-year average ROICs stood at 25.90% and 16.6%, respectively, while Google and Meta's stood at 13% and 16.20%, respectively. As a result, the figures show the other three peer companies have outperformed Google in terms of profitability and capital efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the contrary, the other three companies in this group, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may not boast impressive ROIC, but their allure lies in higher growth potential, for which investors willingly pay a premium. Specifically, Nvidia and Tesla, being smaller in terms of revenue size, contribute to their distinct valuation dynamics. Meanwhile, Amazon consistently maintains a high price-earnings ratio due to investor optimism surrounding its expanding presence in the retail sector and dominance in the cloud business.\n\nHowever, the search giant's declining market share in digital ad revenue is generating concerns, introducing a nuanced landscape. Lastly, the increasing use cases of AI represent both an opportunity and a threat to its existing business model, while developments in anti-trust lawsuits add a layer of skepticism. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhat are the concerns for Alphabet that are embedded in the price-earnings multiple?\n\nAlphabet recently outperformed expectations for its quarterly performance, beating earnings per share estimates by 6%, rebounding from a slowdown experienced in previous quarters. However, apprehensions persist, particularly concerning Google's search and overall ad revenue business. Lastly, its search revenue accounts for approximately 57% of total revenue and around 73% of total advertising revenue. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhile you may consider it cyclical, the declining market share in digital ad revenue does pose a question of whether Alphabet is losing its long-established dominance in this space.\n\nMeta Platforms and Amazon continue to gain market share in the digital ad revenue market, while Google experiences a decline. Moreover, the way we retrieve information on the internet is changing. AI chatbots are supplanting many of the activities we traditionally performed on search engines. The company realizes the threat to search ad revenue, prompting it to actively address the challenge and make rapid strides in integrating AI across all its services. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: InsiderIntelligence.com\n\nThe recent launch of Gemini, a family of large language models by Google, seems exciting, as it can counter the threat of other LLMs like GPT-4, Claude and Llama. However, it still needs to solve the challenges in the existing business model, where search contributes the most to the business.\n\nAlphabet's cloud division has experienced impressive growth, yet it operates in a highly competitive landscape where Amazon and Microsoft dominate. Investors are dissatisfied with the recent slowdown in the growth of the cloud business, which decreased to 22.5% year over year during the third quarter from 37.6% a year prior.\n\nGoogle's legal battle and the future of search\n\nAlphabet's Google is under legal scrutiny amid allegations of employing questionable tactics to uphold its status as the world's foremost search engine. The U.S. Justice Department claims Google paid massive sums to companies like Apple to make it the default search engine on their devices. Google also admitted that it shares 36% of revenue with Apple for the search results on the iPhone. We could draw several scenarios from this lawsuit.\n\nThe first scenario is that Google wins the case and stays the default search engine on devices like iPhones, and their partnership with Apple remains the same.\n\nThere is another scenario that may go in favor of Google. If the DOJ compels Apple to display a choice screen where users can select their preferred search engine, a majority would likely choose Google, and the search giant would not have to pay anything to Apple.\n\nBut the worst-case scenario would be that Apple develops its own native search engine that would be the default for its Safari browser on all devices, and users would not have any choice.\n\nBeing a default search engine is a huge advantage because most people who put search queries on the browser address bar need to intuitively think about which search engine they post their queries in.\n\nSince Apple will be losing out on revenue from Google in this scenario, there is a possibility that it will try to come up with its own native search engine to recoup the lost revenue. Hence, this scenario could harm Google's search revenue as Safari, Apple's native browser, holds around 20% market share.\n\nWaymo's expansion and Wing's drone delivery partnership with Walmart\n\nGoogle's other bets include several projects. In the recent earnings call, the company mentioned Waymo (an autonomous driving technology company) onboarded more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually added over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist.\n\nAt the same time, Wing, a drone delivery service owned by Google, has unveiled a strategic collaboration with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to offer drone delivery services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nWhile these developments are exciting, they have yet to reach a level of significance that would substantially impact the company's financials or long-term potential.\n\nFurther, in the age of AI, how we retrieve information online is changing. While Google is responding to these changes, its predominant business model, centered around search engine queries, faces potential risks stemming from shifts in how users consume information.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a new digital era, the shift from traditional search engines to AI-driven chatbots marks a pivotal change in consumer behavior. The relentless advancement of LLMs is poised to revolutionize how we seek information, potentially rendering traditional search queries obsolete. This evolution raises critical questions about the future of advertising in an AI-dominated landscape.\n\nWhile the full extent of these changes remains shrouded in the mists of the future, their potential impact on giants like Alphabet cannot be underestimated. For investors, concerns over these AI-induced shifts challenging the company's dominance in search revenue are justified and crucial in navigating the uncertain waters of technological progression.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "CE Pro magazine is a leading trade publication for the custom electronics business. Its readers include homebuilders, small- and medium-sized businesses, and individual homeowners.\n\nOn Jan. 2, CE Pro’s editor-in-chief, Arlen Schweiger, summarized the year for the 55 smart home stocks that are part of the publication’s Smart Home Stock Index. The index rebounded nicely in 2023 with solid performances from many components, including four of the Magnificent 7. According to Schweiger, 80% of the components in the index produced positive returns for their shareholders in the past year.\n\nMany names aren’t pure-play smart home stocks, possessing operations in other areas and industries. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has smart home products such as Alexa, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick, Ring smart home doorbells and thermostats, while it also owns MGM Studios, Whole Foods and many others.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWho will be the big winner amongst smart home stocks in 2024? Here are three names I’m thinking about.\n\nNRG Energy (NRG) Close up of NRG logo on website against blurred background.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I said in the intro, there aren’t many pure-play smart home stocks. Although NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) is a major utility, it makes the index because of its 2023 acquisition of Vivint Smart Home Inc. for an enterprise value of $5.2 billion, approximately 6.3x the pure play’s adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).\n\nVivint’s smart home platform brought nearly two million customers who used its various products and services, including security systems, security cameras, doorbell cameras, smart thermostats, etc.\n\nIn the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2023, Vivint generated $478 million in revenue, accounting for more than 6% of NRG’s overall revenue. In the nine months, it was $1.07 billion, or 5.1% of NRG’s $20.9 billion. However, the nine months is only six months of actual results because NRG acquired Vivint on March 10, 2023, which accounted for nearly 8% overall.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the addition of Vivint’s two million customers, NRG will be able to cross-sell to all 7.4 million of its customers in 2024 and beyond, providing more predictable earnings through Vivint’s subscription-based business model.\n\nNRG stock is up 62% over the past year, trading within a few pennies of its all-time high of $52.16 as of this writing.\n\nAllegion (ALLE) a cell phone with\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAllegion (NYSE:ALLE) describes itself as “a pure-play global provider of security products and solutions,” its website states. As part of its business, it provides Internet of Things (IoT), new technology, and electronic solutions for its customers from 29 production facilities in the U.S., Mexico and several other countries.\n\nIt has two operating segments: Allegion Americas and Allegion International. Its brands include Schlage, Kryptonite, Von Duprin, Stanley Access Technologies, Steelcraft and Yonomi.\n\nAn example of what it does in the Smart Home segment is the products sold by its Stanley Access Technologies division, which it acquired in July 2022 for nearly $1 billion. It bought the unit from Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK), which provides automated access solutions to the commercial market. It operates under Allegion Americas.\n\nIn its Q3 2023, like many businesses, volumes were lower, offset by higher prices, leading to flat year-over-year revenue growth combined with higher margins and significant earnings growth.\n\n“Demand for our electronics solutions remains strong. We delivered mid-teens organic growth in electronics and software solutions in the quarter, and we continue to see a long runway for further adoption,” stated CEO John Stone.\n\nAs a result of its strong earnings in the quarter, the company raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2023 to $6.85 at the midpoint of its outlook. Its stock trades at less than 18x earnings based on its current share price.\n\nUp less than 50% over the past five years, 2024 could be a breakout year for Allegion.\n\nSmartRent (SMRT) man holding digital tablet with AR interior design software chooses 3D furniture for home\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock\n\nSmartRent (NYSE:SMRT) provides smart home and smart property solutions for owners of multifamily residential buildings. It serves 15 of the top 20 owners and operators of U.S. multifamily properties.\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2023, the company announced that The Towbes Group, a California-based multifamily investor and property manager, will roll out SmartRent’s access control and IoT solutions at 2,500 apartment homes owned by Towbes.\n\n“SmartRent’s fully customizable IoT systems enable operators to capture the intrinsic NOI of each asset. Community-specific IoT is essential to seamless operations, energy savings and property protection,” stated its December press release.\n\nWhile there is no question that this type of technology is necessary for large owners of multifamily real estate, the collapse of its share price over the past five years would suggest that its business has deteriorated.\n\nHowever, revenue growth isn’t the problem. In 2023, revenues are expected to increase by nearly 40%, raising the number of rental units using SmartRent to more than 680,000.\n\nThe problem is its profitability or lack thereof.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2023, it expects adjusted EBITDA of $19.9 million, on $176.6 million in revenue, down from a $60.6 million adjusted EBITDA loss of $60.6 million a year earlier. It is projecting adjusted EBITDA profitability in Q4 2023.\n\nWith the company likely to be free cash flow positive in 2024, now would be a good time for aggressive investors to consider investing in this smart home pure play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Peloton (PTON) Stock Is Still Spinning Its Wheels Despite TikTok Deal",
        "content": "Good news for Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) fans. The struggling and unprofitable exercise bike and fitness class company, beloved by suburbanites looking to shed some pounds while overly excited trainers scream at them to pedal faster, appears to have gotten a lifeline from TikTok, the social media app favored by the teen children of all those Peloton-using moms and dads.\n\nShares of Peloton soared nearly 15% Thursday and were up another 12% Friday morning on the news of the TikTok partnership. Peloton and TikTok said that they are creating #TikTokFitness, which they described as “a dedicated, co-branded hub that houses custom Peloton content.” What’s particularly notable about this is the fact that it’s the first time Peloton is producing original content outside of its own channels.\n\nPeloton Wants Partnerships to Work Out\n\nIt makes sense for Peloton to do this. The company has fallen on extremely hard times after getting a huge boost during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Shares soared in 2020 as people stopped going out as much to gyms and exercised more at home. Peloton shares hit an all-time high of about $171 in January 2021. It’s all been a painful downhill ride since then.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven after the stock’s surge this week, shares still trade for a little less than $7 apiece. Can TikTok save Peloton?\n\nPeloton has inked other strategic deals in the past two years, including a partnership with athletic apparel leader Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) as well as deals to sell equipment and accessories on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and at Dick’s Sporting Goods. (NYSE:DKS).\n\nBut despite these and other deals (Peloton also has partnerships with the NBA and WNBA, the University of Michigan and the Liverpool soccer team) the company continues to bleed red ink. Peloton posted a net loss of $159 million in its most recent quarter. That follows a nearly $1.3 billion loss in its last fiscal year. Most alarmingly, Peloton is also losing customers. The company ended its latest quarter with 6.4 million members, down from 6.7 million a year earlier. Revenue generated from selling equipment tumbled 12% too.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be sure, CEO Barry McCarthy, who joined Peloton in 2022 after previously serving as CFO of subscription-based streaming media giants Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), has taken steps to try and boost Peloton’s subscriber base. But growth in both the number of people subscribing for its training services as well as overall subscription revenue has been sluggish. What’s more, Peloton posted a year-over-year 13% drop for subscribers to its paid app in its latest quarter. McCarthy conceded in Peloton’s most recent shareholder letter following earnings that the company has been “less successful at engaging and retaining free users and converting them to paying memberships than we expected.”\n\n2024 Resolution: Avoid PTON Stock\n\nIt’s no wonder then that many on Wall Street are still skeptical that the turnaround strategy will succeed. Of the 17 analysts who cover the stock, a dozen have a “hold” rating on it, with just four “buys” as well as one “sell” recommendation. Analysts are predicting more losses for this fiscal year as well as through fiscal 2025. Revenue is expected to tumble 2% this year and only rebound 5% next year to about $2.9 billion. To put that in perspective, Peloton’s sales hit a peak of $4 billion in fiscal 2021. The company boldly predicted after reporting those results that revenue would hit $5.4 billion in fiscal 2022. It wound up coming in at just $3.6 billion.\n\nSo even though many people may be looking to get in shape as one of their New Year’s resolutions, investors should still resolve to avoid Peloton stock. Despite the TikTok deal, the company faces an arduous uphill climb to get back to its glory days of 2020.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

        "content": "Sometimes, the “buy low, sell high” principle is better in theory than in practice. Just because PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock lost money for investors in 2023, doesn’t mean it will stage a huge comeback in 2024. So, let go of your assumptions and think about PayPal’s risks before placing any trades.\n\nValue investors shouldn’t jump to any conclusions based on PayPal’s price-to-earnings ratio or any other metric. After all, just because a stock has declined, this doesn’t automatically make it a bargain. When all is said and done, you may end up regretting it if you jump headfirst into a position in PayPal stock.\n\nA Less-Than-Stellar Year for PYPL Stock\n\nIt’s been said that a rising tide lifts all boats, but this isn’t literally true in every case. For instance, you could have simply bought a fund tracking the S&P 500 and gained nearly 24% in 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBetter yet, you could have bought and held a popular technology stock, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, and posted excellent returns.\n\nYet, the rising tide of the technology market didn’t lift PayPal stock, which lost nearly 20% in 2023. And speaking of Amazon, PayPal suffered a major blow in late 2023 when Amazon announced that it’s dropping PayPal’s Venmo as a payment processing option at checkout.\n\nThis certainly won’t help PayPal improve its active user numbers (or its reputation, for that matter). It’s a problem that will affect PayPal in the new year, as Amazon won’t accept Venmo on the site mobile app as of Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nTo quote Evercore ISI analyst David Togut, the Amazon-related “news creates concern around PayPal’s ability to monetize on these platforms.” The implication, it seems, is that PayPal might lose more partnerships beyond the one that Venmo had with Amazon.\n\nWill the ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ Trend Boost PayPal Stock?\n\nOne of the primary themes in the financial media during 2023’s holiday shopping season was “buy now, pay later.” This trend received constantcoverage, and PayPal stock has been identified as a possible beneficiary of the BNPL hype.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, now it’s time for a post-holiday reality check. Trends come and go, and the financial media was almost entirely focused on the “buy now” part of BNPL. It’s the “pay later” part that’s potentially problematic, as some consumers might end up defaulting on their shopping-spree payment obligations.\n\nItay Vinik, chief investment officer at Equi, offered sobering remarks on this topic.\n\n“One of the things I’m worried about is that holiday spending is going to be strong, but it’s going to be a sugar rush… Then we’re going to pay the price for that,” Vinik warned.\n\nThe BNPL hype cycle was exciting in late 2023, no doubt. However, it probably won’t benefit PayPal when the other shoe drops and shoppers actually have to pay their bills. Don’t count on the BNPL trend to catalyze PayPal stock in the long run.\n\nBrace Yourself for a Letdown With PYPL Stock\n\nFinancial traders did much better in 2023 holding Amazon stock, or even an S&P 500 tracking index fund, than they did with PayPal stock. Looking ahead to the new year, it’s difficult to find a compelling value- or growth-based argument to invest in PayPal.\n\nPlus, it was a serious setback for PayPal when Amazon announced that it’s dropping the Venmo payment option at checkout. Consequently, we don’t currently consider PYPL stock a high-confidence fintech-sector pick for 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Retail Pharmacy &amp; Drugstore Stocks to Watch Amid Industry Headwinds",
        "content": "The three-year-long historic public health crisis significantly altered the structure and trend of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry. On a positive note, amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business witnessed high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Particularly, mail-order pharmacies registered growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring. With digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for industry stalwarts like CVS Health CVS, Herbalife HLF and Rite Aid RADCQ, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\r\n\r\nHowever, the majority of the retail drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of inflation and labor shortages. Further, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. Added to this, with the end of the pandemic, demand for related retail health support has decreased, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players. Last but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there have been a number of new entries, which have increased the competitiveness of the space. Especially, a stalwart like Amazon’s AMZN entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\nStory continues\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even in the current post-pandemic phase, pharmacy retailers experience growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Going by a Patch report during the pandemic, “Two years ago, 11% of U.S. adult pharmacy customers got their prescription from an online pharmacy, based on a survey conducted by market research firm CivicScience, [.] That figure has been steadily rising over the years, according to Statista.com, an online statistics portal.” A 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while in 2022, there was 76% customer reliance on digital platforms, the same shot up to 81% in 2023. The top digital channels cited by mail-order customers were pharmacy websites (59%), mobile apps (34%), and text messages (29%). Accordingly, the companies are strategically attempting to grow digitally.\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs, which hold wide profit margins, are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials. The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs. Meanwhile, to improve operating margins, pharmacy retailers have announced plans to reduce their footprint. In this line, in December 2023, CVS Health stated that it would change the way of pricing its prescription drugs with new pharmacy reimbursement.\n\nAmazon's Entry Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy’s omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report dated Jan 5, 2023, Amazon’s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it to cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market. In October 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. In 2021, a Business Insider report had come up with the speculation that there were discussions about Amazon setting up standalone stores in a few locations, including Boston and Phoenix. Per the report, which cited insider sources, Amazon was exploring plans to place the pharmacies inside Amazon-owned Whole Foods locations. Following its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market.  With several other initiatives in the works, needless to say, Amazon’s entry as a major pharmacy services player is a major blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #194, placing it in the bottom 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 16.7% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale Sector’s rise of 20.1%. The S&P 500 composite has risen 21.6% over the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.67X compared with the S&P 500’s 20.34X and the sector’s 22.70X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.86X, as low as 7.10X, and at the median of 9.21X, as the charts below show.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\n3 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus\n\nCVS Health is currently seeing greater engagement in an expanded set of digital health services such as antibody and PCR testing, vaccinations and omni-channel pharmacy. According to the company, CVS.com is one of the top health websites, with more than 2 billion visits in 2022, up nearly 55% over the prior year. CVS Health’s digital capabilities for health interactions, such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services and sales of health and wellness products, have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues indicates a 9.9% rise from 2022. CVS Health, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, also has an impressive long-term historical earnings growth rate of 6.7%.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPrice and Consensus: CVS\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors.

Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAlphabet’s growing chatbot capabilities will further solidify its presence in the global chatbot market. This, in turn, will strengthen the company’s generative AI efforts, which are acting as key catalysts for the company. Alphabet’s shares have gained 56.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 47.6%.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these efforts are expected to strengthen its presence in the booming generative AI market space.\r\n \r\nPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the chatbot market size is expected to hit $7.01 billion in 2024 and grow to $20.8 billion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 24.3% between 2024 and 2029.\r\n\r\nA Markets and Markets report indicates that the generative AI market will reach $76.8 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 31.5% during the forecast period of 2023-2030.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects in these promising markets presents a significant growth opportunity for Alphabet. This, in turn, is expected to benefit its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%.

        "title": "3 Consumer Stocks to Sell in January Before They Crash and Burn",
        "content": "If you’re looking for consumer stocks to avoid, look no further than the ProShares Online Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:ONLN).\n\nAs its name implies, the ETF tracks the performance of the ProShares Online Retail Index, a collection of retailers that sell their products online or through other non-brick-and-mortar channels.\n\nIn 2023, the ETF generated a total return of 27.4%, 120 basis points better than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). Before you purchase some shares of ONLN, consider that over the past five years, it’s trailed the S&P 500 ETF by 12.22% annually. ONLN is as volatile as it comes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nONLN has just 19 holdings. Many of the names are popular with retail investors. However, it’s a bet on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which accounts for 24.1% of the fund’s net assets.\n\nTwo of the three holdings I’m recommending investors avoid had considerable gains in 2023. The other did not. All of them are consumer stocks to avoid in 2024.\n\nConsumer Stocks to Avoid: Wayfair (W) The Wayfair (W) logo on the screen of a mobile phone with a purple background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Boston-based online furniture and home goods retailer had a good year in 2023. Its shares were up 88%.. However, since it went public in October 2014 at $29 a share, investors who bought in the IPO and still hold have generated a compound annual growth rate of 7.2%, 265 basis points less than the S&P 500.\n\nSince it finished 2023, it’s already lost nearly 11%. You couldn’t ask for a more volatile stock to own.\n\nI’ve never liked Wayfair (NYSE:W) because it sells all kinds of stuff that nobody needs that they can’t get in their hometowns. But worse than that, it doesn’t know how to make money.\n\nAnd just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, CEO and co-founder Niraj Shah dumped on his employees just days before Christmas. Bah, humbug.\n\n“Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics, told CNN’s Richard Quest in an interview Thursday [Dec. 21, 2023] that ‘if Wayfair wants to run a business where people work 80 hours a week, he’s going to have to put up their salaries by 50% to pay them for it,” CNN Business reported.\n\nStory continues\n\n“‘I don’t see this as being successful for the typical employee,’ Bloom said, noting that the jobs market is strong and employees have options.”\n\nAccording to S&P Global Market Intelligence, since Wayfair went public in 2014, on only one occasion did it generate a GAAP profit, which was $185 million in 2020. Overall, it’s lost $4.3 billion in the past decade through Sept. 30, 2023, on many billions in revenue.\n\nWith all the stocks investors can put their money into, I don’t get why anyone would touch Wayfair.\n\nChewy (CHWY) The Chewy logo on a banner at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf the three stocks on my list, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) represents the most significant position in ONLN with a 4.12% weighting. Its shares lost 36% in 2023.\n\nChewy is another pandemic stock that benefited from a surge in companion animals and the purchasing that goes along with pet ownership. It traded upwards of $120 in February 2021. It hit an all-time low of $16.53 in October.\n\nInvestors have since driven the share price higher in the final two months of the year when everything moved higher, and the U.S. market delivered a Q4 2023 return of 12.08%.\n\nChewy is another stock that needs help making money.\n\nIn the five years it’s been a public company – its IPO was June 13, 2019, at $22 a share – the online retailer has a cumulative loss of $637.4 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nIn the 39 weeks ended Oct. 29, 2023, it earned $5.3 million on $8.3 billion in revenue. It’s not a trainwreck like Wayfair, but its net income is still down significantly from the same period in 2022.\n\nAt least in Chewy’s case, it generates positive cash from its operations, which is essential if it wants to stick around.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Gaithersburg MD June 26, 2021 Carvana (CVNA) Auto Dealership\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarvana (NYSE:CVNA) rose from the dead in 2023, gaining 1,117% last year and making some speculators very wealthy. However, the real money was made by those who bought in the March 2020 correction below $30 and sold in August 2021 above $360. I doubt there are many of those folks still around.\n\nInvestors in 2024 will have to decide whether its gains last year were nothing more than a dead cat bounce or something sustainable. I’m going with the former.\n\nTwo things happened in 2023 that helped juice its share price.\n\nFirst, the online buyer and seller of used vehicles restructured about $5.5 billion of its unsecured debt – its maturities stretched from 2025 through 2030 – slashing more than $1.3 billion of its debt and extending maturities out three years to between 2028 and 2031. The move saved $455 million in annual interest expenses in 2024 and 2025.\n\nHowever, as a result of the restructuring, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Carvana’s Issuer credit rating to “D” from “CC” and its senior unsecured debt to “D” from “C.”\n\nThat means that Carvana bought itself some time, but that’s about the extent of it.\n\nThe second benefit was a 70% jump in gross profit per unit in the third quarter to nearly $6,000. As a result, its Q3 2023 gross profit was $482 million, 34% higher than a year earlier, on 18% less revenue.\n\nThat’s some trick. However, most of its pre-tax income in the first nine months of 2023 ($377 million vs. a loss of $1.45 billion a year earlier) is from drastic cuts to its selling, general, and administrative expenses (36% reduction).\n\nCarvana appears to be smoke and mirrors. I’d avoid it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In an era where the market shifts at breakneck speed, millionaire-maker stocks can pop at any minute. Identifying potential investment avenues is critical to navigating a constantly changing landscape.\n\nThese millionaire-maker stocks represent market giants and catalysts reshaping consumer discretionary, technology, finance, and automobile sectors.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has rapidly accumulated over 0.5 billion miles (Q3 2023) driven with the Full Self-Driving beta.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis indicates the company’s significant progress in AI development, which is crucial for achieving full vehicle autonomy.\n\nElon Musk stresses Tesla’s unique method of converting large input data into concise outputs. Tesla can become a leader in self-driving technology with this AI-focused strategy.\n\nTesla completed a 10K GPU cluster of H100s, highlighting their focus on large-scale deployment of advanced computing infrastructure. This technology enables faster production of high-compute units, crucial for training AI models. Implementing this computing infrastructure could give Tesla a competitive edge in self-driving capabilities.\n\nFinally, Tesla deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy storage products in Q3, indicating a substantial increase in its energy division.\n\nTesla’s highest-margin business contributed over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit. Focusing on energy storage aligns with Tesla’s strategy to diversify revenue and meet the demand for sustainable energy solutions and makes TSLA one of the millionaire-maker stocks on the rise.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) staggering surge in operating income by 343% year-over-year is noteworthy (Q3 2023), reflecting effective strategic changes. These changes focused on cost optimizations, operational efficiency enhancements, and strategic investments in high-return areas.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s transition to eight regional fulfillment networks in the U.S. was a major operational change. This change has positively impacted Amazon’s cost-to-serve metrics, customer experiences, and operational efficiency.\n\nOverall, the optimized regional fulfillment clusters, reduced distances, and improved delivery speeds have lowered costs and enhanced customer satisfaction.\n\nThus, focusing on shorter travel distances and fewer touches in the delivery process has helped achieve faster delivery speeds, a crucial factor influencing customer buying behavior.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) robust start to fiscal 2024 (Q1) was underpinned by the exceptional growth in Microsoft Cloud.\n\nThe cloud has recorded quarterly revenue surpassing $31.8 billion, marking a substantial 24% increase. This substantial growth reflects the increasing adoption of Microsoft’s cloud services by businesses worldwide.\n\nThe company’s proactive cloud strategies have resulted in impressive figures.\n\nAzure, Microsoft’s cloud service, is gaining market share as organizations move to the cloud. Additionally, Azure Arc has witnessed a 140% increase in customers, totaling 21K. The company provides services for the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) database, further simplifying customer migration and contributing to Azure’s allure as a preferred cloud provider.\n\nFinally, Microsoft’s focus on consolidating its Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform has attracted significant adoption, with over 73% of the Fortune 1000 currently using three or more data solutions. Lastly, over 16K customers have actively used Microsoft Fabric.\n\nThis includes more than 50% of the Fortune 500, indicating the platform’s efficacy in unifying computing, storage, and governance for analytical purposes. MSFT easily makes any list of millionaire-maker stocks.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) a Google Pixel smartphone\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nYouTube, a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), continues to be a thriving platform for advertising revenue.\n\nThe revenues from YouTube advertising surged to $8 billion, marking a substantial 12% year-on-year growth (Q3 2023). This growth was driven by both brand advertising and direct response initiatives.\n\nThe platform’s broad audience and diverse advertising formats sustain growth. The success of YouTube Shorts and its increasing monetization capabilities, averaging over 70 billion daily views and watched by over 2 billion signed-in users monthly, showcase its potential for revenue expansion.\n\nAlphabet’s diversification strategy is evident in the growth of other revenue streams. Non-advertising revenues from YouTube amount to $8.3 billion and are growing by 21%. This indicates the company’s success in monetizing its subscription services.\n\nFinally, YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium contributed significantly to this revenue stream, highlighting the company’s efforts to create alternative revenue channels beyond advertising.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has a strong liquidity position, and substantial investments are pivotal strengths contributing to its stability and growth potential.\n\nAs of Q3 2023, the company held $152.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bills, with $127.6 billion invested in U.S. Treasury Bills. Additionally, investments in equity and fixed-maturity securities (excluding specific investments) amounted to $341.1 billion.\n\nCash reserves and diversified investments serve multiple purposes. It provides Berkshire Hathaway with liquidity for investments and support during market downturns. The investment portfolio provides protection against market volatility.\n\nOverall, the company’s substantial holdings in U.S. Treasury bills signify a conservative yet secure approach to preserving capital while generating modest returns. Finally, the sizable investments in equity and fixed-maturity securities reflect Berkshire Hathaway’s strategy to deploy capital across various asset classes.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa’s (NYSE:V) establishment of over 500 commercial partnerships with fintechs globally marked a 25% year-over-year increase (Q4 fiscal 2024). This signifies the company’s strategic efforts to collaborate with diverse players in the financial industry.\n\nThese partnerships let Visa access fintech innovation and agility. The company grants startups and established players access to Visa’s network, expertise, and resources.\n\nThis mutually beneficial collaboration fosters the development of innovative payment solutions. Hence, this expands Visa’s market reach and enhances its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving financial technology landscape.\n\nVisa focuses on expanding merchant locations by 17%, particularly in Latin America, Central Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (CEMEA).\n\nThis underscores the company’s focus on broadening its footprint in high-growth markets. Increasing merchant locations facilitates greater consumer access to Visa’s payment services and drives transaction volumes and revenue growth.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lettering on a corporate office in New York City.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nBreaking down JPMorgan Chase’s (NYSE:JPM) performance into segments provides a fundamental perspective on its diversified operations.\n\nFor instance, there is a reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion (Q3 2023). This suggests the strength of this segment in contributing significantly to the company’s overall earnings.\n\nWithin Consumer and Community Banking, Banking & Wealth Management showed a substantial 30% year-on-year revenue increase. This is driven by higher net interest income due to increased rates.\n\nThe end-of-period deposits down 3% quarter-on-quarter might reflect a strategy shift or market trends. However, based on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data, the leadership position in retail deposit share solidifies the company’s market presence and customer trust.\n\nFinally, with revenue up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher NII in Card Services due to increased revolving balances and successful market share recapture in Auto, this segment shows adaptability to market dynamics and customer preferences.\n\nThus, despite some decreases in revenue in home lending, the company maintained a strategic position by capitalizing on specific market trends and positioning itself as one of the millionaire-maker stocks to buy now.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in GOOG.

        "title": "7 Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs) to Supercharge Your Growth in 2024",
        "content": "Dividend reinvesting allows you to receive higher distributions in subsequent quarters and increase your compounding returns. Many investors continue to reinvest their dividend payments until they are ready to live off their dividends and wish to retire.\n\nWhile you can choose from many dividend-paying stocks, some of them are better than others. Finding stocks that combine respectable yields with consistent rate appreciation can result in good long-term returns. Many corporations raise their dividends each year and continue to reward shareholders with buybacks. These are some of the top dividend stocks to consider for reinvestment plans.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) looks like one of the best dividend stocks in the market. The company’s yield is close to 2% and it has been raising the dividend by over 10% each year. Broadcom regularly reports revenue and earnings growth while maintaining profit margins above 35%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe semiconductor giant stands to benefit greatly from artificial intelligence. Although Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) blew Broadcom away in stock gains, it’s been gaining considerable ground since the recent VMware acquisition.\n\nBroadcom shares have more than doubled in the last year and have soared by 342% over the past five years. Broadcom seems destined to become a trillion-dollar company and is about halfway there. Unlike other big tech companies, Broadcom offers a healthy dividend and has consistently hiked it higher over the years.\n\nShares currently trade at a 24 forward P/E ratio. The world’s reliance on chips and Broadcom’s synergies with VMware make it an enticing long-term pick for dividend investors seeking growth.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) was previously flat for multiple years but has surged by 32% year-to-date. That’s still more than 20% removed from its all-time high which the stock can reclaim as data centers gain demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital Realty Trust has a portfolio of over 300 data centers in more than 50 metro areas. The company has over 5,000 customers that use its space for their IT architecture. Companies involved in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and information technology need to invest in data centers like the ones DLR provides.\n\nThe potency of data centers combined with the growth of artificial intelligence contributed to an 18% year-over-year revenue growth rate for the third quarter. The company has formed ventures with GI Partners, TPG Real Estate, and Brookfield Infrastructure among others to expand its portfolio.\n\nDigital Realty Trust has a healthy balance sheet which features almost twice as many total assets as total liabilities. The company’s dividend yield currently sits at 3.60%.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nBig Blue has been staging a comeback after several years of stagnancy for investors which included a lost decade depending on when you bought shares. Looking in the present, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has gained 16% year-to-date and is up by 52% over the past five years.\n\nThe turnaround is fueled by strategic acquisitions of companies like Red Hat along with artificial intelligence. Revenue only goes up by single digits while profit margins have been expanding nicely. The company reported 5% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and more than doubled its net income.\n\nAlthough IBM has staged good growth in recent quarters, it is still a mature company. Investors get to enjoy a dividend yield above 4%, but dividend growth is minimal. In 2023, the company hiked its quarterly dividend from $1.65 per share to $1.66 per share. That’s less than a 1% year-over-year increase for the dividend, and IBM has been hiking the dividend by only $0.01 per share since 2020.\n\nGrowing profits and top-line expansion can help the company raise its quarterly dividend by more than $0.01 per share each year. However, investors should view it as a blue-chip stock that offers more safety and a higher yield than other tech companies.\n\nStag Industrial (STAG)  stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes D\n\nSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com\n\nStag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) has a real estate portfolio of warehouses and storage facilities. The company has 568 properties encompassing 112 million square feet in 41 states. The company has a star-studded list of clients that include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) among others.\n\nInvestors get to enjoy a 3.75% dividend yield and monthly dividend distributions. While you can get monthly dividends by investing in enough companies, some stocks like STAG make it easy to receive frequent payouts. The company recently raised its monthly dividend from $0.121667 per share to $0.1225 per share. The annual dividend currently comes to $1.47 per share. Last year, it was at $1.46 per share.\n\nInvestors should approach Stag Industrial with the same dividend growth expectations as IBM. You won’t get much dividend growth but get a high yield from a stable company. Shares have gained 22% year-to-date and are up by 60% over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has the lowest dividend yield out of the stocks on this list but it makes up for it in every other way. It’s easy to overlook the 0.80% dividend yield when shares have gained 57% year-to-date and are up by 275% over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft got its start with personal computers but rapidly expanded into other markets, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, social media through LinkedIn, and gaming. AI Copilots has many investors excited as this artificial intelligence bot will enhance the experience for Microsoft Office products. The technology was enough for Daniel Ives to raise his price target to $450. That price hike implies a 19.7% upside.\n\nInvestors should monitor how the copyright infringement battle plays out between The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) and Microsoft over its artificial intelligence tools.

The company’s technology helps corporations become more efficient, achieve lower costs and minimize the risk of cyberattacks.\n\nOracle also offers advertising solutions, customer relationship management software, workforce management tools, and other resources. The company has a 1.50% dividend yield and recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.32 per share to $0.40 per share. It’s a 25% increase. Oracle currently has a dividend schedule that indicates one increase every two years.\n\nOracle posted $12.9 billion in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. It’s a 5% year-over-year improvement but growth in the company’s cloud segments indicates more promise. Cloud revenue makes up more than a third of the company’s total revenue and increased by 25% year-over-year.\n\nCloud Infrastructure revenue was the biggest winner with 52% year-over-year growth. That segment makes up more than 10% of the company’s total revenue. During remarks about the earnings report, Oracle CEO Safra Catz expressed optimism about surging demand for cloud infrastructure and generative AI services.\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a mature big tech company that has a market cap of just over $200 billion. The company’s 15 P/E ratio offers reasonable safety compared to other stocks in the industry. Dividend investors get to enjoy a 3% dividend yield but the annual dividend growth rate is in the low single digits.\n\nCisco stock is another case of taking a relatively low risk with limited upside for a respectable yield. The stock has gained 5% year-to-date and is up by 18% over the past five years. Cisco has been acquiring companies to bolster growth and tap into the cloud. The recent acquisition of Isovalent and the headline-grabbing acquisition of Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) indicate the company is exploring opportunities for growth.\n\nCloud computing presents an attractive growth opportunity and can help Cisco achieve enticing revenue and earnings growth in the future. Revenue growth is in the high single digits to low double digits while net income continues to expand rapidly.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AVGO and MSFT.

        "title": "Institutional investors may overlook Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) recent US$76b market cap drop as long-term gains remain positive",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Amazon.com implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 25 shareholders own 47% of the company Insiders own 12% of Amazon.com\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 61% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nNo shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 4.9% in value last week. However, the 68% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amazon.com, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amazon.com?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Amazon.com does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amazon.com, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nStory continues earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amazon.com. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Jeffrey Bezos (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 9.6% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 5.9% of the stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Amazon.com\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Amazon.com, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$182b stake in this US$1.5t business. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Amazon.com. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Amazon.com better, we need to consider many other factors.\n\nMany find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "2 FAANG Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Over multidecade periods, Wall Street has proved to be a bona fide wealth-creating machine. But over shorter timelines, such as a few months or a couple of years, directional moves in the major stock indexes can be unpredictable.\n\nFor the past decade, when the going has gotten tough on Wall Street, investors have turned to the time-tested FAANG stocks.\n\nBy \"FAANG,\" I'm talking about:\n\nFacebook, which is now a subsidiary of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from absolutely crushing the broader market in the return department over the trailing decade, these five companies dominate their respective industries.\n\nMeta Platforms owns some of the top social media \"real estate\" on the planet and attracted nearly 4 billion active users to its sites each month during the September-ended quarter. Apple's iPhone accounts for better than 50% of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, its share repurchase program over the past decade is unmatched by any public company. Nearly 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022 can be traced to Amazon's online marketplace. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is also the world's top cloud infrastructure service provider by spending. Netflix is both the domestic and international market share leader in streaming services. Further, no streaming company comes close to matching its library of original content. Alphabet's Google is pretty much a monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in December.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the FAANGs could differ dramatically in the new year. While two of these outperformers remain historically inexpensive and are ripe for the picking, another industry leader has seen its growth engine stall.\n\nFAANG stock No. 1 to buy hand over fist in 2024: Meta Platforms\n\nDespite shares nearly tripling in 2023, social media stock Meta Platforms stands out as a clear-cut value play in the new year (and beyond).\n\nStory continues\n\nArguably, the biggest risk for Meta is the possibility of the U.S. falling into a recession in 2024. A couple of money-focused metrics and forecasting tools with exemplary track records do suggest a challenging year lies ahead. Since Meta generates more than 98% of its revenue from advertising and businesses are typically quick to pare back their ad spending in a weakening economy, this would be bad news for the company.\n\nThe thing about recessions that's often overlooked is just how short-lived they typically are. Nine of the 12 recessions following World War II haven't lasted a year, while none of the remaining three made it past 18 months. By comparison, there have been two economic expansions that endured at least a full decade since 1945. More often than not, ad-driven companies are enjoying a favorable economic climate.\n\nWhat really puts the ball in Meta's court is its aforementioned social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site globally, while Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are, collectively, among the most-downloaded apps worldwide. In spite of seemingly endless competition, Meta's social media apps continue to shine and draw in a greater number of monthly active users. That's great news for its ad-pricing power.\n\nInvestors should also consider that Meta's mammoth operating cash flow and cash-rich balance sheet give it the luxury of investing in high-growth initiatives. Though its augmented/virtual reality segment, Reality Labs, has lost nearly $11.5 billion through the first nine months of 2023, its family of apps has generated $41.8 billion in profit. Meta is also sitting on more than $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. CEO Mark Zuckerberg can make investments for the future without hurting his company's bread-and-butter operating segment.\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms remains historically cheap after its big run-up. Shares can be purchased for 11.8 times forward-year cash flow, which is 25% below Meta's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing five years.\n\nFAANG stock No. 2 to buy hand over fist in 2024: Alphabet\n\nThe other FAANG stock investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024 is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nNot to sound like a broken record, but Alphabet shares the same biggest concern as Meta Platforms: a potential slowdown in advertising. Alphabet brought in about 78% of its revenue during the third quarter from advertising. If the U.S. economy slows down in the new year, it's probable that businesses would taper their ad spending -- at least in the short run.\n\nWhat Alphabet has working in its favor is its practical monopoly status in global internet search. According to monthly search share data provided by GlobalStats, the last time Google closed out a month with less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search was March 2015. It's the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to reach consumers, which should propel strong ad-pricing power for parent company Alphabet.\n\nHowever, it's the company's ancillary operating segments that represent its most-intriguing growth prospects in 2024 (and beyond). In particular, cloud infrastructure service provider Google Cloud has turned the corner to recurring profitability. Enterprise cloud spending has a long growth runway, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, as of the September-ended quarter.\n\nYouTube is no slouch, either. It's attracting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, which trails only Facebook, and has seen daily views of Shorts (short-form videos that typically last less than a minute) shoot past 50 billion. Both premium subscriptions and advertising demand should increase in the new year.\n\nBest of all, Alphabet remains inexpensive. Shares can be purchased for 14.4 times forward-year cash flow to begin 2024. That's a notable discount to its average cash flow multiple of 18 over the previous five years. Image source: Apple.\n\nThe FAANG stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Apple\n\nUnfortunately, not every FAANG stock is poised to be a winner in 2024. Although tech stock Apple has been one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the past 20 years, it's not a company I'd suggest putting money to work in this year.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- Apple is a pretty phenomenal business. As noted, it accounts for half or more of U.S. smartphone market share. Further, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the evolution of Apple into a platforms-focused company. An operating model that emphasizes subscription services should lift Apple's operating margin over time, as well as alleviate some of the wild revenue swings that usually accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nBut it's not about where Apple has been so much as where it's going. Right now, Apple isn't going anywhere. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple reported an $11 billion (2.8%) year-over-year decline in sales. Though its services segment generated 9% sales growth for the fiscal year, every physical product division saw sales decline -- iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Wearables.\n\nWhat makes this underperformance even more eye-popping is that it occurred with above-average inflation as a tailwind. Apple is one of the best-known and most-trusted brands on the planet. The fact that it wasn't able to raise its prices enough to lift its sales with above-average inflation demonstrates how weak organic demand was for its physical products in fiscal 2023.\n\nTo add to this, while Apple was able to avoid a decline in year-over-year earnings per share thanks to its incredible share repurchase program, net income did decline from $99.8 billion to $97 billion. In other words, buybacks appear to be the only thing really saving Apple stock from a meltdown at this point.\n\nHistorically, investors have had no qualms paying an aggressive multiple to own shares of Apple if the company is growing by a double-digit rate. But with a negative real-growth rate, Apple stock is highly unattractive at 27 times forward-year earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "4 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in 2024",
        "content": "For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been putting on a clinic for Wall Street and everyday investors. Since taking the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an aggregate return of 4,384,747% in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) as of the end of 2023. On an annualized basis, he's practically doubled the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 since becoming CEO.\n\nRiding the Oracle of Omaha's coattails is a strategy that's made patient investors significantly richer over the years. The struggle is simply deciding which of Berkshire's approximately 50 different securities to buy.\n\nAs we open the curtain on a new year, four Warren Buffett stocks stand out as screaming buys. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nMastercard\n\nThe first phenomenal buy you'll find in the $368 billion portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is none other than payment processor Mastercard(NYSE: MA).\n\nThe single biggest headwind for a cyclical juggernaut like Mastercard is the health of the U.S. and global economy. If a recession were to take shape, consumer and enterprise spending would be expected to decline. That's not particularly good news for a company that relies on growth in aggregate transactions and total payment volume.\n\nHowever, perspective changes everything. Even though recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, they're typically short-lived. While no recession following World War II has surpassed 18 months, the majority of expansions have endured multiple years, with two lasting a full decade. Cyclical companies like Mastercard spend very little time navigating choppy waters.\n\nMastercard's success is also a function of its lending avoidance. Though the company would likely be successful as a lender, entering the lending market would potentially expose it to loan losses during recessions. With management sticking to high-margin and predictable payment processing, Mastercard hasn't been hamstrung by economic downturns.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, consider the opportunity that lies ahead for Mastercard. Most emerging market regions remain underbanked (e.g., Southeastern Asia, Africa, and the Middle East), while cashless transaction adoption continues to grow in developed countries. Expect Mastercard stock to climb to a fresh all-time high in 2024.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nA second Warren Buffett stock that makes for a screaming buy in the new year is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). Shares of Sirius XM were recently re-added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio following a roughly two-year absence.\n\nOne of the clearest advantages Sirius XM brings to the table is its legal monopoly status. Although it faces competition for listeners from terrestrial and online radio operators, there isn't another licensed satellite-radio operator. This affords the company exceptional subscription-pricing power.\n\nAnother reason patient investors can trust Sirius XM to deliver is its revenue diversity. Most radio operators are heavily reliant on advertising for the lion's share of their sales. The problem with advertising is that its highly cyclical. The slightest hint of trouble is often enough to convince companies to pare back their ad spending.\n\nThrough the first nine months of 2023, Sirius XM generated just 19% of its $6.67 billion in total sales from advertising, most of which originated from Pandora, which it acquired in 2019. Meanwhile, 77% of its revenue derived from subscriptions. During recessions, subscribers are far less likely to cancel than advertisers are to reduce their spending. Thus, Sirius XM is far better prepared to navigate a downturn than its peers.\n\nFurthermore, some of the company's costs remain relatively fixed. While talent acquisition and royalty expenses are going to vary from quarter to quarter, transmission and equipment expenses don't change much, if at all. As Sirius XM adds new subscribers, its operating margin can steadily expand. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nParamount Global\n\nMedia juggernaut Paramount Global(NASDAQ: PARA) is the third Warren Buffett stock that looks like an amazing buy for 2024.\n\nLast year was something of a double whammy for Paramount. Rapidly rising interest rates were a clear concern for investors given Paramount's debt-heavy balance sheet. Meanwhile, advertising revenue took a dive, with many businesses anticipating a recession. Advertising accounted for nearly 40% of Paramount's legacy TV media division sales through the first nine months of 2023.\n\nThankfully, the new year brings new opportunities. Specifically, 2024 is an election year. According to advertising company GroupM, U.S. political advertising is expected to grow to nearly $16 billion in the new year. This would represent an increase of 31% from the 2020 election cycle, and it's the perfect spark for ad-driven businesses.\n\nInvestors should also be excited about the future growth potential of Paramount's streaming segment. Even following price hikes for Paramount+ and ad-supported tier subscriptions in June, the subscriber base for Paramount+ has continued to expand. When coupled with mindful cost-reduction efforts, Paramount's direct-to-consumer segment should deliver notably smaller losses in 2024.\n\nDon't forget about Pluto TV, either. Pluto TV is the nation's leading free, ad-supported streaming service. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, people could look to cut their monthly expenses by choosing a free, ad-driven service like Pluto TV.\n\nParamount's track record of profitability makes its latest swoon a buying opportunity for value seekers.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe fourth and final Warren Buffett stock that makes for a screaming buy in 2024 is the leading e-commerce company, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its online marketplace. Insider Intelligence estimated that Amazon would rake in nearly $0.40 of every $1 spent in U.S. online retail sales in 2022. But while a majority of the company's sales originate from its online marketplace, very little of its operating cash flow or profit come from e-commerce.\n\nThree ancillary segments are the secret sauce that make Amazon tick. Leading the charge is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's top cloud infrastructure service provider. Enterprise cloud spending is still early in its ramp-up, which should allow AWS to enjoy sustained double-digit increases in year-over-year sales. AWS is regularly responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income despite accounting for just one-sixth of the company's net sales.\n\nAdvertising services is the second key division that continues to thrive. Amazon attracts more than 2 billion users to its site on a monthly basis, which makes it a logical go-to for merchants wanting to get their product(s) or message(s) in front of motivated shoppers. Even amid a challenging climate for advertisers, Amazon hasn't had any trouble sustaining double-digit sales growth.\n\nThe third segment of importance for Amazon is subscription services. According to founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021. It's likely added even more Prime subscribers since becoming the exclusive home for Thursday Night Football.\n\nAlthough Amazon wouldn't be considered inexpensive by traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's cheaper than it's ever been relative to its forward-year cash flow. This makes it a stellar buy as we push forward into a new year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Megatrends will continue to develop, creating incredible opportunities. Here are seven of the top megatrend stocks that are capitalizing on one or more powerful trends you shouldn’t avoid. I’ll be talking about fintech, e-commerce, emerging economies, the rise of India, and the true beginning of the metaverse. That’s not an exhaustive list of current megatrend stocks, but it’s a good start.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top megatrend stocks to consider is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). As one of the fastest-growing e-commerce companies in the world, it’s been compared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The only difference is that MELI serves the Latin American market. So, right off the bat, MercadoLibre touches on e-commerce, fintech, and rising interest in emerging economies.\n\nThe primary reason an investor should consider investing in any company is for its fundamentals. Fortunately, Mercado Libre is very strong fundamentally. The growth metrics underpinning the firm are very, very strong. For example, in the third quarter, revenues increased by 69.1% reaching $3.8 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTotal payment volume grew by 121.3%, growing to $47.3 billion. In addition, it’s abundantly clear that MercadoLibre’s fintech payments system, Mercado Pago, is growing incredibly fast.\n\nSify Technologies (SIFY) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nNext up is Sify Technologies (NASDAQ:SIFY). The reason I wanted to focus on Sify is that India is becoming much more important to the global economy. The country is one of the fastest growing in the world, clocking an annual GDP growth rate of 5.5%. Better, India is expected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2027.\n\nThe company grew by 11% in the most recent quarter and continues to be profitable, although decreasingly so. India continues to be noted for its burgeoning IT sector. So investors should expect companies like Sify Technologies to increasingly gain exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a big year for megatrend stocks, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). For one, Apple is set to release its Vision Pro augmented/virtual reality headset in late January or early February.  The first wave of Vision Pros should be shipped in about a month. It’s also expected that the company will ship roughly 500,000 headsets in 2024.\n\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, isn’t expected to have a large impact on Apple financially. Remember, Apple sells roughly 200 million iPhones per year so the Vision Pro isn’t particularly important from a fiscal perspective. However, it is important in that it will propel Apple farther into the metaverse. It simply gives investors another reason to consider Apple which has a track record of releasing viral products that the world is very quick to adopt en masse.\n\nGrab Holdings (GRAB) Motorcycle helmet with Grab logo on a motorcycle parked at the road side\n\nSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) is a mega app serving a diverse base of customers across a handful of emerging Southeast Asian growth economies. The stock hits on a few important megatrends, specifically the emergence of Southeast Asia and emerging technologies overall.\n\nWhen I say emerging technologies, I’m referring to Grab Holdings and its development of a super app that places a huge variety of services at users’ fingertips. The company’s app allows a user to hail a taxi, get food delivered, pay for services, get insurance, and access telemedicine among other things.\n\nInvestors continue to be interested in Grab Holdings because the company is located in Singapore, one of the world’s great financial hubs. further, Singapore is centrally located and provides close access to burgeoning Southeast Asian economies that continue to gain attention. As the world’s mega powers continue to deal with difficulties of their own investors are increasingly looking to untapped markets to satisfy their desire for growth. Southeast Asia is full of such potential.\n\n2024 is going to be marked by quantitative easing which will make Grab Holdings’ losses look less important and its 61% revenue growth look that much more attractive.\n\nAdyen (ADYEY) undervalued fintech stocks A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word \"Fintech,\" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth. Fintech Stock Bargains, fintech stock\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdyen (OTCMKTS:ADYEY) Is a leading fintech stock and a company capitalizing on a global shift in payments. It’s another one of the top megatrend stocks you may want to consider.\n\nBrick-and-mortar retail is fading as e-commerce continues to grow. Likewise, cash is beginning to take a back seat to digitized payments. These shifts are broadly called fintech which is the emergence of new payment systems.\n\nAdd Yin is also one of the leading firms in the unified payments space. The unified payments space refers to the idea that all of your various digital payments can be unified into a single swipe, for example. The company saw a 25% increase in its unified payments volume in the third quarter. Revenues increased by 22%, reaching 413.6 million euros.\n\nA report from McKinsey pegged fintech growth between 2022 and 2028 at 15% annually. The payment space will continue to provide strong growth opportunities for investors in the years to come.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, take a look at megatrend stocks, like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which is set to capitalize on the long arc of metaverse development. The company famously changed its stock name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in late 2021 signaling a larger shift.\n\nThen things rapidly unraveled as the realities of 2022 set in. The era of pandemic largess, stimulus payments, and runaway inflation was over. A period of fiscal conservatism marked by a series of rapid decreases in the federal funds rate resulted in a rapid decline in the company’s share price.\n\nTo be clear, Meta Platforms 2022 troubles were a consequence of declining ad revenues much more than its choice to rebrand. Ad revenues from its family of apps segment continue to drive the business and its results. So, META stock is more a macroeconomic story than it is a metaverse story if you follow my message. Revenues are again strong as the economy continues to show signs of strength, resulting in 23% top line growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to run the advertising that shows real utilitarian development of its metaphors applications. The company is in position to see some real returns from what once looked like a crazy investment.\n\nFiverr (FVRR) The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: Temitiman / Shutterstock.com\n\nFiverr (NYSE:FVRR) is a solid stock to consider for investors looking to capitalize on seismic shifts in labor. The company has successfully developed an e-commerce platform that allows freelancers to sell their services efficiently.\n\nThe result is that today the company sees more than 92 million in quarterly revenues which translates to a moderate growth rate. more importantly, it’s a well-established, stabilizing firm overall. Of course, Fiverr benefits from the continued growth in freelance work and the movement away from traditional employment. What’s particularly important to note about the company from a fundamental perspective is that it is rapidly approaching profitability.\n\nThe company did produce a moderate net income of $3.03 million in Q3. Its net loss through the first nine months of 2023 declined from more than $70 million to just above $1 million. As more and more people shun the traditional work environment and Fiverr marches toward increasing profitability, expect its share price to rise.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Emerging Market Watch: 3 International Stocks to Soar in 2024",
        "content": "While Warren Buffett’s piece of wisdom – to paraphrase, don’t bet against America – has proven sound, investors looking ahead may want to consider emerging markets stocks. As the phrase implies, we’re talking about economies still in their growth phase. That contrasts with the U.S., which stands in more of a maturity cycle.\n\nFundamentally, emerging markets stocks appeal to more risk-tolerant investors due to their potentially greater upside prospects. Nothing is guaranteed, to be clear. However, when you’re dealing with a broad canvas that is growing at a healthy clip, it’s more than possible that this momentum rubs off to downstream players. By getting onboard earlier, you might be able to catch a profitable wave.\n\nOn the flipside, the sector carries risks. For example, some experts see lower inflation undergirding a bullish narrative for emerging markets stocks. Other experts believe that such names may have difficulties dealing with rising prices. Again, much of your decision hinges on your risk tolerance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, if you’re willing to accept a little heat in the kitchen, the emerging markets stocks below could be viable.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn Argentine company headquartered in Montevideo, Uruguay, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) operates online marketplaces dedicated to e-commerce and online auctions. Primarily, the company is attractive for possibly becoming the online retail north star of Latin America. Analysts are certainly hopeful, rating shares a strong buy with an average price target of $1,750.50. That implies about 17% upside potential.\n\nWhile trading mostly occurred within a sideways pattern in 2023, MELI broke out in the last few weeks. In the trailing year, shares gained over 79% of equity value. One key catalyst is surprisingly Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). While the e-commerce juggernaut has blown out the competition in the U.S., it struggles to compete in Latin America. That may give an “in” for MercadoLibre, which might be able to challenge Amazon’s hegemony.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, MELI offers a tremendous three-year revenue growth rate of 63.3%. Also, its trailing-year operating and net margins are among the best in the business. It also trades at a discounted price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.63X. Overall, it’s one of the emerging markets stocks to consider.\n\nTencent (TCEHY)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA Chinese multinational technology conglomerate, Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) may be traded over the counter here in the U.S. But don’t let that fool you. Per its public profile, Tencent is one of the highest-grossing multimedia companies in the world based on revenue. Wall Street analysts are certainly not shying away from the opportunity, pegging shares a moderate buy. Also, the price target stands at $52.14, implying almost 35% upside potential.\n\nFundamentally, the narrative surrounding Tencent focuses on the underlying Chinese digital media market. Per Statista, experts project that the sector will generate revenue of $135.7 billion by the end of this year. Further, under this broad umbrella, the video games subsegment represents the largest, projected to hit market volume of $94.49 billion. Factor in other components of China’s internet economy and TCEHY could surprise folks.\n\nNow, the risk factor obviously centers on China’s economic growth overall. Some data offers encouragement but it’s up in the air. But if you’re willing to take the risk, TCEHY trades at a discounted forward earnings multiple of 13.83X. Thus, it offers an enticing idea for emerging markets stocks.\n\nSea (SE) The logo for Sea Limited is seen on a web browser through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn enticing albeit super-risky idea for emerging markets stocks, Sea (NYSE:SE) is only appropriate for speculators. Either that or patient investors that have a high tolerance for risk. A technology conglomerate, Sea offers three business units: digital entertainment (via the Garena gaming arm), e-commerce (via the Shopee platform), and digital financial services (via ShopeePay).\n\nHere’s the deal. Last year, SE did not perform to expectations. In the trailing 52 weeks, shares lost more than 30% of equity value. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about the company, rating SE a moderate buy with a $54.52 price target. That implies an upside potential of almost 41%. Further, the high-side target lands at $80, implying more than double the time-of-writing stock price.\n\nFundamentally, much of the actual bullishness may depend on projections for the Southeast Asia internet economy. Per World Economic Forum, it’s possible for the region to reach $1 trillion in gross merchandise value by 2030.\n\nAgain, it’s super-risky and with a forward earnings multiple of 33.78X, it ain’t cheap. However, the company enjoys a massive three-year revenue growth rate of 64.8%. If you want emerging growth, this might be it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock lost ground in Thursday's trading. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant's share price closed out the daily session down 2.6%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAmazon stock pulled back today following a report from Bloomberg that TikTok is planning on entering the e-commerce market. Wall Street is showing some concern that an innovative competitor could pressure the reigning online retail giant.\n\nWhat would competition from TikTok mean for Amazon?\n\nTikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has a massive and highly engaged global user base -- and it could make waves in industries outside of its core social-media operations. Exactly what tack ByteDance and TikTok might take to enter and expand in the e-commerce market remains to be seen.\n\nBuilding out a warehousing and distribution network would be difficult and costly. Building infrastructure that could rival Amazon's would be even more challenging. TikTok could accelerate its entry into the market with acquisitions or partnerships, but it's far too early to suggest that it's poised to disrupt Amazon in the category.\n\nIs Amazon stock a buy for 2024?\n\nEven with indications that TikTok could enter the e-commerce market, Amazon still looks like a smart buy for 2024.\n\nWhile Amazon generates the large majority of its revenue from its e-commerce business, it actually generates the large majority of its profits from its cloud infrastructure business. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is facing increasing competition from companies including Microsoft and Alphabet, but it remains top dog in the cloud market.\n\nCrucially, the space continues to grow and is big enough to support multiple winners, and Amazon is poised to score ongoing wins as the cloud services industry continues to expand. With new artificial intelligence applications being developed, launched, and scaled on the company's cloud infrastructure, AWS stands to enjoy strong demand tailwinds through the next decade and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the company's e-commerce business could benefit from AI trends. With computing breakthroughs opening the door for increased factory and delivery automation, Amazon could see margins for its online retail business improve significantly.\n\nAmazon remains one of the world's best-run companies, and it has an excellent track record when it comes to innovating and fending off competitors. With AI and other potential catalysts creating new growth opportunities, building a long-term position in the stock continues to look like a smart move.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Amazon.com Inc.’s share of online orders spiked in the final days of the holiday shopping season, demonstrating how big investments in delivery speed paid off with procrastinating shoppers looking for a wide selection of products they could get quickly.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIslamic State Claims Responsibility for Deadly Iran Blasts Confidential Jeffrey Epstein Documents Unsealed by New York Court Just a Billion Doesn't Cut It on This Exclusive Florida Island Deadly Iran Blasts and Red Sea Warnings Fan Mideast Tensions Fed Sees Rates Staying High for Some Time With Cuts Eyed in 2024\n\nAmazon captured 29% of global order volume in the final two weeks before Christmas, up from 21% the week of Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Route, a package-tracking app that captured holiday season data from 55 million orders.\n\n“It’s a pretty sharp shift in how consumers shop,” said Michael Yamartino, Route’s chief executive officer. “The top priority in the days leading up to Christmas is on-time delivery, and when Amazon says it will take two days, it only takes two days. It’s a combination of speed and confidence.”\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has touted speedy delivery as a key competitive advantage, saying shoppers are more inclined to buy something if they get it quickly. The company’s logistics prowess has become increasingly important amid rising competition from such stalwarts as Walmart Inc., as well as Chinese e-commerce upstarts like Temu, Shein and TikTok, which offer steep discounts but can take a week or more to deliver packages.\n\nAmazon in July announced plans to double the number of same-day delivery facilities in the coming years. The company said it reached its fastest-ever delivery speeds in the second quarter of 2023. Amazon currently operates more than 50 US same-day facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, Boston and other big metro areas that ship about 200 million packages a year, according to MWPVL International Inc., which monitors the company’s delivery operation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s fastest deliveries mostly benefit members of its Prime subscription program. About 70% of Prime orders in the US arrive within two days, and almost one in four are delivered within a day, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Fewer than 15% of orders arrive that quickly for shoppers without Prime subscriptions, the Chicago-based firm said.\n\n—With assistance from Matt Day.\n\n(Company corrected timing of delivery speed milestone in penultimate paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy America’s Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs These Are the Five Potential Trouble Spots That Could Knock the Global Economy Off Course Help, I Saw My Boss on a Dating Site Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?

        "content": "Scores of Americans had to brush up their CVs last year.\n\nIn 2023, companies planned 721,677 job cuts,a 98% jump from 2022, according to a new report from professional outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. The numbermarks the highest annual total since 2020.\n\nThe year included several high-profile tech layoffs from names like Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN), who expanded during the earlier stages of the pandemic only to slash jobs later. Mark Zuckerberg even referred to 2023 as Meta's \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nWhile companies including Spotify, Hasbro, Amazon, and Citigroup laid off employees last holiday season, the Challenger report showed that the biggest increases in job cuts last year took place in the first half of 2023.\n\n“Layoffs have begun to level off, and hiring has remained steady as we end 2023. That said, labor costs are high,” said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, said in the report. “Employers are still extremely cautious and in cost-cutting mode heading into 2024, so the hiring process will likely slow for many job seekers and cuts will continue in Q1, though at a slower pace.”\n\nThe tech industry led the country in the job cuts with a 73% increase last year to168,032. That’s just shy of the annual record of 168,395 cuts in tech in 2001.\n\n“The Tech sector will continue to be impacted by the onset of AI, mergers and acquisitions, and realigning of resources and talent,” Challenger added in the report.\n\nIn second place came the retail industry with 78,840 job cuts, a 274% increase from the previous year. Healthcare and financial employers came in third and fourth place, respectively. Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 Meta's \"year of efficiency.\" (Nick Wass/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“While there is a lot of hiring happening in healthcare, we've also seen a lot of turnover there, some more volatility than most industries,” Challenger told Yahoo Finance in an interview earlier this week. “Because like technology, and like finance, those were areas that really spiked and had to come back down to Earth with the changes that were happening in the post-COVID period.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to the rise in layoffs, other signs have appeared showing that the labor market is cooling. A survey from Challenger released last month showed that 34% of employers didn’t give out bonuses in 2023 up from the 27% that didn’t award company bonuses in 2022 and the highest rate since 2019, when 36% of companies decided not to give their workers bonuses.\n\nA separate report by ADP released Thursday showed that while job gains rose for the fourth straight month in December, pay growth for people who stayed in their jobs slowed from the previous month.\n\nDylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Certain stocks seem to get all the attention in the media and online message boards. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) anyone?\n\nThis is a shame because in reality, hundreds of stocks quietly outperform the market on a consistent basis without getting much analyst mention. The reasons for the oversight are many.\n\nThe media and online peanut galleries tend to focus on large cap stocks, companies that are household names, and shares that are widely held. Also, stocks with unusual and big price movements tend to attract the spotlight. Smaller stocks of Steady Eddie companies whose share prices rise consistently over time tend to largely fly under the radar or get drowned out by the noise.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd yet, it is worth it for investors to find these compounders. Let’s look at the stealth wealth portfolio including three stocks of consistency and value.\n\nU-Haul Holding Co. (UHAL) U-Haul van driving on a street in downtown San Francisco\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust how unnoticed is U-Haul Holding Co. (NYSE:UHAL)? Only one analyst offers a price target on the stock.\n\nThis is a bit surprising given that U-Haul is a well-known national brand. In business continuously for nearly 80 years, it has annual revenues over $4.5 billion. However, the lack of attention on Wall Street hasn’t seemed to hurt UHAL stock. Over the past 12 months, the share price has gained 16%, and it is up 105% over the last five years. The stock has more than tripled since 2014.\n\nWhile U-Haul’s do-it-yourself moving business isn’t high-tech or sexy, the company dominates the industry in the U.S. and Canada with 23,000 locations and nearly 200,000 rental trucks. It’s the type of business that could do extremely well as interest rates come down and the economy strengthens. Also, UHAL, which continues to be run by the founding Shoen family, is expanding in the self-storage business.\n\nBarron’s magazine named UHAL one of its top picks for 2024, noting the attractive valuation. And analysts say the company would make a great acquisition target for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B).\n\nStory continues\n\nThomson Reuters (TRI) newspapers folded and arranged in row like books on a shelf. gray background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) is a media company worthy of some headlines. It’s true that newspapers around the world continue to close due to lack of advertising and subscription revenue. But, TRI’s newswire service is becoming increasingly necessary and dominant around the world.\n\nAs a result, the company continues to issue strong earnings reports, and its stock is trading near an all-time high. All while flying largely under the radar of the financial press of which it is a part.\n\nFurther, the stock is up 20% over the last 12 months and has gained nearly 200% in the past five years. In November, the company reported a third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ forecasts. Thomson Reuters announced earnings per share (EPS) of 82 cents, well above analysts’ forecasts of 71 cents. Revenue grew 1% in Q3 to $1.59 billion, which was slightly below consensus forecasts of $1.61 billion.\n\nYet, revenue in the company’s news division rose 3% driven by growth in digital advertising. Additionally, Thomson Reuters announced plans to spend $10 billion to bolster its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nMove over Nike (NYSE:NKE), there’s a new running shoe king in town. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) continues to run hot due to exceptional earnings driven by sales of its increasingly popular Hoka running shoes.\n\nIn the last 12 months, DECK stock has risen 73%, bringing its five year gains to 452%. Compare that performance to the stock of Nike, down 12% in the last year and up only 40% since 2019. And yet, Deckers Outdoor continues to fly under the radar.\n\nThe stealthy outperformance of DECK stock comes as the company, which also makes Teva sandals and Ugg boots, issues stellar quarterly earnings. The company reported Q3 EPS of $6.82, which was well ahead of the $4.40 forecast on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter rose 25% year over year (YOY) to $1.09 billion, which topped the consensus estimate of $960.62 million. Also, Deckers report that its direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales grew 38.8% to $331.7 million, while its wholesale sales rose 19.4% during Q3.\n\nThis is a best-in-class shoe company that has also quietly become a major growth security despite being a stock flying under the radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in DECK.

        "content": "Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) tumbled 3% out of the gate Thursday, before clawing back half their losses later in the morning. As of 10:30 a.m. ET, Amazon stock remains down 1.5%.\n\nYou can blame TikTok for that.\n\nTikTok could threaten Amazon's e-commerce business\n\nTikTok parent company ByteDance Ltd., you see, is starting to horn in on Amazon's dominant e-commerce business in the U.S., as reported on Bloomberg last night. TikTok currently sells less than $2 billion per year in merchandise in the U.S. -- a tiny fraction of Amazon's $554 billion in annual sales. But TikTok aims to grow its e-commerce business \"tenfold,\" according to the news agency.\n\nPlacing ads on scrollers' feeds to encourage \"impulse buying\" could lift TikTok to $17.5 billion in sales in 2024. And granted, even hitting that number would mean TikTok's e-commerce business is only 3% the size of Amazon's. But it would also mean TikTok is growing at 1,000% per year. Meanwhile, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Amazon's sales averaged only 20% growth over the last five years.\n\nThat's how tiny TikTok might pose a real danger to Amazon's e-commerce business.\n\nNot so fast, Tex\n\nAnd yet ... is this story even true? Buried deep within Bloomberg's article is a disclaimer from TikTok itself, which states: \"The speculated U.S. merchandise sales figures represented by Bloomberg are inaccurate.\"\n\nAnd yet, TikTok didn't clarify how inaccurate Bloomberg's report was -- whether Bloomberg had misplaced a decimal, for example, or was entirely wrong about TikTok's plans to sell stuff in the U.S., or somewhere in between. So there seems to be some confusion here about exactly how big a threat TikTok poses to Amazon.\n\nWhat is clear is that \"TikTok Shop is one of the fastest-growing features for the Beijing-based, closely held company,\" says Bloomberg, and that it has helped ByteDance grow into a powerful force in social media, with $200 billion in market cap and $110 billion in annual sales from all sources -- sales growing at 30% per year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo maybe TikTok's not growing 50 times faster than Amazon, but it's still growing faster than Amazon, period. And with TikTok Shop apparently charging commissions on its sales that are barely half of what Amazon charges its Marketplace customers, chances are good that TikTok Shop is only going to get bigger in the future.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos Encouraged His Brother And Sister To Invest $10,000 In Amazon — Their Stake Grew 10,249,900% And Now Potentially Is Worth Over $1 Billion",
        "content": "In the mid-1990s, a $10,000 investment in a nascent online bookstore seemed risky, but for Jeff Bezos's siblings Mark and Christina, the decision may have catapulted them into the ranks of billionaires. A Bloomberg report reveals that in 1996, they each purchased 30,000 Amazon.com Inc. shares for $10,000. This investment has since grown exponentially, with each sibling’s stake potentially reaching over $1 billion today, a 10,249,900% gain.\n\nAccording to an article by Luxury Launches, referencing a Bloomberg report from July 31, 2018, the stakes held by Jeff Bezos’s siblings were valued at $640 million each, based on Amazon’s stock closing price of $91 at the time. Fast forward to the present, and with Amazon’s stock price at $149, their stakes are now valued at $1.044 billion each.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market. Are Wall Street's days numbered? This startup's game-changing solution could disrupt finance forever.\n\nBezos, recognizing the emerging potential of e-commerce, embarked on an ambitious venture by founding Amazon in July 1994. This was a time when the internet was primarily used by government and educational institutions. Despite these limitations, Bezos was undeterred and pursued his vision, seeing the broader possibilities that the internet could offer.\n\nConvincing investors, including his family, of the venture’s potential despite a high risk of failure was a monumental task. Bezos cautioned his parents about the 70% risk of losing their investment. According to the book \"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,\" he said, \"I want you to know what the risks are because I still want to come home for Thanksgiving if this doesn't work.\"\n\nIn 1994, Bezos reportedly held 60 meetings with family members, friends and potential investors in an attempt to persuade them to invest in his online bookshop idea. Out of the 60 people he approached, 38 were not convinced. Years later, Bezos reflected on these early rejections, noting how some of those who declined his offer were still affected by their decision, either accepting it as part of life or finding it too painful to discuss.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s journey to success was fraught with challenges. It went public on May 15, 1997, at $18 per share, navigating through the turbulent times of the dot-com bubble. Yet, under Bezos’s leadership, the company not only survived but flourished, expanding beyond online retail and achieving a market cap of $1.5 trillion.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch – the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nMark and Christina Bezos, despite their low public profiles, have been integral to Amazon’s story. Mark Bezos, diverging from the Amazon path, carved out a successful career in advertising and philanthropy, while Christina Bezos has maintained a discreet presence, focusing on family and philanthropic efforts.\n\nThe Bezos siblings’ journey with Amazon, from a high-risk investment to a billion-dollar return, underscores the power of visionary entrepreneurship and the potential of the digital economy. Their story, intertwined with the rise of one of the world’s most influential companies, highlights the far-reaching impact of strategic risk-taking in the rapidly evolving world of technology and commerce.\n\nThe story of the Bezos siblings and their investment in Amazon is more than a tale of financial gain; it’s an example of the potential of startups. Their success is a reminder that investing in a startup, while risky, can lead to extraordinary outcomes. It’s about spotting opportunities in visionary ideas and the courage to back them, even when the future seems uncertain.\n\nImagine being part of something that starts small but grows into a global phenomenon. That’s the allure of investing in startups. Today’s small online bookstore could be tomorrow’s tech giant.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhy you’ve been left out of the insanely profitable business of website flipping until now.

        "title": "Walgreens earnings: First quarter profits up on an adjusted basis, but drug store chain slashes dividend",
        "content": "Walgreens (WBA) stock was down about 2% in pre-market trading on the news that the company is cutting its dividend by 48% to 25 cents a share, from 48 cents a share, for the fiscal first quarter of 2024.\n\nNew CEO Tim Wentworth, formerly the CEO of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (CI), said the move was a difficult decision supported by the board, and one that is necessary as the company moves forward on its strategy to revamp stores and double down as a retail giant.\n\nThat strategy is, for now, not pivoting entirely away from the focus on retail stores, Wentworth said.\n\nThe company reported that first quarter sales, for the period ending November 30, 2023, rose 10% year over year totaling $36.7 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. Walgreens also beat the Street on adjusted earnings per share with 66 cents per share, compared to consensus of 62 cents per share.\n\nThe adjusted earnings per share was a result of a tax hit from sales of shares of Cencora, formerly AmeriSource Bergen. The company is maintaining its 2024 guidance of $3.20 to $3.50 earnings per share.\n\nWalgreens, the second largest retail pharmacy chain, has recently made moves in health care services and clinical trial offerings, prompting speculation the company would mimic its rival CVS (CVS)—and get into the insurance business asCVS did by acquiring Aetna.\n\n\"I do not want to write insurance, I don't know why we would do that,\" Wentworth said.\n\n\"But I also don't want to turn away from the store. I think one of the mistakes in the narrative (is) that we are going to, or are, turned away from the store. I think what we have to do is use the store as the point of engagement,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWentworth said he is invigorated by the potential Walgreens has as a trusted healthcare brand. The pharmacy counter, he added, is where trust begins, as evidenced by the willingness of customers to \"put a needle in their arm\" or consult on medical needs. (Wentworth also said that COVID-19 vaccine volumes haven't been as low as expected in the quarter.)\n\nStory continues\n\nThis all comes at a time when retail healthcare is competing with traditional facilities like doctor's offices and hospitals—and also e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN).\n\nBut Wentworth thinks there is still room to win the battle if he can redefine how the store operates. He sees three ways to do this:\n\nPare down. \"We've got too much of an assortment, for sure,\" he said. \"And that's inefficient for a lot of reasons...the national brands would start competing to be the one that's on our shelves alongside of our own brand.\n\nThe Walgreens brand. Walgreens is in a great position to be trusted as a private label, but it needs to repackage, Wentworth said—and the pharmacists could help with sales by recommending Walgreens branded products as needed.\n\n\"Turning the store managers loose.\" Managers don't currently get paid based on store performance, but Wentworth wants to change that. Turning managers loose? A Walgreens store in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa.) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nInternational bright spot\n\nDespite recent reports that Walgreens is looking to offload its U.K. chain, Boots, Wentworth said all options are still on the table. \"I've got nothing to share on a decision, at all,\" Wentworth said, noting that it is one of the best-performing assets in the company.\n\nBut, he added, \"Everything is on the table.\"\n\nWalgreens was looking to unload Boots two years ago, when market conditions weren't great, but that is no longer the case.\n\nThe international segment, meanwhile, performed well with first quarter sales of nearly $6 billion, or an increase of 12.4% year over year. Boots.com reported sales growth of 17.5%, accounting for 19% of Boots total retail sales, Walgreens reported.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 1.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share, indicating a change of +276.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 points to a change of +278.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.60 indicates a change of +34% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $166.12 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $570.95 billion and $637.49 billion estimates indicate +11.1% and +11.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.6%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.20 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $141.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.1%. The EPS surprise was +46.55%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Roku Inc. ROKU announced the launch of the Roku Pro Series televisions (TVs), expanding the company's lineup of TVs in the United States to boost device sales in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe key features of these high-end TVs include a powerful streaming experience, exceptional picture quality with a 4K QLED display, Mini-LED, local dimming and enhanced audio technology for a cinematic sound. The design is described as elegant, with the TV able to rest flat against the wall, making it suitable for streaming purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Roku Pro Series TVs are offered in three sizes: 55\", 65\" and 75\". These are designed to integrate everything that Roku customers appreciate, with a focus on refined hardware design. Roku Pro Series functions on its award-winning operating system and comes with a new premium remote for an enhanced streaming experience.\r\n\r\nROKU has also introduced Roku Smart Picture, a set of features that will be added to the Roku TV program in spring 2024. This feature uses artificial intelligence, machine learning and data from content partners to automatically adjust the picture based on the type of content on the screen, providing an optimized viewing experience.\r\n\r\nThe pricing details reveal that the Roku Pro Series TVs, along with an optional mount designed by the company, will be available in the United States in spring 2024. The retail prices for these TVs will be under $1,500.\n\nRoku, Inc. Price and Consensus Roku, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nRoku, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Roku, Inc. Quote\n\nExpanded TV Offerings to Fend Off Competition\n\nWith the addition of the company’s own Roku Select and Plus series in 2023, the Roku TV family continues to grow and evolve to the delight of the consumer, and more is coming in spring 2024, with the newly announced Roku Pro Series.\r\n\r\nROKU's commitment to delivering a seamless and superior streaming experience at competitive prices has propelled it to become the #1 selling TV operating system in the United States and Mexico.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 32.6% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s rise of 4% due to its extensive collection of content and product offerings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRoku generates more than 80% of its annual revenues from its streaming platform. The rise in global streaming is evident through its customers, who have collectively viewed an impressive 100 billion streaming hours on a trailing 12-month basis, with an average of 3.9 streaming hours per day per active account (as of third-quarter 2023).\r\n\r\nThis is likely to fend off tough competition from giants like Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL.\r\n\r\nGoogle TV by Alphabet has significantly improved its user experience, addressing previous issues with the latest Chromecast model. This device supports a broad range of streaming apps, including popular ones like YouTube and Spotify. However, there may be some limitations in terms of storage management.\r\n\r\nAmazon Fire TV is deeply integrated into Amazon's ecosystem, giving priority to AMZN's content and featuring a robust voice interface. Yet, at times, it gives the impression of functioning more as an advertising platform for Amazon products rather than providing a diverse app and content ecosystem.\r\n\r\nApple TV boasts a refined interface with its attention to detail. While it supports most apps, it appears that AAPL places a stronger emphasis on its Apple TV+ subscription service and app rather than focusing primarily on the hardware itself.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Conversely, declines tend to occur when investors least expect them.\n\nAlthough 2023 began well for real estate investment trusts (REITs), by February it was obvious that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates much more to get back to its desired 2% inflation target. The next eight months then proved difficult for REITs, as multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve sent most of the group into a substantial decline.\n\nREITs bottomed out at the end of October and bounced back nicely over the last two months as the Fed paused rates for three consecutive months and projected three possible rate cuts in 2024. Office and mortgage REITs (mREITs) were particularly strong, but all subsectors participated in the rally.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nFor all of 2023, the S&P 500 outperformed the real estate sector by 24.58% to 12.41%. Over the last three months of the year, real estate outperformed the S&P 500, 18.8% to 11.25%.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, if investors were asked which REITs would lead the group in total return this year, many might have pointed to long-term stalwarts such as Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT), EquinixInc. (NYSE:EQIX) or perhaps Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) as the favorites.\n\nBut investors might be surprised to hear that only some of those REITs were anywhere near the top 20 leaders. Most of the REITs in the top 10 were micro or small-cap stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nTake a closer look at the four best-performing REITs in 2023, along with 10 other REITs that performed well with total returns greater than 39% in 2023.\n\nAngel Oak Mortgage REIT Inc. (NYSE:AOMR) is an Atlanta-based mREIT that specializes in offering wholesale nonqualified (non-QM) mortgage loans for borrowers who don't fit traditional lending guidelines. Some of their mortgages include investor cash flow loans, asset-qualifying loans and loans for self-employed people.  Angel Oak is a micro-cap stock with a $273.62 million cap rate.\n\nFollowing a terrible 2022 in which Angel Oak Mortgage had a total return (including dividends) of negative 61.9%, it led all REITs in 2023 with a stunning 129.64% total return.\n\nAbout 65% of its total return occurred in January when mREITs and other financial services companies bounced higher from extremely oversold levels. But Angel Oak was a steady gainer throughout the year.\n\nTanger Inc. (NYSE:SKT), formerly called Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc., is a Greensboro, North Carolina-based retail REIT that owns 38 indoor shopping centers and outdoor factory outlet malls with 15 million square feet and over 3,000 stores across 20 states and in Canada. Tanger Factory Outlet Centers was founded in 1981 and had its initial public offering (IPO) in May 1993. Tanger is a small-cap stock with a $3.02 billion cap rate.\n\nTanger has produced some positive news in recent months. On Oct. 13, Tanger announced a 6.1% increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.245 to $0.26 per share, increasing its annualized dividend from $0.98 to $1.04 per share.\n\nAs so often happens, a dividend increase shortly before earnings are reported portends a good quarter for the company. On Nov. 6, Tanger reported its third-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.50 beat the estimates of $0.47 and was above its FFO of $0.47 in the third quarter of 2022. Revenue of $117.35 million beat the estimates of $110.02 million and revenue of $111.45 million in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nWith the solid quarter in hand, Tanger also boosted its 2023 full-year guidance of FFO from $1.85-$1.92 to $1.90-$1.94. That caught investors' attention and led to two solid months of appreciation to end the year.\n\nTanger has also been aggressive in recent acquisitions. On Nov. 30, Tanger announced it had acquired Bridge Street Town Centre, an 825,000-square-foot open-air lifestyle center in Huntsville, Alabama. Bridge Street has 80 retail stores, restaurants and entertainment sites. Two weeks earlier, Tanger announced the $70 million acquisition of Asheville Outlets in Ashville, North Carolina.\n\nOn Dec. 18, JPMorgan analyst Michael Mueller upgraded Tanger from Neutral to Overweight and raised the price target from $27 to $29.\n\nTanger was the second-best REIT overall in 2023, with a total return of 63.58%, overcoming the popular idea that in-store retail shopping is in decline because of the popularity of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online retailers.\n\nSeven Hills Realty Trust (NYSE:SEVN) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based mortgage REIT since 2008. It originates and invests in first mortgages that are secured by middle market and transitional commercial real estate. It's externally managed by Tremont Realty Capital, a subsidiary of the RMR GroupInc. (NASDAQ:RMR). Seven Hills is a micro-cap stock with a $193.88 million cap rate. Highlights for the year included:\n\nOn July 18, Seven Hills Realty announced it closed a $26.5 million bridge loan to finance the acquisition of Woodfield Commerce Center, a 320,000-square-foot industrial warehouse property in Fountain Inn, South Carolina. The two-year initial term loan has a possible one-year extension option. On Sept. 26, Seven Hills Realty appointed Fernando Diaz as its new chief financial officer and treasurer, effective Oct. 1. On Oct. 31, Seven Hills Realty Trust reported its third-quarter operating results. Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.36 missed the estimates of $0.37 but was a 33.3% increase over EPS of $0.27 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $9.8 million beat the estimates for $8.76 million and was a 25.6% increase over revenue of $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2022. On Dec. 5, Seven Hills announced it closed on a $29 million bridge loan to refinance a 174-room Tapestry Collection by Hilton hotel in Anaheim, California. The loan has a two-year initial term with three annual extension options.\n\nSeven Hills Realty has increased its year-over-year EPS growth over the last four quarters, and that contributed to a total return of 58.53% in 2023.\n\nPark Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK) is a Tysons, Virginia-based REIT with more than 26,000 rooms in 43 hotels and resorts in prime U.S. markets with high barriers to entry. Properties in Hawaii account for 36% of its portfolio. Park Hotels is a small-cap stock with a market cap of $3.63 billion.\n\nPark was established as an independent company in January 2017 following its spinoff from Hilton. In September 2019, Park acquired Chesapeake Lodging Trust to add premium-brand hotels and resorts in prime markets such as Miami, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nAlthough Park Hotels is the leading hotel REIT and fourth-highest overall with a 53.95% gain in 2023, it should be noted that at a recent close of $15.37, it's still well below its pre-COVID and 2021 highs near $23.20.\n\nDecember was a particularly good month for Park Hotels investors. One event that recently boosted its share price was Park Hotels' announcement that in addition to its regular quarterly dividend, it will pay out two special cash dividends in January because of closing out two properties that were formerly in receivership.\n\nOn Dec. 14, JP Morgan analyst Brandt Montour upgraded Park Hotels and Resorts from Underweight to Neutral and raised the price target 45.4% from $11 to $16.\n\nOn Dec. 20, Park reaffirmed its 2023 outlook for comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) and other metrics from its third-quarter earnings.\n\nPark Hotels was the leading hotel REIT and fourth-best overall REIT in 2023 with a 53.95% total return.\n\nIn addition to the four REITs named above, 10 other REITs performed superbly in 2023. The chart below details their cap size, subsector and total return this year.\n\nNAME SYMBOL CAP SIZE SUBSECTOR 2023 TOTAL RETURN % Empire State Realty Trust Inc.

WELL Large Health Care 39.64 Lument Finance Trust Inc. LFT Micro Mortgage 39.36\n\nThe improving relative strength of REITs can be seen by the representation of seven different subsectors among the top 14 REITs of 2023, rather than just one or two subsectors being predominant.\n\nNote: All REITs cited in this article were over $5 per share.

        "title": "4 Stocks I'm Going \"All In\" on in 2024",
        "content": "Sometimes, the market gives investors once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunities. While there aren't as many of those available right now due to the market nearing all-time highs, there are a few stocks I see myself going \"all in\" on in 2024.\n\nSo, what are these stocks? Read on to find out.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock I'm excited about in 2024. While the third quarter was a high note for many of Amazon's business segments, its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business reported a ho-hum quarter. However, management noted that some of the headwinds are beginning to die down while new workloads are coming online.\n\nCouple that tailwind with Amazon's margin profile, and you've got a recipe for a stock that could have a phenomenal 2024. In Q3, nearly all of Amazon's profit measures approached all-time highs. Furthermore, they did it without secular tailwinds (like COVID-19 lockdowns). AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith Amazon set to have a full year of high profits and a rebounding business segment, I'm confident in significantly increasing my position size.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nLike Amazon, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is big tech company that dealt with some headwinds throughout 2023. The advertising market (making up nearly 80% of Alphabet's revenue) was soft in late 2022 and early 2023, as many advertisers cut their budgets to prepare for a recession.\n\nNow that the economic outlook has improved and Alphabet has lapped those year-over-year comparisons, it's starting to show solid growth. In Q2, Alphabet's revenue rose 11% year over year, helping its earnings per share improve from $1.06 to $1.55.\n\nThis will boost Alphabet's stock throughout 2024, but it also has another tailwind: artificial intelligence. AI is a huge investment for Alphabet, and with the launch of its latest Gemini generative AI model beating the competition on many benchmark tests, it could be a new revenue driver for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's 2024 should be solid, and investors would be wise to establish a position before it takes off.\n\n3. UiPath\n\nUiPath (NYSE: PATH) is slightly more obscure than the previous two stocks. It's focused on robotic process automation (RPA) software, which helps automate repetitive tasks within a business. UiPath is also a big AI user, as it utilizes AI to increase the tasks it can automate as well as analyze what activities employees are doing to see what could be automated.\n\nThe RPA opportunity is massive, with Polaris Market Research projecting a $66 billion market by 2032. Compared to the $2.6 billion market Polaris estimated in 2022, this software sector has a lot of growth ahead.\n\nUiPath is already a major player, with its annual recurring revenue sitting at $1.38 billion (up 24% year over year).\n\nWith UiPath growing quickly in an important market, it is a top stock pick for 2024.\n\n4. DLocal\n\nDLocal (NASDAQ: DLO) gives its clients the ability to sell to emerging market countries like Egypt, Turkey, and India. Instead of a large client (like Amazon, Shopify, or Nike) developing its own solution for these countries (which often have vastly different online payment options than in the U.S.), it can work with DLocal, which has already done the legwork to create these payment avenues.\n\nBy conceding a bit of revenue to DLocal, clients increase their market opportunity drastically and capture many important customer bases.\n\nUnsurprisingly, DLocal is growing quickly, with revenue rising 47% year over year to $164 million. However, what may come as a surprise is its profitability levels. In Q3, DLocal posted a $40.4 million profit, up 25% year over year. This is good enough for a 25% profit margin, a level few companies attain.\n\nWith DLocal recently trading for just 23 times 2023 earnings, it's great to load up before other investors discover it.\n\nThese are the stocks I'm planning on going \"all in\" on in 2024. While that doesn't mean I will sell all of the other stocks in my portfolio to fund these investments, it does mean I will channel a significant portion of my contributions to these stocks. However, I won't weight more than 10% of my portfolio to any of these companies, as anything more than that may cause me to become too worried about the position.\n\nThis figure may be smaller or larger for you, but I'm confident that a position in these four will be a solid investment for 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Ten expert share tips for 2024",
        "content": "Share tips\n\nBritish stocks endured a rocky ride in 2023. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares reached peaks in February, April and September, only to drop significantly in November before a late-year rally to hit 7,733 on the last trading day of December to record a 2.4pc rise over the year.\n\nThe rise comes as some listed British companies boomed. Aerospace business Rolls-Royce saw its share price triple in 2023, while shares in Marks & Spencer gained 114pc.\n\nWe asked investing experts for their top stock picks for 2024.\n\nAlex Campbell, of trading app Freetrade\n\nPfizer\n\nIt was a pandemic darling but Pfizer’s shares took a beating in 2023: they lost 44pc last year after revenues from the company’s Covid vaccine and treatment fell.\n\nWe’re not all getting our annual vaccine booster any more and this has meant Pfizer’s revenues and earnings figures look anaemic.\n\nBut it’s worth looking beyond the pandemic to a deep and growing pipeline of treatments on the market now or coming to the market soon.\n\nThere’s also Pfizer’s acquisition of the genetic medicine specialist Seagen, which is worth an estimated $10bn (£8bn) in revenues by 2030.\n\nNon-Covid-related revenues are expected to grow at a percentage in the high single digits while up to $45bn in revenue from new drug launches and acquisitions is expected.\n\nThat would allow the company to exceed the revenues made during the pandemic.\n\nWith the share price about half the levels of 18 months ago and a steadily growing dividend that equates to a current yield of nearly 6pc, this giant of the pharmaceutical industry is worth a look for 2024.\n\nBurberry\n\nCloser to home, it may be worth considering an icon of British fashion in the form of Burberry.\n\nThe luxury goods market struggled in 2023 as cost-of-living pressures meant fewer people were buying the higher-end fashions produced by Burberry. Falling inflation could revive the luxury market - Kyle Lam/Bloomberg\n\nThere was also been a decline in foreign demand as Chinese tourism, one of the big drivers of demand for European luxury brands, remained subdued throughout the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe “China reopening” narrative that was expected to shape global markets in 2023 never materialised.\n\nBut change is afoot. Tourist numbers are gently increasing and global economies seem to be turning a corner. If inflation stays low, consumers may be feeling a bit more flush with cash and willing to splurge on that pricey brolly or trench coat.\n\nI wouldn’t rule Burberry out for an opportunistic takeover either. A private equity fund or luxury goods conglomerate may see the chance to go shopping for bargains. The shares trade at just 12 to 13 times earnings, which may be too good a deal to give up.\n\nMamta Valechha, share analyst at Quilter\n\nAdidas\n\nIn 2023 Adidas focused on reviving its brand, cleaning up inventory, improving relationships with retailers, steadying the ship in China and finding a solution to the Yeezy merchandise it had to unload following the end of its relationship with the controversial rapper Kanye West.\n\nWe have seen growth in the brand – the Samba is officially the shoe of the year and Chinese influencers and sportspeople are willing to work with Adidas again.\n\nYeezy was a big risk going into 2023. The first two tranches were sold immediately and we expect Adidas to sell the remainder in 2024. Adidas turned its brand around in 2023 - JUAN MABROMATA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFinally, Lionel Messi’s move to Inter Miami has driven a huge brand boost in the US for football merchandise.\n\nThe key question is whether this brand jump can be sustained in 2024. We think it can.\n\nOrders for the first half of the year have already been placed by retailers and orders for the second half are being placed now, so the company’s management has great visibility and remains very bullish.\n\nJD Sports\n\nWe believe JD’s positioning as a global brand and sportswear retailer and its international opportunity are under-appreciated by the market.\n\nJD remains the most important global strategic partner for top sportswear brands including Nike and Adidas, which gives it access to superior product allocations and exclusive products, while it is also directly benefiting from sports brand consolidation among wholesale partners.\n\nThe retailer also has a well-invested store estate, complemented by strong digital capabilities.\n\nImproving profitability in international markets and acquired businesses also presents a material tailwind to earnings. Finally, its strong cash position gives JD the opportunity to expand through mergers and acquisitions, where it has a strong record of creating value.\n\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft is a one-stop shop for everything a business needs in technology: infrastructure, operating systems, software, search, advertising, gaming, AI – the list goes on.\n\nThe fact that AI can be put into all its products gives Microsoft a huge value runway, which in turn gives it a considerable pricing runway and makes it an interesting stock for investors to consider.\n\nAmazon\n\nThere are two sides to Amazon: Amazon Web Services and the retail business. AWS growth appears to have bottomed and is expected to improve in the near future, while the retail business continues to accelerate.\n\nAmazon invested heavily in both businesses during the pandemic and is now harvesting that investment.\n\nUltimately it comes down to capacity utilisation, and Amazon’s improved cloud data centre and ecommerce fulfilment centre utilisation will result in better profitability.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell\n\nJourneo\n\nInvesting in smaller companies is not for everyone but, for those willing to consider them, Journeo stands out. It provides technology systems for bus and rail operators and real-time information for passengers.\n\nFor example, the company says its digital wing mirrors improve visibility for bus drivers, eradicate blind spots and reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nNews from the company has been positive over the past year with strong trading, and acquisitions have opened doors to new opportunities.\n\nAnalysts expect pre-tax profits to reach £3.9m this year and £4.4m next – quite a breakthrough compared with £900,000 in 2022.\n\nAt 266p Journeo’s shares trade at about 11.5 times next year’s forecast earnings. That low figure puts the stock into “value” investing territory even after the shares nearly doubled in 2023.\n\nWhitbread\n\nWhitbread’s Premier Inn chain is a reliable place for travellers to get a room for the night without breaking the bank. Business people are also happy to stay in its hotels because they are clean and of decent enough quality.\n\nThe more people stay in its hotels, the more opportunities Whitbread has to make ancillary revenue through food and drink as well as push up room rates.\n\nA solid performance in Britain gives the group a stronger footing to fund expansion in Germany. It also gives management the confidence to improve facilities in Britain, such as installing new beds and upgrading rooms to “Premium Plus”, for which it can charge more.\n\nThe fact that Whitbread can also afford to grow dividends and buy back shares implies that it has confidence in the future.\n\nPremier Inn markets itself as a place to get a good night’s sleep and that’s exactly what investors might expect from owning shares in Whitbread.\n\nHowever, they must not think of it as a risk-free proposition. An economic downturn in 2024 could cause headwinds for the chain, although Whitbread’s management should know how to navigate such conditions.\n\nVictoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor\n\nBarratt Developments\n\nHousebuilders have faced a lengthy list of headwinds over the past year including cost inflation, squeezed mortgage affordability and waning demand. Momentum appears to be gathering for housebuilders such as Barratt - REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nHowever, falls in inflation and expectations that the Bank of England will cut rates in 2024 could provide a more favourable outlook for the housebuilders, including Barratt Developments, in the year ahead.\n\nBarratt’s shares have bounced off their lows since October and momentum appears to be gathering. The share price is still around 40pc below its pre-pandemic highs and a price-to-earnings ratio of around 10 is roughly in the middle ground for the sector.\n\nEven after a dividend cut last year it still yields an attractive 6.4pc. This could be particularly enticing amid the shaky economic backdrop. Indeed, net cash of £1.1bn leaves Barratt in a healthy position to weather any immediate storms.\n\nIt has stepped back from investment in new land and opted for a “highly selective” approach.\n\nAt the same time, a continued focus on cost control, the targeted use of incentives and sales to the private rental and social housing sectors are all likely to become dominant themes in the shorter term.\n\nMatt Britzman, share analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown\n\nLloyds Banking Group\n\nBritish banks certainly aren’t feeling the love right now.

Unlike its two rival discounters, TikTok is counting on its social media reach and the appeal of viral videos to hook buyers.\n\nTikTok was last year on track to amass around $20 billion in global gross merchandise value, with Southeast Asia contributing the bulk of sales through its platform, Bloomberg News reported. Now, the company is seeking to expand sales in the US and Latin America, where it’s planning to launch the e-commerce operation in coming months, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nA representative for TikTok declined to comment.\n\nRead more: Jack Ma’s Biggest E-Commerce Rival Is Coming for Amazon, Walmart\n\nByteDance, founded more than a decade ago by Zhang Yiming and Liang Rubo, grew into an internet leader worth more than $200 billion thanks to the virality of short-video platforms TikTok and Douyin. TikTok Shop is one of the fastest-growing features for the Beijing-based, closely held company, which is seeking a new growth driver beyond social-media advertising. ByteDance’s revenue surged roughly 30% in 2023 to more than $110 billion, outpacing the projected growth of far more established social media rivals Meta Platforms Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: ByteDance’s Sales Break $110 Billion to Pass Tencent in 2023\n\nTikTok Shop lets users buy items while scrolling through a perpetual feed of short videos and live streams within its main social media app, hoping consumers use it as an alternative to Amazon or Sea Ltd.’s Shopee. That format — an effort to combine the ease of shopping on Amazon with the product discovery afforded by apps like Meta’s Instagram — has already helped Douyin snatch a significant portion of Chinese consumer spending from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc., particularly after lockdown rules during the pandemic drove people to spend more time online.\n\nByteDance is intent on exporting its e-commerce model globally. In the US, TikTok is offering free shipping and subsidies to influencers who peddle gadgets, clothes and makeup in videos and live streams. In November, boosted by Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, more than 5 million new US customers bought something on TikTok, the company said. It has roughly 150 million users in the country.\n\nRead more: TikTok Shop Is Looking to Beat Amazon on Its Home Turf\n\nAmericans are increasingly comfortable shopping on Chinese e-commerce apps, including the popular fashion site Shein and PDD Holdings Inc.’s Temu, which has exploded in popularity since airing a Super Bowl ad in February.\n\nIt’s unclear what sales targets TikTok Shop has set globally or for other markets. In Indonesia, TikTok has taken control of GoTo Group’s e-commerce unit Tokopedia in a $1.5 billion deal, which allowed the company to restart its online retail service after months of scrutiny by the local government.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHelp, I Saw My Boss on a Dating Site Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?

        "title": "Wall Street: 2024 Is The Year Of The Pivot",
        "content": "U.S. and European equity markets have kicked off the new year on the backfoot, with both pulling back slightly on the second trading day of 2024 from 2023 record high closes.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down 60 points to 4,714 from its 2023 close at 1130 hrs ET on Wednesday while the Stoxx Europe 600 was also down marginally. Yields on 10-year US bonds and German bunds have also started creeping up, with the U.S. rate quoted at 3.956% as money markets wagered on the Federal Reserve cutting rates by fewer than 150 basis points in 2024.\n\nThankfully, the U.S. energy sector has started the year on a more positive note, with the sector’s benchmark Energy Select Sector Fund (XLE) up 2.1% in the first two trading days and Brent and WTI gaining over 3% on Wednesday.\n\nGrowing tensions in the  Middle East have worsened fears of oil supply disruptions after an Iranian warship entered the Red Sea and raised the specter of the conflict spilling over into the region.\n\nThe markets remain a bit edgy because of the uncertainty surrounding precisely when the Federal will start cutting rates, and also because the Fed has cautioned about the lingering possibility of a mild recession.\n\nMarket action suggests there’s an outside chance of a 25-basis-point cut at just 12.9% in January, but a much bigger 87.1% chance that the central bank will leave rates unchanged when it releases its December meeting minutes on Wednesday at 1400 hrs ET. Fed officials held the policy interest rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range at their meeting in mid-December, but signaled they would cut rates by at least 75 basis points in the current year as inflation steadily declines to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nRelated: Oil Gains Over 3% On Libya, OPEC and Middle East Escalation\n\nThat said, equity markets remain largely bullish with Principal Financial Group predicting that 2024 is setting up to be the \"year of the pivot.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n“Markets surprised to the upside in 2023, despite a host of challenges, and fought off a widely expected recession to finish the year near record highs. Looking ahead to 2024, the market rebound, combined with the Federal Reserve’s rate pause, has set the stage for a long-anticipated pivot toward rate cuts,” Principal said in an investor note.\n\nIn other words, investors are looking forward to further gains in the stock markets in 2024. The U.S. market returned just under 25% while its European peer gained 13% in 2023 amid optimism that central banks will return to a rate cut regime. Supporting the optimistic market viewpoint is the fact that headline inflation decelerated to 3.1% in November, unemployment has declined to 3.7%  while 2023 GDP growth could potentially clock in at 2.6% based on the Federal Reserve’s latest projections.\n\nSource: J.P. Morgan\n\nBut it’s not just Wall Street that’s feeling upbeat about the new year. The American Association of Individual Investors has reported an underlying shift towards a bullish position with many bearish investor viewpoints now in the rearview mirror.\n\nAccording to a year-end sentiment survey put together by the organization, 46.3% of investors are bullish on the broader market; 25.1% hold a bearish stance while 28.6% remain neutral. While the majority of investors are still either bearish or neutral, it’s important to note that the sentiment has shifted dramatically over the past two months considering that only 24.3% of individuals were bullish while 50.3% looked at the market from a bearish lens when the survey was carried out on Nov. 1.\n\nHistorical precedent also seems to favor the bulls.\n\nOn Monday, Ned Davis Research noted that the S&P 500 sat less than 1% from its all-time trading high of 4,818 that it hit on Jan. 3, 2022. The analysts have noted that the gap between those two peaks is the sixth longest between record highs, and such lengthy gaps tend to be followed by a period of outperformance.\n\n“There have been 14 cases of the S&P 500 going at least one year without an all-time high. After the record has been eclipsed, the S&P 500 has outperformed its long-term average one-, three-, six-, and 12-months later. One-month returns are not quite as strong (up 71% of the time by a median of 1.8%), suggesting a short-term overbought condition. One year later, the index has risen 13 out of 14 times by a median of 13.4%. A new high after a long stretch often marks a new stage of the bull market rather than its conclusion,’’ the analysts have noted.\n\nJanuary Selloff For Megacap Tech Stocks\n\nBut not all corners of the market are expected to remain hale and hearty; at least not in the early innings of the year. Bank of America has warned about a January \"rout\" in megacap tech stocks, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp.(NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in danger of underperforming.\n\n\"Crowding risk in the leaders of 2023 has been cited by many (including ourselves) as a key risk in 2024. In particular, year-end 'window dressing' may have pushed active funds into big Tech leaders, but these stocks could be used as a source of funds if a hard landing is avoided and leadership broadens beyond secular growth stocks,\" BofA equity strategist Savita Subramanian has said in a note.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nArgentina’s New President Is Looking To Shake Up Its Oil Industry The 11 States Leading America’s Oil Production Boom What Will Influence Oil Prices in 2024?\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com",

        "content": "A lot of the credit for the U.S. averting an economic recession over the past year is going to consumers as their spending has remained strong despite elevated interest rates. The latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed that retail sales in November were up 0.1% from October, and up 3.1% from a year earlier. Despite a high interest rate environment, strong consumer spending has helped stave off an economic meltdown, so investors should be paying attention to top retail stocks in 2024.\n\nDuring the holiday shopping season at the end of 2023, consumers spent a record $9.8 billion on online shopping alone on Black Friday according to Adobe Analytics. Increasingly, shopping is moving away from in-store purchases at brick-and-mortar locations and to e-commerce channels. Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce found that e-commerce sales in America grew 7% year-over-year (YOY) in 2023 to reach $1.1 trillion, and the shift online looks likely to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) remains an extremely popular athletic apparel retailer, and a popular retail stock. Over the past 12 months, LULU stock has risen 53%, bringing its five year gain to 287%. Much of the company’s success is due to its e-commerce strategy. Lululemon’s direct e-commerce sales accounted for 50% of its total sales during the Covid-19 pandemic when its brick-and-mortar outlets were shuttered. Today, online sales account for 42% of its total sales volume.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s good news for the company and its shareholders as online sales through direct e-commerce channels are more profitable than sales at brick-and-mortar locations. Strong online sales also help to explain why Lululemon has a gross profit margin of more than 55%, which is among the highest in retail. In December, the company reported earnings that once again beat Wall Street forecasts, with third-quarter revenue up 19% from a year ago at $2.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrand recognition, smart e-commerce choices and expected longevity make LULU one of the top retail stocks for investors to be paying attention to right now.\n\nWalmart (WMT) WMT Stock\n\nThe discount retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has made boosting its e-commerce strategy a central focus since the Covid-19 pandemic took hold nearly four years ago. And the company’s efforts are paying off. In its most recent third-quarter financial report, Walmart reported that its online sales in the U.S. increased 24% YOY compared to a 3% annualized increase in sales at its brick-and-mortar stores. The company’s online sales were expected to get a further boost during the holiday shopping season.\n\nWalmart has invested heavily in e-commerce as it strives to compete against its main rival for online shopping, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Currently, Amazon controls 38% of e-commerce sales in the U.S. compared with 6% at Walmart. However, Walmart is making some important strides towards closing that gap.\n\nThe company’s net sales from its e-commerce channel grew 12% to $53.4 billion between 2019 and 2023. Walmart’s shopping app is now more popular than Amazon’s, attracting nearly 27 million daily active users each month versus 18 million at Amazon. WMT stock has gained 11% in the last 12 months.\n\nAs a long time player in the retail space and a giant in online shopping, WMT is a solid pick for investors looking for retail stocks.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Tower of Carvana cars in a 'car vending machine.'\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIts stock is volatile and not for every investor, but there’s no question that Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) has upended the process of buying used vehicles. The company is an online-only used car retailer that enables consumers to buy, sell and trade-in vehicles with the click of a mouse. Carvana is also known for its multi-story car vending machines. In August 2023, Carvana introduced same-day delivery for customers who are either purchasing or selling a vehicle from its website.\n\nWith its focus on e-commerce sales and its move away from traditional brick-and-mortar car lots, Carvana has managed to carve out a niche role for itself within the automotive industry. The company remains the fastest growing online used car dealer in the U.S., placing it among the top 10 U.S. retailers by e-commerce sales. In 2022, Carvana had nearly $20 billion in online sales, up 50% from a year earlier.\n\nBut despite its growth, CVNA stock is volatile. In 2023, the share price gained more than 900%. However, CVNA stock remains down 87% from an all-time high reached in August 2021. Investors considering retail stocks that are shaking up the brick-and-mortar standard should proceed with caution when looking at Carvana.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Hidden Market Gems: 3 Small-Cap Stocks With Big Potential in 2024",
        "content": "Small-cap stocks are looking attractive now to many investors, including myself. These companies, on the whole, have lower valuations than their large-cap counterparts, meaning they could deliver the needed gains investors seek.\n\nLast year was categorized by an astonishing lack of market breadth, with the Magnificent Seven accounting for almost all of the gains in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indices. This year might be when small-cap stocks make up for lost ground, especially since many large and mega-cap stocks already have too rich a valuation for many investors’ tastes.\n\nSo, to fully tap into the potential of these types of companies, here are three small-cap stocks presently underappreciated by the market and could be potential multi-baggers in the making.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLemonade (LMND) Lemonade stock logo displayed on smartphone laying on top of computer keyboard.\n\nSource: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com\n\nLemonade (NYSE:LMND) is a technology-driven company in the insurance sector. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) and related tech to dig into data and deliver insights its competitors miss. It has a distinctive use of chatbots for automating the onboarding and claims process, saving customers from long waiting times.\n\nLMND also takes a utilitarian approach to its business model, as it charges a fixed fee to customers as its premiums to cover costs, then pays out the rest for its claims. Unpaid claims are then donated to charity.\n\nSome of its core operating segments are in the homeowners, renters, pets and life insurance industries. Due to its heavy reliance on automation and chatbots, it also uses sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to determine its customer’s risk profiles. That may also remove potential subjective bias while tailoring each package to the individual.\n\nLMND hits all the right notes on the AI, InsurTech and ESG fronts, which could make it appealing to a broad segment of investors. As for financials, its revenues have grown from $22.50 million in Dec. 2018 to $256.70 million in 2022. However, it has also burned through $131.60 million in cash and has yet to report a profitable quarter on both an accounting and FCF basis. Still, it has enough potential to turn itself around, and it currently trades at a very low price-to-sales basis at just 2.8 times sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. (PLUG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is my favorite contrarian pick and has been for quite some time. The company specializes in producing hydrogen fuel cell systems, primarily used for electric vehicles and other industrial use cases.\n\nPLUG is a (highly risky) contrarian play because there are fears about its ability to remain a going concern, citing major cash burn issues. It has also consistently missed quarterly revenue and EPS estimates.\n\nAs expected, PLUG stock is down by 64.7% over the past year and 97.5% since its share hit the market.\n\nHowever, the company has a few things going for it. Although it’s burning through cash ($1.80 billion over the last 12 months), it does have assets on its balance sheet, a runway, and is producing green hydrogen at its Georgia plant.\n\nIt also has deals with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to supply it with the hydrogen it needs for its vehicles, which could be a major growth driver.\n\nFor investors who originally invested in PLUG, it should be noted its venture was always going to be highly risky and uncertain, so issues like these are par for the course when investing in something speculative. Progress may have been slower than expected, but if the core thesis remains intact, so should people’s commitment.\n\nThat is because PLUG’s shares are as cheap as lottery tickets (and should probably be considered as such), at just $4.59 per share, with a forward price-to-sales ratio of just 1.7 times sales. For those with an extreme risk tolerance, PLUG is one of those investments that could lead to spectacular returns. Wall Street is collectively betting it will turn its fortunes around (just marginally), with a consensus Buy rating from 24 analysts.\n\nNano Dimension (NNDM) Nano Dimension (NNDM stock) logo in an iPad, on the background their proprietary 3D printer\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nNano Dimension (NASDAQ:NNDM) operates in the 3D printing industry, focusing on additive electronics manufacturing.\n\nNNDM is my pick for investors who don’t like to gamble and want momentum for unlocking gains throughout the year. That is due to the company’s most recent quarterly results.\n\nNotably, the company reported strong revenue growth, 22% organic growth for the quarter, and 33% for the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted gross margins also inflated considerably — up 48% for the first nine months of last year.\n\nThe results also came with the CEO reshaping the company’s direction towards cost-cutting and operational efficiency and using its substantial balance sheet to explore M&A deals between other firms. Note that its results have been consistently improving, making it one of those small-cap stocks investors should consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AT&amp;T Stock (NYSE:T): A Contrarian Bet for 2024",
        "content": "Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) is a contrarian bet for 2024. It’s arguably one of the most disliked stocks in the market right now, and it’s easy to understand why. The stock has badly underperformed the broader market for years, and in 2022, it cut its dividend payout. This hurt its standing with dividend investors, who account for a large portion of its shareholder base.\n\nOf the 90 stocks in the S&P 500 (SPX) with market caps of over $100 billion, AT&T is the least-owned stock, so this stock won’t win any popularity contests in the near future. But when a stock becomes this unpopular, it’s often a good time to go against the grain and kick the tires. From this perspective, AT&T could be an enticing contrarian investment opportunity heading into 2024.\n\nI’m bullish on AT&T based on its incredibly inexpensive valuation, compelling dividend yield (still massive even after last year’s reduction), improving debt profile, and surprisingly favorable outlook from analysts.\n\nRemarkably Cheap\n\nIt’s hard to find many major stocks cheaper than AT&T. Shares trade at 6.9 times 2023 earnings estimates and 6.8 times 2024 earnings estimates. AT&T has disappointed investors for many years, so it’s not surprising that it trades cheaply, but this is a huge discount to the S&P 500 (SPX), which has an average price-to-earnings ratio of 21.8, three times AT&T’s valuation.\n\nWhen stocks are this cheap, expectations are generally already low, and lots of bad news is already priced in. Speculation that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could get involved in the wireless industry and concerns that AT&T could face environmental liabilities over lead cables both drove shares lower in 2023. But neither of these concerns came to fruition, and their fallout is already baked into the share price. Conversely, just a bit of good news can often get a stock like this going again.\n\nNo one is going to mistake AT&T for a hot growth stock, but this valuation implies AT&T is a melting ice cube or a “cigar butt” investment, which isn’t the case, either. People are just as reliant on their cell phones and mobile devices as ever and likely will be for the foreseeable future. Revenue actually increased (albeit by a minor amount, from $30.0 billion to $30.4 billion) year-over-year during the most recent quarter, as did cash from operations (from $10.1 billion to $10.3 billion).\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is also a fairly recession-resistant business, as cellular service is one of the last expenses many would consider cutting; like it or not, cell phones have become a necessity of day-to-day life for most people.\n\nImproving Balance Sheet\n\nIt should be noted that part of the reason that AT&T stock is cheap is because the stock is seen as having a heavy debt load.\n\nHowever, this situation is improving. AT&T’s stable business produces a lot of free cash flow, and it has been using this excess cash flow, as well as proceeds from the divestiture of DirecTV and the spinoff of Warner Brothers (NYSE:WBD), to pay down debt. AT&T’s total debt has decreased from nearly $230 billion in March 2022 to just $155.7 billion as of the end of last quarter, a significant improvement.\n\nThe company’s debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.3 is high, but management’s goal is to lower it to 2.5 times by the first half of 2025. As AT&T continues to pay down debt, it could catalyze the share price. Furthermore, when leverage reaches management’s target level, AT&T can put this cash to use in other ways, such as share repurchases, which can serve as another catalyst for shares.\n\nThis is Still a Big-Time Dividend\n\nMany dividend investors understandably soured on AT&T after it cut its dividend payout in 2022. While this was unfortunate for long-time shareholders who relied on the dividend, it’s important to realize that the damage has already been done, and this event is now in the rearview mirror.\n\nGoing forward, AT&T still features a massive 6.6% dividend yield, which is more than four times the dividend yield offered by the S&P 500 (currently 1.5%). It’s one of the top 20 dividend stocks in the S&P 500 by yield. Furthermore, the company’s payout ratio is reasonable, and its dividend cut is now water under the bridge, meaning that the dividend looks fairly safe, going forward. AT&T has also paid dividends to its shareholders for 27 consecutive years.\n\nIs T Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, T earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on seven Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average T stock price target of $19.88 implies 15.25% upside potential.\n\nThe highest forecast on the Street, a $28.00 price target from Tigress Financial’s Ivan Feinseth, implies even more significant upside potential of 62.3%.\n\nThe Takeaway: Smart Contrarian Play\n\nAT&T is one of the least popular stocks in the market today. But look past the negativity, and you’ll see that there is a lot to like here.\n\nThe stock trades for a rock-bottom valuation and yields 6.6%. It has paid down a lot of debt and should continue to do so. It often pays to buy when there is blood in the streets, and AT&T looks like a classic example of that, making it an intriguing contrarian investment opportunity for 2024.\n\nDisclosure",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares were up +75.7% over the past year, which compares to the Zacks Tech sector's +50.4% gain and the +26.1% gain for the Zacks Retail sector (Amazon's own sector). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.\n\nAdditionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.\n\nThe company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+17.0% vs. +13.4%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\r\n\r\nContinued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business.  A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\r\n\r\nHowever, exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind for the company.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\r\n\r\nEli Lilly shares have handily outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+63.8% vs. +11.3%), reflecting the company's impressive offerings in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. Lilly's Q4 results are coming out on February 6th, but they beat top- and bottom-line estimates in the Q3 report on November 2nd.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the back of Lilly's revenue growth is higher demand for drugs like Verzenio, Trulicity, Taltz and others. Sales of its new drug, Mounjaro, are already benefiting from strong demand trends.\n\nLilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. Mounjaro was recently approved for the obesity indication by the name of Zepbound. Mounjaro and Zepbound are expected to be key top-line drivers for Lilly. It has also gained approvals for some other new drugs in 2023.\r\n\r\nHowever, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products are some top-line headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include JPMorgan Chase & Co.

        "title": "The 7 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have delivered incredible returns and crushed the market over the last year -- and the trend looks poised to continue in 2024.\n\nWhile some smaller companies will undoubtedly emerge as winners, the competitive advantages granted by infrastructure and data strengths suggest the AI race will continue to favor large players.\n\nWith that in mind, investors can best position themselves to profit from the AI revolution by building positions in today's category leaders. Read on to see why investing in these resource-rich, industry-leading companies is a great way to play AI trends in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies are at the heart of the AI revolution. When it comes to the advanced GPUs used to power AI applications, data centers, and other forms of accelerated computing, the semiconductor leader controls roughly 90% of the market. The company has entered an incredible new AI-powered growth phase, and soaring demand made it the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock over the last year.\n\nIn addition to a rock-solid demand outlook for its GPUs, Nvidia is building out its software business and offering AI computing as a service. With its hardware playing a foundational role in pushing AI forward and new business initiatives looking poised to deliver additional sales growth and very strong margins, profits are on track to continue expanding rapidly.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nAI is already powering strong performance for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). This trend is most visible in the company's Azure cloud computing business, with demand for cloud infrastructure services surging as developers launch and scale AI applications. But AI stands to benefit virtually every business under Microsoft's corporate umbrella.\n\nAI is on track to power continued advances for the company's operating systems, productivity software, search business, video games unit, and other businesses. Due to the popularity of its far-reaching product and service offerings, Microsoft also has access to tons of valuable data -- data that can be used to build and improve AI systems. Thanks to the strength of its product and services ecosystem and incredible technology resources, Microsoft stands at the top of the AI software power rankings.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Palantir\n\nFounded in 2003, Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) has had a focus on machine learning and AI technologies for over two decades. Thanks to its ability to gather and analyze valuable data to produce simulations and suggest optimal courses of action, the software specialist has won major contracts with agencies within the U.S. Department of Defense and other government organizations.\n\nThe data analytics specialist has also been rapidly attracting business customers -- and its new AI technologies look poised to power accelerating growth in the private sector. Palantir launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in May 2023. By August, over 100 organizations were using the service. And by November, AIP had a customer base spanning nearly 300 distinct organizations.\n\nWhile Palantir stock has been red hot, rising roughly 160% over the last year, it's still down 57% from its high. For long-term investors, this AI growth stock has the potential to be a massive winner.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nWhile most of Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) revenue comes from its e-commerce business, the large majority of its profits come from Amazon Web Services (AWS). With demand for cloud infrastructure and other tools used to power AI applications poised to surge, Amazon could see sales growth for its most profitable business segment start to reaccelerate.\n\nBut AI will likely also power incredible improvements for the company's e-commerce business. With AI tech paving the way for increased factory automation and autonomous deliveries, margins for the online retail business could see dramatic improvements. If that happens, profits from Amazon's massive e-commerce could soar and power incredible gains for the stock.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike other top tech players, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has big advantages in AI thanks to the breadth of its software offerings and access to massive troves of valuable data. Trading at roughly 21 times expected earnings for 2024, its stock also looks like one of the best value buys in the AI space. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nBetween its market-leading search and mobile operating system (OS) technologies, fast-growing cloud infrastructure business, communication and productivity software, and YouTube streaming platform, Alphabet has many avenues to win in AI. Through its Waymo subsidiary, Alphabet is also a leader in autonomous vehicle technologies and stands to see explosive benefits as AI-powered self-driving tech evolves.\n\nWith multiple ways to profit with AI and its stock trading at non-prohibitive levels, Alphabet is a great pick for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\n\n6. CrowdStrike\n\nThe use of AI technologies to create and deploy cyberattacks could be one of this century's most disruptive trends. Thankfully, top cybersecurity companies are using advanced AI technologies to combat the rising tide of threats.\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is arguably the leader when it comes to AI-powered cybersecurity software, and it's indisputably the leader in its corner of the market. The adaptive technologies offered through its Falcon platform help businesses and institutions prevent breaches of their networks through linked computers, mobile devices, servers, and other hardware.\n\nThe cybersecurity arms race could be one of the most important and most broadly overlooked aspects of the AI revolution. For investors looking to profit from the intersection of these world-shaping trends, CrowdStrike stands out as a top play.\n\n7. Meta Platforms\n\nAI-enhanced content feeds, ad targeting, and cost-saving efficiency initiatives are powering a major resurgence for Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). In the third quarter, the company's revenue rose 23% year over year to reach more than $34.1 billion. Earnings per share jumped 168% in the period, and the social networking leader ended the period with a staggering 3.05 billion users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other platforms.\n\nMeta should be able to score additional AI-driven wins with its content feeds and ad platforms, and it's still in the early stages of monetizing chatbots and using AI to advance its metaverse vision. With its massive global user base, data access, and deep technology resources, the company is in a good position to keep racking up long-term wins.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nasdaq 100 Alert: 7 Undervalued Tech Stocks Ready to Rocket in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 had a banner year. After a disastrous 2022 that saw the tech-laden index lose one-third of its value, it rebounded sharply in 2023 soaring 55% to hit a new all-time high. Of course, most of those gains were because of the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\nSince the index is market cap-weighted the relative size of the companies skewed the results. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone accounts for 9% of the Nasdaq 100 while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents another 8.6%. Together, the seven companies total over 38% of the index. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) called their performance the “defining feature of the equity market in 2023.”\n\nThat means last year’s Nasdaq 100 performance wasn’t very broad-based. It will be difficult for that select group of stocks to repeat their gains this year. Instead, quite a few undervalued tech stocks in the index will soar in 2024. Here are the top seven to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) used to be known as the “backbone of the internet” because of the role its routers and networking equipment played in keeping business online. Today the commoditization of hardware is a challenge. So are the rise of cloud computing and changing IT buying patterns. To address these issues, Cisco is evolving its software, cloud, and security strategy. It aims to transition the majority of its portfolio to everything-as-a-service over time. It calls the move Cisco+.\n\nThe software-focused approach could create large gains for the company in the long run, as it makes its revenue less cyclical, more recurring, and more profitable. It just delivered its strongest fiscal first quarter in company history. Revenue jumped 8% to $14.7 billion while profits raced 36% higher to $3.6 billion.\n\nCisco still needs to demonstrate its value proposition to its customers. By executing on its software, cloud, and security strategy, it can achieve its growth targets and retain its market leadership. With the stock trading at 12 times earnings estimates and 11x free cash flow (FCF), it’s presenting excellent value with tremendous upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nGilead Sciences (GILD) A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiopharmaceutical Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) develops and commercializes antiviral therapies for treating HIV, hepatitis, and cancer. Biktarvy for HIV is its lead drug, generating $3.1 billion in sales globally in the third quarter and $8.7 billion year-to-date. That’s up 17% from last year. A second treatment, Descovey, has $1.3 billion in sales over the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nThese drugs are offsetting the decline of older therapies like Veklury, which was the first FDA-approved antiviral for Covid-19. Although Gilead generated significant revenue from it in 2020 and 2021, sales are rapidly fading.\n\nThere is a dual-edged sword to the potential of its cell therapies Yescarta and Tecartus. On the one hand sales of the treatments are up 35% this year, but on the other the FDA is investigating potential issues with such chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapies. Cancer patients treated with CAR T-cell drugs reportedly developed lymphomas or other malignancies. Gilead operates a new automated CAR T-cell facility that just got FDA approval in April 2022. Fortunately, the therapies aren’t critical to Gilead’s current performance so far, but they are a future growth channel that could be at risk.\n\nThe biotech does have a healthy pipeline of treatments in clinical trials. So long as it can successfully launch and grow its new products, especially in the oncology and inflammatory segments, and leverage its existing portfolio and pipeline to diversify and strengthen its revenue streams, it got potential to rocket higher this year.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) doesn’t make chips itself but makes ion implantation systems that are critical to the chip-making process. It’s part of a duopoly with Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) offering a full range of implant products. Their international competitors don’t have the same breadth of products and services.\n\nThe booming semiconductor industry means there is more than enough business to go around. Axcelis sales jumped 25% so far this year with profits racing 39% higher. While the stock soared 63% in 2023 there’s good reason to believe it can continue climbing.\n\nDue to the heightened demand for electric vehicles (EV), renewable energy, and 5G applications, Axcelis can rapidly expand its share in the silicon carbide power market. It’s the only company with a product line that can deliver complete recipe coverage for all power device applications.\n\nIt also has a diversified customer base, including those for so-called trailing-edge processes. These are older and less advanced technologies still widely used for automotive, industrial, and Internet of Things applications but still have robust demand. Axcelis’ Purion line can support a wide range of implant applications, from 300mm to 200mm and smaller wafers.\n\nDespite its stock gains Axcelis still trades at 15 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its long-term earnings growth rate. There’s no reason it can’t rocket even higher next year.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity specialist Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is benefiting from the inexorable transition of data to the cloud. It provides cybersecurity solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government organizations. The number of security breaches hit record levels before the year even ended. Although the cybersecurity arena is becoming more competitive, Fortinet has several levers it can pull to dramatically increase growth.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI)-based cybersecurity market is expected to grow rapidly because of the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks. Fortinet invested heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities to enhance its threat detection, prevention, and response solutions. There had been a concern enterprise customers would cut back on cybersecurity spending if a recession loomed, but the damage to operations and reputation might prevent that from happening on too broad of a scale.\n\nFortinet can also leverage its Security Fabric platform, which integrates and automates security from network to cloud to endpoint. It says the platform enables customers to achieve higher levels of security, performance, and efficiency, while reducing complexity and costs. It’s also establishing itself as the industry leader in firewalls and software-defined wide area networks, or SD-WANs. It’s an emerging computer networking technology that connects data centers to branches and the cloud.\n\nFortinet’s stock isn’t cheap, but it still has the chance to expand its multiples even more in the year ahead.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had an impressive run in 2023 but should still be considered an undervalued tech stock. It is working to regain its technical edge over Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). New products including Emerald Rapids Xeon processors and Meteor Lake mobile processors aim to restore Intel’s superiority or at least gain technical parity. Similarly its new Gaudi3 AI chip puts Intel in the game with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD.\n\nIntel is also leveraging its chip manufacturing capabilities in the foundry business to provide chip fabrication services to other companies. It counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the U.S. Defense Dept. as clients. The fact that it is primarily based in the U.S. gives it a competitive edge in the wake of global geopolitical uncertainty that’s disrupted supply chains worldwide. It also has a new fab facility in Europe to expand its capacity and meet growing chip demand there.\n\nIntel’s data center business faced challenges in recent years due to increased competition, innovation, and market shifts. However, that is expected to recover. Similarly, the expected debut in 2024 of AI PCs could revive the industry. These are just some of the growth levers available to Intel to pull in 2024.\n\nExpedia (EXPE) Expedia app logo on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline travel stock Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) took a long trip higher in 2023. Shares rose 80% with most of the gains beginning in November on travel demand returning to pre-pandemic levels. Expedia beat analyst profit estimates and recorded record revenue in the third quarter.\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association, overall traveler numbers will exceed pre-Covid levels. They are expected to reach 4 billion in 2024. Passenger volume is projected to hit 9.4 billion passengers worldwide this year, surpassing 2019’s 9.2 billion.\n\nExpedia remains one of the leading online travel companies with well-known brands including its namesake Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, and Egencia. Despite last year’s gains the online travel agency trades at a lower valuation than its peers and its own historical averages. The stock goes for just 12 earnings estimates and 11 times free cash flow. Profit margins and cash flow generation, however, are stronger than some rivals like Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Moreover, Expedia can use platforms like Vrbo to further encroach on territory already held by Airbnb.\n\nLook for Expedia to continue rebounding in 2024 as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic and adapts to the new normal.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo paraphrase Mark Twain, the rumor of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) death has been greatly exaggerated. In fact, Netflix actually won the streaming wars. While competing services like Disney‘s (NYSE:DIS) Disney+ and Paramount Global‘s (NASDAQ:PARA) Paramount+ burst on the scene during the pandemic with great fanfare, they haven’t been able to maintain their momentum.\n\nAnalysts believed movie studios getting into streaming would undercut Netflix ability to survive. Pulling content from the platform for their own streaming services would starve Netflix of content. As it turns out, there really hasn’t been enough of a reason to continue subscribing to these rivals while Netflix is still expanding. It ended the third quarter with 247 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nAlthough it was believed Netflix cracking down on password sharing could damage its business, that’s not the case either. It has an opportunity to grow even more by converting an estimated 100 million users into paying customers. Advertising is another huge opportunity, though CFO Spencer Neumann told Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) says Netflix is still “the crawl of the crawl-walk-run stage” of both growth levers.\n\nNetflix has also shown it possesses superb pricing power. It avoided increasing customer churn by responsibly increasing subscription costs. This is a trio of opportunities the streamer can continue to press to its advantage this year. It’s stock is not the cheapest either, but having survived the streaming wars and come out on top again indicates Netflix is an undervalued tech stock that can keep growing in the year ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Lakehouse Capital, a Sydney-based investment manager, released its “Lakehouse Global Growth Fund” October 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. October was a busy month for the Fund with the team's main attention on several portfolio businesses that released earnings. The Fund returned 0.7% net of fees and expenses for the month compared to -1.1% for its benchmark. Since its inception at the start of December 2017, the Fund has returned 102.7% compared to 67.8% for its benchmark’s, MSCI All Country World Index, Net Total Returns (AUD). In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nLakehouse Capital highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the October 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products and subscriptions. On January 2, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $149.93 per share. One-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 3.74%, and its shares gained 76.10% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a market capitalization of $1.549 trillion.\n\nIn its October 2023 investor letter, Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n\"The Fund’s largest position, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), reported an impressive quarterly result with strong execution and cost discipline driving significant operating leverage across the business. Net sales grew13% year-over-year (11% in constant currency terms) to $143 billion whilst operating income grew 348% to $11.2 billion, well ahead of guidance and analysts' expectations. Growth within their core e-commerce business proved resilient again and management noted that they are continuing to see material productivity and operational benefits from the recent reorganisation of their US fulfilment network. This involved transitioning from one national network to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas.\n\nThe companies second largest segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grew revenue at 12%, a rate consistent with what was achieved last quarter. This was pleasing to see as it signalled that growth is stabilising after several quarters of deceleration driven by customer optimisations. Whilst these customer optimisations are moderating, management noted that they still remain at elevated levels, and hence, they will likely provide a slight (albeit diminishing) headwind for the next few quarters. In any event, we are not concerned as we believe the current headwinds are more a factor of cyclical weakness, as opposed to any fundamental issues. Zooming out, AWS remains the leading cloud provider (in what is an increasingly two-horse race with Microsoft’s Azure) and with 90% of global IT spend still on-premise there is still plenty of runway for future growth.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in second position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 286 hedge fund portfolios held Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of third quarter which was 278 in the previous quarter.\n\nWe discussed Amazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "This article examines the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy for 2024 according to financial media. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Buy for 2024 According to Financial Media.\n\nTech stocks had a great time in 2023, with about 60% gains for the information technology sector and the NASDAQ 100 index due to advancements in artificial intelligence and its speedy incorporation into businesses and daily life. The shares of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have soared by more than three times, whereas the shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have increased by 80% and 60%, respectively. According to the financial media, an AI-related bull run will continue in 2024. This is because businesses from all industries are attempting to use emerging technology to improve their business efficiency or enhance the performance of their products. Forbes predicts that between 2023 and 2030, the global AI market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3%. Morgan Stanley researchers believe that digital products' seamless adoption of AI would shift consumers' gravitation towards online experiences rather than offline ones.\n\nMain Street Research chief investment officer James Demmert, a 30-year investing veteran, predicts a massive rally in AI stocks in 2024 that he believes will last for the next decade. He anticipates the upward trend will continue due to the increased productivity brought about by AI. He stated the following about the AI-related bull run:\n\n\"The market's recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI. Experienced investors know that this kind of broad based strength across all sectors and capitalizations is reminiscent of the first year of previous bull markets that has much further to run, with inevitable corrections along the way. We urge investors not to allow the market's recent strength to scare you out of stocks or prevent you from participating. Adding stocks during any kind of market pullback is the correct strategy at this early stage of the bull market. The fundamentals here are very appealing and likely long-lasting for years not months.”\n\nStory continues\n\nUBS characterized generative artificial intelligence as a potentially disruptive and revolutionary technology in a note. UBS added that the introduction of new technologies has contributed significantly to a wide range of industries in history and that generative AI has the potential to boost the entire economy.\n\n“Stocks have already rallied hard in anticipation of higher AI demand, yet we think companies across the AI value chain from cloud to semis, software, and internet, will further run, both in 2024 and over the longer term. We believe that investors looking for exposure to AI should seek broad exposure across the value chain.”\n\nThe best artificial intelligence stocks to buy for 2024 according to financial media belong to software, cloud computing service providers, and technology behemoths.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Will Change the World (and Make Many Millionaires)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to change the world. It has already sparked an arms race among the world's largest technology companies to provide leading data center infrastructure to their business customers. Plus, enterprises of all sizes are finding new ways to embed AI applications into their everyday operations to boost productivity.\n\nDepending which Wall Street estimate you rely upon, AI could add anywhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy over the next decade. That will create enormous investment opportunities.\n\nSpeaking of enormous investing opportunities, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have created many stock millionaires already for those smart enough (or lucky enough) to buy in on their previous growth. Here's how these two companies could ride the AI boom to mint even more going forward. Image source Getty Images.\n\n1. Oracle\n\nOracle has been one of the most innovative technology companies in the world since its founding in 1977, when it launched its original database management software. Today, it plays a pivotal role in helping companies transition into the digital age. It offers a portfolio of cloud-based applications designed to improve efficiency for dozens of different industries, with the help of automation and AI.\n\nBut investors' attention is currently focused on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which delivers critical computing infrastructure to its business customers so they can design, build, and deploy their own cloud-based applications. However, OCI is now tackling its most lucrative opportunity ever: artificial intelligence.\n\nOracle's data center infrastructure is powered by Nvidia's leading graphics processing chips (GPUs), and it has become a top destination for developers of generative AI applications. Chairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology can train AI models at twice the speed and half the cost of competing clouds. As a result, it has attracted leading AI start-ups like Adept AI, Cohere, and even Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30), Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue came in at $1.6 billion. While that was a small piece of the company's overall $12.9 billion in revenue, it increased by a whopping 52% year over year. Ellison says that pace of advancement will likely continue for years, and if he's right, it means cloud infrastructure revenue will more than double every two years. As a result, it could eventually become a more significant growth driver for the entire company.\n\nBut it might get even better because that growth is hampered by supply constraints right now. Oracle operates 66 data centers, and not only is it expanding them at the moment, but it's also building 100 more. That takes time, and the company also can't get its hands on enough Nvidia chips. In fact, Ellison said Oracle couldn't provide anywhere close to enough GPU capacity for Elon Musk's xAI venture recently, and those circumstances will lead to lost revenue (in the short term).\n\nOracle stock has soared 229,095% since it came public in 1986, so an investment of $440 back then would be worth more than $1 million today. While that pace of growth probably won't be repeated over the next three-plus decades, Oracle is valued at just $290 billion, so it's one of the smallest of the big-tech companies and still has room for significant growth.\n\nWall Street estimates Oracle will deliver $5.55 in earnings per share during fiscal 2024, placing its stock at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19. By comparison, competing AI cloud company Microsoft trades at a forward P/E of 33.5. Oracle stock would have to rise 76% just to catch up, without factoring in any future growth.\n\nOver the long term, it's conceivable Oracle's fast-growing presence in AI will give it a chance to join its tech peers that sport trillion-dollar market capitalizations. It could take a decade (or more) while OCI grows to account for more of the company's total revenue, but it implies its stock could triple from here, so an investor starting with $300,000 today might eventually become a millionaire. Image source: Amazon.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon is an e-commerce pioneer, and online sales are still the company's largest source of revenue despite expansions into cloud computing, digital advertising, and streaming services. E-commerce has had an impact on millions of people; it saves time, it lowers prices because merchants can sell more volume, and it allows consumers to buy products from all over the world.\n\nBut a seismic amount of work happens behind the scenes at Amazon to deliver a great e-commerce experience for customers, and a growing amount of that work is powered by artificial intelligence. Amazon uses AI to learn what customers are likely to buy, creating a highly personalized shopping experience with targeted product recommendations. Plus, Amazon uses over 750,000 AI-powered autonomous robots in its fulfillment centers to speed up logistics, ensuring customers receive their goods in a timely manner.\n\nBut Amazon is also using AI extensively in its industry-leading cloud services platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It developed its own data center AI chips, including the new Trainium2, which is 4 times faster than its predecessor, empowering developers to accelerate the training phase of their AI models. AWS also offers a host of large language models (LLMs) to its business customers, including its own called Titan, as well as third-party models from leading start-ups like Anthropic, in which Amazon bought an equity stake worth $4 billion.\n\nSimply put, AWS offers all the hardware and software businesses need to build AI applications for their own purposes.\n\nThe Amazon story is incredibly attractive from a value perspective. Its stock is part of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of technology giants that outperformed the S&P 500 index by a wide margin in 2023. But Amazon stock is the cheapest of the group by far based on its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. Data source: YCharts.\n\nAmazon is on track to deliver $570 billion in total revenue in 2023 (pending its official Q4 results). That's more than any other company in the Magnificent Seven, yet it trades at less than half the P/S valuation of the next-cheapest stock in the group, Alphabet.\n\nAmazon shares have delivered a 202,486% gain since the company came public in 1997, which means an investment of just $500 back then would be worth over $1 million today. It's unlikely to repeat that rate of growth, but an investor who starts with $200,000 today could join the millionaires' club within the next 20 years so long as Amazon increases its revenue by 8.3% annually (it's on track to rise by more than 11% in both 2023 and 2024, according to Wall Street estimates).\n\nPlus, Amazon stock would have to quadruple just to trade in line with the average P/S ratio of the other six Magnificent Seven stocks, without factoring in any further revenue growth at all.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Oracle wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Not every investor wants to actively monitor the markets and find hidden gems. It can be easier to invest stocks to buy and hold from companies that have vast enterprises, lower risk and plenty of growth potential.\n\nBuying stocks with the intent of holding onto them forever means ignoring the short-term noise and focusing on the long-term opportunities. This strategy can reward investors while allowing them to save time instead of trying to make precise entries and exits into various assets.\n\nThe stock market has a history of helping long-term investors get closer to their financial goals. These three stocks to buy and hold look like enticing opportunities that you may never have to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the largest online advertising platform. Many people rely on Google and YouTube to find information. Advertisers use the traction of both search engines to get in front of potential customers.\n\nAdvertising contributes to the majority of Alphabet’s total revenue. The company generated $76.7 billion in revenue during the third quarter which was an 11% year-over-year increase. Google’s advertising revenue came in at $59.6 billion, which was 77.7% of the company’s total revenue.\n\nAlphabet has successfully diversified into cloud computing which now makes up more than 10% of the company’s total revenue. Cloud computing is growing at a faster pace than advertising revenue and can improve the company’s growth rates and profitability in the years ahead.\n\nAlphabet’s dominance across search and advertising suggest that it is among long-term stocks to buy and hold. It’s a core component of many mutual funds and has delivered steady gains for investors. The stock has gained 57% year-to-date and is up by 164% over the past five years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is another keeper due to its dominance in e-commerce. The tech giant has the largest market cap among e-commerce stocks, and it’s feasible to see the company report $1 trillion in annual revenue within 5 to 10 years.\n\nAmazon recently delivered a 13% year-over-year sales growth which brought revenue to $143.1 billion for the third quarter. Just like Alphabet, Amazon has also adapted to cloud computing and offers Amazon Web Services. AWS sales increased by 12% year-over-year to reach $23.1 billion.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2022 that wiped out a few years of gains, Amazon stock is back in action and has gained 78% year-to-date. Shares trade at a 40-forward P/E ratio.\n\nAmazon doesn’t present the same hyper-growth opportunity it did several years ago. However, the company can still grow at a respectable pace and has the financial flexibility to offer a dividend when it matures. Amazon’s advertising segment can fuel more growth. It was one of the company’s highlights in 2023, and the new Prime Video ads set to debut on January 29th can strengthen that business segment.\n\nVisa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeople will always use credit and debit cards to buy goods and services. These cards are more convenient than pulling out your wallet and looking for change. For online transactions, credit and debit cards are even more convenient.\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) makes money on each transaction that comes from one of its cards. Visa has perfected the art of selling shovels during a gold rush and has become the largest credit card issuer by market cap. The stock’s market cap exceeds $500 billion while the P/E ratio sits at 31. Investors get to enjoy a small 0.80% dividend yield, but that’s not why people buy Visa stock.\n\nThe company regularly reports high-profit margins that exceed 50%. Revenue and earnings growth are also good, as the company generated double-digit year-over-year growth rates for both metrics in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Net income growth accelerated in the fiscal fourth quarter to reach 19% year-over-year growth compared to full-year growth of 15% year-over-year.\n\nThat combination has resulted in a 25% year-to-date gain. Shares have almost doubled over the past five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024 and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Although 2023 was a stellar year for the stock market, volatility has been the name of the game for much of the past four years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began.\n\nWhen volatility picks up on Wall Street, professional and everyday investors have a tendency to seek out companies that offer a history of outperformance. For the past two and a half years, it's stocks enacting splits that have fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn simple terms, a stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact on its market cap or operations. Think of it as a purely cosmetic procedure that can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors (i.e., a forward-stock split), or can increase a publicly traded company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (i.e., a reverse stock split).\n\nWhile there are instances of companies conducting reverse-stock splits and going on to deliver big-time gains for their shareholders (e.g., Booking Holdings), most investors are laser-focused on companies conducting forward-stock splits. That's because forward splits are enacted by high-flying companies that have often out-innovated and handily out-executed their competition.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, nine prominent companies have completed a forward-stock split:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 split Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 20-for-1 split DexCom(NASDAQ: DXCM): 4-for-1 split Shopify(NYSE: SHOP): 10-for-1 split Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 20-for-1 split Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 3-for-1 split Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW): 3-for-1 split Monster Beverage(NASDAQ: MNST): 2-for-1 split Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO): 2-for-1 split NVDA Chart\n\nEvery single one of these businesses is a dominant player with well-defined competitive advantages in their respective industries. For example, Nvidia's graphics processing units are the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Amazon accounts for roughly 40% of U.S. online retail sales, Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, and DexCom is a top-two producer of continuous glucose monitoring systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the individual outlooks for these nine stock-split stocks differs greatly in 2024 (and beyond). Whereas one stock-split stock is historically inexpensive and primed for additional upside, another highflier appears to be headed for a breakdown.\n\nThe stock-split stock to buy hand over fist in 2024: Alphabet\n\nThough all nine of these prominent companies have run circles around the benchmark S&P 500 over the long run, it's Alphabet that stands out as the stock-split stock to buy hand over fist in the new year. Alphabet is the parent company of popular internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.\n\nThe biggest \"problem\" (if you want to call it that) for Alphabet is that it's cyclical. Approximately 78% of the company's third-quarter revenue is derived from advertising. When the slightest hint of trouble is detected by businesses, it's not uncommon for them to quickly pare back their ad spending. This leaves Alphabet susceptible to weakness during recessions. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest an economic downturn is in the cards for 2024.\n\nHowever, this is a two-sided coin that's far from proportionate. Though it's true that recessions are a perfectly normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, only three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months. Further, not a single one has surpassed 18 months.\n\nBy comparison, most economic expansions endure multiple years, with two periods of post-World-War-II growth lasting more than a decade. In short, ad-driven businesses are well positioned to succeed as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nAlphabet's clearest competitive advantage has long been its search engine, Google. In November, Google totaled 91.54% of worldwide search share, according to data from GlobalStats. You'd have to go back to March 2015 to find the last month Google hasn't accounted for at least 90% of global internet search share. Being the undisputed go-to for advertisers wanting to reach users has afforded the company exceptional ad-pricing power in virtually any economic climate. This moat isn't going away in 2024.\n\nThe new year should also feature double-digit growth opportunities for two of Alphabet's fast-growing ancillary segments. YouTube is the second most visited social site in the world, with more than 2.7 billion monthly active users. Rapid growth in Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds) should put ad-pricing power in YouTube's corner.\n\nThere's also Google Cloud, which has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, based on estimates from Canalys, as of the third quarter. Enterprise cloud spending still has a long growth runway, and Google Cloud looks to have made the permanent shift to recurring profitability.\n\nDespite sustained double-digit earnings growth potential over the next five years (if not well beyond), Alphabet stock can be purchased for roughly 14 times estimated cash flow per share in 2024. That's a 20% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the past five years. The Model 3 is Tesla's top-selling sedan. Image source: Tesla.\n\nThe stock-split stock worth avoiding in 2024: Tesla\n\nTo quote the most famous investment disclaimer on Wall Street: \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\" Although EV maker Tesla has made a habit of proving naysayers wrong for more than a decade, it's the clear stock-split stock to avoid in 2024 for a variety of reasons.\n\nBefore digging into those reasons, allow me to give credit where credit is due. As of right now, Tesla is the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's profitable on a recurring basis. While there are other profitable automakers, none of the legacy companies are generating a recurring profit from their electric-only divisions. When Tesla reports its fourth-quarter operating results, I'd expect it to wrap up its fourth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit.\n\nUnfortunately for the world's largest automaker by market cap, its first-mover advantages are beginning to wane, and there are very evident cracks in its foundation.\n\nThe most front-and-center evidence that Tesla is in trouble can be seen via its operating margin, which has been more than halved to 7.6% over the trailing year, ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn 2023, North America's leading EV company slashed prices on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions. Based on comments provided by CEO Elon Musk during the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, these price cuts were based solely on demand. With vehicle inventory levels rising, it's plainly evident that demand for the company's EVs has declined. It also suggests that additional price cuts may be necessary to keep inventory levels under control as Tesla continues to ramp up its production.\n\nAnother potential problem with Tesla is how it's deriving its income. During the third quarter, Tesla booked $554 million in profit from selling renewable energy credits given to it for free by governments. It also generated $282 million in interest income from its sizable cash pile. That's $836 million in pre-tax income -- 41% of the company's pre-tax income in the third quarter -- that can be traced back to unsustainable sources.\n\nAlthough Elon Musk is a big reason Tesla has been such a success since going public in 2010, he's also a genuine liability for shareholders. Putting aside that he's drawn the attention of securities regulators on a couple of occasions, his biggest flaw is that he regularly overpromises new innovations (including new EVs) and fails to deliver them. Tesla's enormous valuation looks to be based on countless promises from Musk that remain unfulfilled.\n\nLastly, Tesla's efforts to become more than a car company have mostly missed the mark. Its ancillary segments generate low margins, while auto margins continue to fall. Whereas most auto stocks trade between 6 and 8 times forward-year earnings, Tesla is valued at 65 times consensus earnings in 2024. That's not a valuation that's going to hold up in the face of a rapidly declining operating margin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

At the same time, the Dow added 0.07%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.64%.\n\nShares of the online retailer witnessed a gain of 4.9% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its gain of 5.05% and outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 4%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Amazon in its upcoming release. On that day, Amazon is projected to report earnings of $0.79 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 276.19%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $166.12 billion, up 11.34% from the year-ago period.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon should also be noted by investors.

        "title": "Wall Street’s 7 Favorite Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "As we enter 2024, it’s wise to pause and reevaluate your investment portfolio, shaking things up for the year ahead. With each new year comes shifting sentiment on Wall Street. However, many top-performing stocks from 2023 could continue gaining momentum this year. Tracking which companies analysts are most bullish on provides useful insight for investors with medium-term investing time horizons.\n\nBig tech stocks often land on analysts’ buy lists, some after already appreciating significantly. While these familiar names may not make you an overnight millionaire, they should anchor your portfolio. I’ll spotlight seven stocks that Wall Street analysts have tagged as hot buys for 2024 based on positive ratings. Note, a reminder: analyst ratings aren’t foolproof market prophecies. However, they do offer a valuable peek into current Wall Street perspectives.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s dive in!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the top dog in the e-commerce sector by a wide margin, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains analysts’ darling pick in this space for 2024. With a stellar 42 “buy” ratings against zero “hold” or “sell” ratings over the last three months, Wall Street is extremely bullish on AMZN stock. I know some may balk at Amazon’s seemingly steep valuation. But with online shopping becoming more ingrained for the consumer (especially among digital-native Gen Zers), I’m willing to pay a premium for this proven winner.\n\nStatistaforecasts nearly 11% annualized global e-commerce growth through 2027, and Amazon should capture much of those dollars. The company’s earnings per share are estimated to grow from $2.69 in 2023 to more than $11.30 by 2032. To me, that long-term profit trajectory justifies Amazon’s current market value, and then some. Paired with low double-digit sales growth expected through 2029, I see ample upside ahead.\n\nBetween Gen Z’s digital preferences and the overall momentum of e-commerce, Amazon’s pole position in this space should equate to big returns over time. This tech titan remains as hungry as ever – a terrific stock to own in 2024 and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlashback to mid-2022 when Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) crashed to $90 per share. Despite the prevalent bearishness at the time, I stayed bullish on this company based on Meta’s rock-solid core business. Fast forward 18 months, and META stock is now trading around $346 per share.\n\nWall Street sees blue skies ahead as well. In fact, Meta nets 36 “buy” recommendations against just one “hold.” From 2023 to 2028, the company’s earnings per share could double on the back of still-robust double-digit annual revenue growth. Indeed, lingering anxiety over Meta’s metaverse dreams has proven temporary. The company’s “Family of Apps” division, not virtual reality, is Meta’s cash cow, and that business is doing just fine.\n\nMeta’s coffers will continue to grow so long as eyeballs remain glued to Facebook and Instagram. Consider Generation Z: though often portrayed as generally being “over” Facebook, most in these age groups still have an account. Additionally, Instagram remains wildly popular with teens. As long as users show up, advertisers will, too. With ample room for untapped global growth, Meta has plenty of upside left.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) retains its spot as a darling among Wall Street analysts, and for good reason. This tech titan scarcely flinched during the recent overall market slide and has rebounded forcefully to fresh highs. While Microsoft’s impressive AI initiatives capture tremendous fanfare, we can’t ignore its breadth across cloud, software, and hardware.\n\nLook no further than Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing segment, for instance. Azure’s revenue popped 29% last quarter. Thus, Microsoft is now encroaching on Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) turf via fledgling search and browser initiatives.\n\nNotably, MSFT stock also has 36 “buy” ratings against just one “hold,” with Wall Street remaining keen on Microsoft, as I am. This company has its hands in so many cookie jars (AI is just one example) that I expect substantial growth ahead. Buckle up for the ride!\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) The Uber logo is displayed on a smartphone on top of a map background.\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of software’s biggest recent success stories, Uber (NYSE:UBER) has surged to new all-time highs in recent weeks. Propelled by robust momentum and an impeccable balance sheet, Uber certainly looks like a juggernaut in the making. It’s no shock that Uber earns 35 resounding “buy” ratings among analysts against just one lone “hold” rating.\n\nNo doubt, Uber’s growth trajectory impresses mightily. The company’s earnings per share could leap from $1.15 in 2024 all the way to $6.61 in 2032, if growth remains on track. However, with 2024 earnings putting Uber’s forward price-to-earnings ratio above 53-times, I concur with that solitary “hold” rating. Despite turbocharged profit growth expected ahead, today’s rich valuation gives me reason to pause. Uber’s forward multiple will sink to around 9-times if everything goes perfectly based on 2032 income projections. But paying upfront for these earnings means investors are forced to assume some pretty significant risk.\n\nUnlike entrenched tech titans, Uber operates within the concentrated rideshare niche and is still working toward mainstream adoption. I believe waiting for a better entry point seems to be the smart play before biting on a stock trading at over 9-times potential 2032 earnings today. Long-term bulls may toss aside my caution and buy regardless, and that I think is not a bad idea if you want to hold for decades.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLooking back to March 2023 when I first touted CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), its blistering growth metrics were undoubtedly mouthwatering. But with its valuation now stretching beyond 85-times forward earnings and 20-times forward sales, I’m balking – even with CrowdStrike garnering 34 “buy” recommendations against just 2 “hold” ratings from Wall Street analysts.\n\nWithout question, cybersecurity industry tailwinds should continue to propel CrowdStrike to new heights over this coming decade. However, paying today’s extremely steep premium seems awfully hard to justify when even the most optimistic 2033 revenue projections still put CRWD stock at almost 3-times next year’s sales. Only the most eager bulls could try rationalizing buying at such current nosebleed levels.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike CrowdStrike, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to bake highly optimistic growth assumptions into its currently lofty valuation. Sure, Nvidia has knocked recent quarterly earnings reports out of the park. But looking ahead, risks definitely loom large, both from AI chipmaking rivals rapidly narrowing the technology gap along with uncertainty permeating the still-emerging and largely unprofitable AI landscape overall.\n\nI believe Wall Street largely overestimates Nvidia’s future prospects, while seriously discounting the competitive and industry headwinds that could plausibly dampen growth. Nvidia earns an overwhelmingly positive 31 “buy” ratings against three mere “hold” ratings. Analysts clearly envisage blue skies dominating ahead. I respectfully disagree with that upbeat prognosis, and suggest prospective investors wait for a better entry point before jumping aboard.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) falls into the same frothy camp. This company has posted stellar market-beating performance in previous quarters, and holds a leadership position in the cybersecurity space. However, PANW stock appears to be priced to sheer perfection. Especially compared to high-flying cybersecurity peer CrowdStrike, Palo Alto’s top-line growth metrics look rather pedestrian moving forward. Yet, PANW stock still trades at remarkably rich earnings multiples, even when looking at 2033 projections.\n\nWith 30 “buy” ratings against just 4 “hold” ratings, Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly endorse Palo Alto Networks. However, I believe waiting for an inevitable pullback should deliver much better risk-reward upside for investors not currently holding this stock. I’d personally replace these cybersecurity picks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) if it weren’t for my basing these picks purely using Wall Street ratings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Can 'Magnificent Seven' continue dominating markets in 2024?",
        "content": "The high-flying 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech stocks that powered markets in 2023 seem poised to extend their leadership in 2024. According to FactSet data, six of the seven including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are projected to rise double-digits this year, with only a negative return seen for Tesla (TSLA).\n\nYahoo Finance's Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So let's stick with the Magnificent Seven here because we know they drove record market gains in 2023. And Wall Street, optimistic the tech giants can keep that momentum going in the new year. According to estimates compiled by FactSet, the Street is projecting the Magnificent Seven stocks will rise an average of 11% in the new year, with the exception of laggard Tesla.\n\nSo as you mentioned, Julia, this is sort of that time of year, you rethink your portfolio maybe a bit. You think you know what, do I stick with the winners, right? And certainly the Magnificent Seven winners in 2023. If you piled in 12 months ago, you're probably feeling pretty good and pretty smart right about now. And there were different reasons those stocks worked last year.\n\nYou could think about AI, certainly these were companies that put so much time and effort and money into that tech, and they began to integrate that tech across their product portfolios.\n\nAnother reason obviously, some investors piled in because they thought they were defensive, right? They saw they were relatively predictable strong moats, strong balance sheets. Warren Buffett likes some of them. He's a pretty smart guy. So now the question is, do you think do you stick with that trade as we head into the new year?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, most strategists are sticking with that trade, at least the individual analysts who cover these stocks, if we look at those price targets, except for Tesla, they're all on average looking for upside here. That said, they're all expecting less upside than we saw last year without exception. All of those Magnificent Seven stocks, if you calculate the change from the close on Friday, last Friday, to the price target, we're talking about a smaller gain than they saw in 2023, or in Tesla's case, a loss.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it is optimism, but it's more muted optimism going into this year. One of the folks who's a macro person, who looks at this is David Costner over at Goldman Sachs. He says the baseline is that mega-cap tech stocks will continue to outperform the remainder of the S&P 500, although it should be said, the forecast for the S&P overall, there's a big range, but most of them are also for modest gains in the index.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: There are some, you know, dedicated tech bulls, though, who are you people are being too conservative. And I think it comes down to where the AI. And they see these companies-- and this is the very bullish case. They see these companies continuing to invest. They're going to keep integrating that tech across their products, across their services, and they just are making a bet that use cases and monetization is going to keep ramping.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. A couple of individual things that I just quickly want to mention that's going on today. One of them is that Apple shares are trading lower. They got an a rating over from Barclays that is pushing the shares down.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Very rare downgrade to sell--\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yes, exactly.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: --the iPhone. But you don't see that very often.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Time for a breather, they say. So we're going to talk more about this later, but you could argue given the size of Apple as Apple goes--\n\nJOSH LIPTON: For sure.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: --the rest of tech, and then the rest of the market goes. So that's definitely weighing on things today. On the flip side, you've got Tesla, which is out with deliveries, we're going to talk more about that later as well. And so even though the forecast is for it to decline on the year, it had been higher earlier today.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Because they beat. They beat consensus.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Now off by 2/3.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: We'll keep watching that one.",

        "title": "Will Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Amazon (AMZN), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis online retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 65.92%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Amazon was expected to post earnings of $0.58 per share, but it reported $0.85 per share instead, representing a surprise of 46.55%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.34 per share, while it actually produced $0.63 per share, a surprise of 85.29%.\n\nWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Amazon. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +29.94% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 3 Hottest Fintech Stocks to Watch in 2024",
        "content": "Financial technology has become the focal point of our economy. Consumers are losing faith in traditional banks and fintech companies are making the most of it. Fintech stocks have shown impressive growth and the potential to deliver solid gains. The companies are leading the way toward digitization and offering an ideal solution to consumers looking to invest, deposit, borrow and shop. There is a noticeable change in how users view the financial system and adapt to the shift in how we handle money. If you are ready to make the most of this shift, here are the hot fintech stocks to watch in 2024.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) Person holding smartphone with website of US financial company Social Finance Inc (SoFi) on screen with logo Focus on center of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past few months, a lot has been written about SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI). Since the resumption of student loan payments, SoFi has become a hot stock. The loan repayment is anticipated to lead to a higher demand for loans, and SoFi will benefit. The growth stock is already up 121% in the year and is exchanging hands for $9.95. But it is one of the hottest fintech stocks with the potential to double in 2024, and buying it below $10 will give you a chance to make the most of the upside.\n\nThis fintech is a financially stable business on the way to profitability. The management expects to report a profit in 2024, and I think it is on the right path. SoFi has maintained the user growth momentum and reported fantastic growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhen smaller, traditional banks struggled, SoFi continued adding users to its business. It saw a rise in customer deposits and ended the third quarter with $15.7 billion. It added 717,000 users in the quarter, and the CEO aims to add at least 1 million new members each quarter in 2024. The fourth quarter results will be interesting and it could give a boost to the stock.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, SoFi seems well-positioned to become a big bank in the coming years, and I am certain it will have an exceptional 2024. This is a millionaire maker stock; getting your hands on it early will mean bigger gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nAffirm (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service provider Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) was trading as high as $164 in November 2021. It has lost a lot of value since but remains a top fintech pick. Trading at $49, the stock is up 440% in the year, and the upward momentum is expected to continue.\n\nConsumers have used BNPL for Black Friday shopping, and I believe the same trend would have continued for their holiday shopping. This will ensure that the company reports an impressive fourth quarter. As consumer spending improves, Affirm is set to benefit. It also has an advantage over other companies because of its partnerships with e-commerce giants.\n\nAffirm already has partnerships with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and has recently entered into a partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT), giving the stock a boost. Consumers can now pay for their purchases at more than 4,500 Walmart locations in installments. At the same time, the company is still unprofitable but ready to disrupt the payment industry.\n\nIn the recent quarter, it generated $446 million in net revenue and reported an operating loss of $244 million. The company will take time to report a profit since it spends a lot of money on marketing and innovation, and it may take several years to reach the breakeven point. However, if it can survive the tough competition, Affirm has a long way to go.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt is too soon to write off PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The company had a tough year, and the stock has dropped 17% in value, but there is much more to come. I believe that improving the economic conditions will help the stock move higher. The company benefited from the loose monetary policy in 2020, and although unable to repeat the performance, it has the potential to move upward. As consumer spending improves, we can see PayPal perform better.\n\nThe company benefits by serving consumers and merchants, which helps it benefit from both networks. PayPal expects to generate 6-7% revenue growth this quarter, and it is investing in initiatives and programs that will bring users to the platform.\n\nThe PayPal Rewards program has already had more than 25 million consumers benefit from the cashback. Further, it also has the PayPal Cashback Mastercard, which has helped increase user engagement and spending on the platform. As and when consumer spending improves, we could see these services gain momentum. The company has a new CEO, a strong balance sheet and a solid history of operations. This will work in its favor in 2024 and we could see the stock breakout.\n\nPYPL stock looks incredibly cheap at the current level of $61, and buying it at this rate will mean massive growth in the coming months. It hit $308 in 2021, and while it is impossible to repeat this performance, we could still see a 50% upside from the current level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Bountiful Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for Income Lovers",
        "content": "Blue-chip stocks to buy for income are somewhat on the back burner at the moment. The Fed is set to loosen interest rates in 2024. The cost of lending is thus set to decrease creating a powerful set of factors for growth shares. In turn, blue-chip shares, more noted for stability than growth, arguably have become less attractive.\n\nYet, blue-chip stocks rarely go out of style. It is never a bad idea to play defensively. If the economy continues to rebound, then an investment will continue to grow, albeit somewhat slower than one in growth oriented firms. If the economy slips up, then blue-chip stocks will really shine. Either way, investors are unlikely to regret investing.\n\nAltria (MO) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’m going to continue to sing the praises of Altria (NYSE:MO) stock into 2024. As blue-chip stocks to buy for income go, buying shares of Altria is very easy to justify. There are many metrics which point to the idea that MO shares are simply a great investment for those looking for income. Yes, Altria is and was a tobacco firm that has to pivot with the evolution of the industry. Growth isn’t as high as it once was but the industry is not dying.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s start with the dividend because that’s going to be the main reason to invest in Altria. As I write this,  MO shares are yielding 9.75%. Altria’s dividend payout ratio is currently 0.78 which is very much in line with where it has been over the past decade. That suggests that there is little reason to believe that Altria is in danger of slashing the dividend in the near future.\n\nAltria’s P/E ratio is also very low at the moment. Investors aren’t as interested in cigarette stocks now as they once were because people simply smoke less. I’d argue that that’s an opportunity. Yes, revenues are declining but Altria is paying investors to stick with it as it figures out how to deliver nicotine based revenues in this new era.\n\nStory continues\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is one of the most balanced blue-chip stocks to buy for income available in the stock market. The company itself is well diversified and positioned to provide growth but also remains reliable at the same time.\n\nNext era energy constitutes two businesses: one, the largest electric utility firm, Florida Power & Light, and the other, NextEra Energy Resources, the biggest wind and solar firm globally. Thus, investors benefit from the steady income provided by a utility firm while also gaining exposure to growth inherent in wind and solar.\n\nThe company anticipates EPS growth in the 6-8% range through the year 2026. Those who choose to invest in NEE shares will receive a dividend yielding more than 3% presently. What’s more, NEE Shares are rebounding and have plenty of room to continue to do so. Utility stocks recently took a beating as bond yields rose to historic highs. Their returns made utility stocks pale in comparison. However, those yields have since fallen back to the 4% level making utility stocks again look attractive. NextEra Energy is one of the best in that class among blue-chip investments.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is pivoting to take advantage of an opportunity that could drastically improve its margins. Meanwhile, it continues to offer one of the most fundamentally strong investment cases, period. In short, there’s a lot to like about McDonald’s and its stock at the moment.\n\nThe pivot I’m referring to of course is CosMc’s. McDonald’s recently opened the spin-off chain which serves a variety of unique drinks and snacks. CosMc’s is currently being tested outside of McDonald’s Chicago headquarters with plans to open 10 locations in Texas in 2024. It’s a clear sign that the company is looking to compete with the likes of Starbucks and cut into their highly profitable drink sales. Further, McDonald’s plans to open 10,000 additional restaurants In the next 4 years, mostly abroad.\n\nThe push to increase its global presence is logical given that international sales increased by 8.8% in the third quarter. That said, domestic sales weren’t far behind, increasing by 8.1%. McDonald’s clearly has a very strong base business. However, it also has a lot of opportunity to both increase its footprint globally and also expand its margins with drinks based sales at CosMc’s.\n\nKimberly-Clark (KMB) Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.\n\nSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com\n\nKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is just about as boring as a company can be. Selling paper products including tissue and toiletries isn’t very interesting to many people. But sometimes boring is good, which is often the case with many defensive stocks.\n\nKimberly-Clark, like so many other firms, has had a tumultuous run over the past few years. The pandemic was initially a boon to the company as consumers flocked to stores to stock up on tissues, toilet paper and other things the company produces. Then supply chain issues and inflation caught up to the company and suddenly it wasn’t as strong as it had been. Again, not an uncommon story during the pandemic.\n\nKimberly-Clark seems to be through the worst of it and the company is expected to increase its EPS by 7% in 2024 after growing rapidly in Q3. The analysts tracking Kimberly-Clark expect that it will provide moderate returns based on share price alone but it also includes a dividend yielding 3.9% presently. That will be enough incentive for many income lovers to buy.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a dividend investor’s dream with strong exposure to growth sectors. The company provides software solutions to the semiconductor industry which is intimately tied to artificial intelligence. Income investors will be very pleased to note that the company increased its dividend by 14% in the third quarter. The stock has recently grown quite quickly but still has room to grow further.\n\nAs strong as Broadcom has been in 2023, 2024 is shaping up to be even better. Broadcom expects that its semiconductor business will grow at mid-to-high single digit rates. The company also expects that its acquisition of VMware will be transformational. The company expects that its revenues will increase by 40% to 50 billion in 2024.  VMware is expected to contribute substantially to that growth.\n\nBroadcom is one of a handful of blue-chip dividend stocks that are well ingrained into the fabric of Silicon Valley. It’s an easy choice for income investors looking for blue-chip stocks to buy for income and reminds me a lot of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) in that regard.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a somewhat unique stock to consider for income lovers. For one, Realty Income pays its dividend on a monthly basis whereas most pay quarterly. Further, Realty Income operates as a triple net Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).\n\nTriple net REITs are operationally unique in that they push certain costs on to the tenant rather than the landlord. That results in lower risks overall. In turn, that makes Realty Income more stable than its competitors. That assertion is substantiated by the fact that the company has increased its dividend for 25 years consecutively. Meanwhile, the dividend yields 5.3% which is attractive but not extreme by comparison with other REITs.\n\nThere’s more to like about Realty Income. The company divested its office space portfolio a few years ago which looks prescient given everything that has happened with firms such as WeWork (OTCMKTS:WEWKQ). 2024 promises to be a better year overall and lower lending costs could propel the firm higher still.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a stock that doesn’t offer a ton of income with a dividend that yields a relatively moderate 1.45%. However, it’s simply one of the biggest and best companies in the world and it deserves investor attention.\n\nIn particular, Walmart is interesting because the company is rapidly adapting to continued growth in e-commerce. Walmart is known to be the biggest physical retailer globally but continues to compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to claw away market share in the e-commerce sector.\n\nWalmart’s overall revenues grew by 5.2% during the third quarter which was a strong result in and of itself. However, its e-commerce growth was substantially higher at 15%. Walmart dominates the world of brick and mortar retail, grocery retail, and is making a substantial push into e-commerce retail. Given its size and resources, it’s difficult to make a logical argument against investing in WMT shares at this point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "How to Find Strong Retail-Wholesale Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises",
        "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Amazon (AMZN) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.03 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 1, 2024.\n\nAMZN has an Earnings ESP figure of 29.94%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.03 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.79.\n\nAMZN is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Best Buy (BBY) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nBest Buy, which is readying to report earnings on March 7, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.51 a share, and BBY is 65 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Best Buy is $2.51, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.25%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMZN and BBY's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "If I Could Only Buy 3 Stocks in 2024, I'd Pick These",
        "content": "Investors have thousands of choices when it comes to stocks to pick. Even when limiting themselves to one subset of stocks, such as the consumer names, investors may still have difficulty boiling down their decision to three top stocks.\n\nNonetheless, some stocks have succeeded at growing market share and driving returns through innovations. They also may create ecosystems that foster virtuous cycles which reinforce the success of their businesses.\n\nThree stocks that have excelled at this are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), and as they continue to serve more customers, investors will likely continue reaping the benefits.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe public knows Amazon best for its unprecedented success on the e-commerce front. Its reach in e-commerce has made it a household name among consumers.\n\nAmazon's financials make it unclear whether that business earns a profit. However, it fosters other revenue streams such as subscriptions and advertising that generated tens of billions in revenue at higher margins.\n\nAdditionally, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment, originally meant to promote e-commerce, inadvertently gave birth to the cloud-computing business. Despite rising competition, it remains the leading cloud-computing company and accounts for most of Amazon's operating income.\n\nThese successes led to $405 billion in net sales in the first nine months of 2023, rising 11% compared with the same period in 2022. Also, slower growth in operating expenses allowed Amazon to return to profitability. The $20 billion in net income is up from a $3 billion loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nAmid such improvements, Amazon stock rose by about 85% in 2023. And despite a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 79, its valuation is close to historical lows over the last few years. As both e-commerce and cloud computing continue to recover, it should bode well for Amazon's growth prospects in 2024.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre operates exclusively in Latin America and, thus, may not be a household name to U.S. investors. Nonetheless, it gave birth to the e-commerce industry in Latin America in the late 1990s and, like Amazon, led to other business segments.\n\nStory continues\n\nLatin America is primarily a cash-based society. Hence, the company formed Mercado Pago to offer fintech solutions to allow cash-based customers to buy online. This enterprise later became a business of its own and evolved into the region's leading fintech company.\n\nLikewise, Latin America offers limited shipping options. The company addressed that by launching Mercado Envios to handle fulfillment and shipping. Mercado Envios and Mercado Pago work separately and together to reinforce each segment and grow MercadoLibre as a whole.\n\nThat ecosystem drove over $10 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2023, a yearly increase of 36%. During this time, MercadoLibre kept general and administrative expense growth in check and reduced its provision for doubtful accounts. This led to $822 million in net income during the nine-month period, well over the $317 million during the same time frame in 2022.\n\nAs investors took notice of such improvements, MercadoLibre rose by almost 90% in 2023. Despite turning profitable just last year, it supports a P/E ratio of 80, a valuation closely approximating that of better-known e-commerce conglomerate Amazon. As MercadoLibre's businesses foster further growth across Latin America, the stock price should continue to rise in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShopify\n\nShopify is in the highly competitive e-commerce-platform business. It stands out for its ease of use and extensive ecosystem. The platform allows entrepreneurs of all sizes, with no coding skills, to build e-commerce sites, and gives them the flexibility to tailor the site's appearance.\n\nMoreover, Shopify's ecosystem provides online sellers with numerous functions essential to succeeding as an online store. To this end, they can more easily process transactions with Shopify Payments or market with Shopify's social media and email-marketing capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, while it can serve entities of all sizes, Shopify Plus enhanced its value to large and high-growth enterprises. Shopify Plus allows for more rapid onboarding and has extra features such as wholesale-channel solutions or the ability to manage sales and inventory.\n\nAdditionally, reversing its plans to build a logistics business relieved Shopify of a tremendous financial burden. Thus, its $4.9 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 surged 27% higher. And while Shopify lost $525 million during that time frame, it suffered a $1.3 billion impairment charge from the sale of the logistics business that led to the loss.\n\nFurthermore, Shopify earned $718 million in the third quarter, and with the company again turning a profit, its stock increased by almost 140% in 2023. Although the recent losses leave it without a trailing P/E ratio, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is now at 15, a yearly high. That sales multiple is also low by historical standards, indicating the stock will probably keep moving higher in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's a tall order, especially considering the other six members of the group are:\n\nMicrosoft Apple Alphabet Nvidia Tesla Meta Platforms\n\nThat's a solid lineup of companies to outperform, but Amazon can do it if it accomplishes a few goals.\n\nCloud computing revenue needs to grow\n\nMost people know Amazon as an e-commerce company, but it's a lot more than that. One of the most exciting growth prospects Amazon has had recently is its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS was Amazon's growth engine for many years, as the wide-scale adoption of cloud computing resources boosted it. However, the expansion happened quickly, and many users weren't optimally utilizing the service. When many clients pushed to become more efficient, Amazon obliged and helped them optimize their usage, which often meant cutting resources. This practice hurt Amazon in the short term, as its revenue growth was consistently in the low teens throughout most of 2023.\n\nWhile that practice caused some short-term pain, it was a great strategy to maintain customers for the long term. Additionally, management sees this optimization trend wrapping up. New workloads are coming online, boosting AWS's growth rate throughout 2024.\n\nThis is critical, as Amazon is losing market share in a massive opportunity. At last calculation, Synergy Research Group found that Amazon controlled 32% of the cloud computing market, while Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud controlled 22% and 11%, respectively. With Azure growing at 29% and Google Cloud at 22% in the third quarter (Microsoft's fiscal first quarter aligns with calendar year Q3), each competitor is chipping away at Amazon's lead as it only grew 12% in Q3. However, with the cloud computing market opportunity estimated to be about $1.27 trillion by 2028, there's plenty of market to go around.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS should bounce back in 2024, and if it can match its primary competitor's growth rates, expect the stock to rocket higher in response.\n\nAmazon must sustain margin improvements\n\nAnother positive note for Amazon was its steady profit margin increase in 2023. When CEO Andy Jassy took over from founder Jeff Bezos in the third quarter of 2021, he inherited a bit of a mess, as Amazon had overspent on several growth measures. As a result, profits plummeted. However, Jassy was hyperfocused on becoming more efficient and turning a consistent profit. While this vision took over a year to come to fruition, it's starting to show now. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon's profit margins are climbing to levels previously unreached. Furthermore, even when Amazon had high profit margins, they weren't sustainable.\n\nAmazon in 2024 is much different than the Amazon of 2020 and 2021. Now investors will see in 2024 their first look into what a consistently profitable Amazon looks like.\n\nDespite these gains, Amazon's stock trades at a historically attractive price-to-sales valuation. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nWith Amazon not trading above historical valuations, unlike most members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" plus several tailwinds on its revenue and profits, Amazon looks poised to outperform its peers in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Growth stocks are known for their potential to rapidly increase in value. They come with a risk-reward trade-off, but for investors who can stomach the volatility that typically comes with them, growth stocks can be real moneymakers over time.\n\nThe key is patience.\n\nNot all growth stocks have to be speculative or high-risk, either. Some growth stocks also provide investors with relative stability. If you have $5,000 to invest, the following two growth stocks are great options because of their market-beating potential.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been one of the stock market's quintessential growth stocks for quite some time. A $10,000 investment at its May 1997 initial public offering would be worth over $15.5 million today. You can't ask for much more growth than that.\n\nEven with its generational returns, Amazon is well positioned to continue growing at a good rate. Of course, its e-commerce business made it a household name, but Amazon has its hand in several industries that are still growing, including artificial intelligence, healthcare, and cloud services.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's true moneymaker, accounting for most of its profit. AWS is the leading cloud service provider, with a 31% market share as of the third quarter of 2023. That's a 1% drop from recent quarters, but I don't believe that's a cause for concern.\n\nThe cloud computing market is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 17.8% from 2023 to 2032, according to Acumen Research and Consulting. Even growing at that rate could expand AWS and boost Amazon's profits. AMZN Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon Prime Video could be an underrated growth area for Amazon. Although it has been around since September 2006, recent moves such as buying the rights to the NFL's Thursday Night Football and investing heavily in expanding its original content have put Amazon Prime Video in a competitive position.\n\nAmazon received some backlash when it announced it would begin showing ads on Amazon Prime Video (or you can pay $2.99 per month to avoid ads), but I don't see that having a tangible effect on its growth. Realistically, it was only a matter of time.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving access to your shopping data and then being able to show you relevant ads on Amazon Prime Video is the type of integration that I'm sure Amazon has been seeking. Its e-commerce business could see an assist from the move.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), didn't have the monster year that big tech growth stocks such as Nvidia or Amazon had, but you can't beat 58% returns in a year.\n\nGoogle advertising is undoubtedly Alphabet's most important business, accounting for more than 77% of its revenue in the third quarter of 2023. That's less than the 80% it accounted for three years ago, showing that other segments such as cloud and \"Other Bets\" (which includes Waymo) are beginning to pick up steam.\n\nGoogle Cloud has grown impressively, making up 11% of Alphabet's revenue in the third quarter. It's still firmly in third place in cloud service market share (11%), trailing AWS and Microsoft's Azure, but this is a notable increase from its 6% market share in 2017. Much like AWS, Google Cloud should see a boost from overall industry growth in the coming years.\n\nThere's also an argument to be made that Alphabet stock is currently undervalued, especially when you look at the free cash flow the company generates. Its free cash flow outpaces tech giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. This gives Alphabet plenty of cash leeway to invest aggressively in emerging technologies, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase shares. GOOGL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nWith a price-to-free cash flow ratio of around 23.5, Alphabet trades at a significant discount to its peers. There may be legitimate concerns about Alphabet's reliance on Google advertising and antitrust scrutiny, but Alphabet is still positioned to return significant shareholder value for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks the Smartest Investors Are Buying for 2024",
        "content": "The stock market has been unpredictable in recent years, with many companies enjoying immense growth in 2021 amid COVID-19 lockdowns only to lose all they had gained the following year after a macroeconomic-fueled sell-off in 2022. However, easing inflation and excitement over budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) seem to suggest the worst declines are over for now.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite surged 43% in 2023 and looks likely to continue trending up in the new year. Meanwhile, companies that have recently split their shares are attractive investment options, as the move is often followed by significant gains.\n\nSo, here are two stock-split stocks the smartest investors are buying for 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded in recent years, with its shares soaring more than 1,000% since 2018. Stellar growth led management to trigger a four-to-one stock split in July 2021, its fifth split since 2000. And the company appears to just be getting started.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Nvidia emerged as one of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, achieving an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it surpass a $1 trillion valuation before the decade's end.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia has gotten a head start on other chipmakers, supplying its hardware to most of the market. Increased demand for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) has seen the company's earnings soar. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206%, with operating income up more than 1,600% thanks to a spike in chip sales in its data center segment. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. That figure multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 40 yields a potential stock price of $960, projecting growth of 94% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a lucrative role in tech. Its hardware powers multiple sectors, from AI models to cloud platforms, video consoles, laptops, and more. Its solid long-term outlook makes it a stock-split stock too good to pass up for the new year.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has had four stock splits since its initial public offering in 1997, with its most recent one occurring in June 2022 in a 20-to-one split.\n\nThe company has enjoyed immense success over the years by leading two crucial sectors: e-commerce and cloud computing. Online retail on its own is expected to top $3 trillion in 2023 and expand at a CAGR of 10% until at least 2028. Meanwhile, Amazon dominates the industry in multiple countries.\n\nE-commerce hit some roadblocks during an economic downturn in 2022. However, Amazon's recent quarterly results indicate the industry has returned to growth. In Q3 2023, the company posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion.\n\nThe increase was primarily owed to an impressive turnaround in its North America segment, which posted more than $4 billion in operating income after suffering $412 million in losses in the year-ago period.\n\nIn addition to e-commerce, Amazon holds the largest market share in cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS), which it is using to carve out a promising position in AI. The tech giant is heavily investing in the technology, introducing a diverse range of AI tools on AWS over the last year and announcing a venture into chip development. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon has massive growth potential over the long term and is only made more attractive with its price-to-sales ratio of 2.8. The chart above shows the figure is the lowest among some of the most prominent names in tech, suggesting Amazon's stock offers the most value. And with that, the retail giant is a no-brainer investment for 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Better Growth Stock in 2024: Amazon vs. Apple",
        "content": "The new year is here, and there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the next 12 months. 2023 had a tricky start, coming out of a year where the Nasdaq Composite had plunged 33% amid macroeconomic headwinds. However, the situation is much more positive as we begin 2024.\n\nIn 2023, the Nasdaq Composite rose 43%, fueled by easing inflation and excitement over burgeoning sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI). The market will probably continue trending up in the coming months, with now an excellent time to consider investing in companies set up to flourish this year and beyond.\n\nAs titans of their respective industries, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive growth stocks with exciting developments in 2024. Amazon has posted multiple quarters of surging growth in its retail business, while Apple will launch its highly anticipated virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset.\n\nSo let's look at whether Amazon or Apple is the better growth stock in 2024.\n\nAmazon: Delivering a comeback\n\nAmazon has delivered an impressive comeback over the past 12 months after suffering steep declines in its e-commerce business in 2022.\n\nIn its latest quarter, the third quarter of 2023, the company posted 13% year-over-year revenue growth, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, its North American segment exceeded $4 billion in operating income, significantly improving on the $412 million in losses it reported in the year-ago period.\n\nThe tech giant owes much of its growth over the past year to various cost-cutting moves, such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, shuttering unprofitable programs such as Amazon Care, and laying off thousands of people. The restructuring saw Amazon's free cash flow rise 427% over the past year to $17 billion.\n\nAs a result, the company is starting 2024 in excellent form. With lower expenses, it has the funds to fuel its R&D as it continues to expand in AI and overcome potential headwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is leading two crucial markets with its e-commerce and cloud computing services, with its business likely to deliver significant gains for years.\n\nApple: Temporary challenges\n\nApple didn't have it as easy as Amazon in 2023, as an economic downturn led to consumer pullback and repeated declines in its product sales.\n\nFor the fiscal year, the company's revenue fell 3% year over year after its highest earnings segment, the iPhone, saw revenue tumble 2% alongside dips in Mac, iPad, and wearable sales.\n\nHowever, there's reason to believe the current challenges are only temporary, meaning it's still worth investing in Apple. The company has built immense brand loyalty with its users, which resulted in the third largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S. despite offering a significantly fewer products compared to industry leaders Amazon and Walmart.\n\nThe popularity of Apple's products bodes well for its soon-to-be-launched Vision Pro, its first VR/AR headset, which will hit the shelves in 2024. Data from Fortune Business Insights shows the VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has a reputation for entering new markets and quickly rising to dominance, attracting consumers with its focus on quality, connectivity between its devices, and easy-to-use design language.\n\nApple hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Alongside a highly lucrative digital services business, the company remains an attractive growth stock for the new year.\n\nIs Amazon or Apple the better growth stock in 2024?\n\nAmazon and Apple dominate their respective industries and are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon. They have long histories of delivering consistent and significant gains, making them some of the best growth stocks out there. However, just because a company is leading an industry, that doesn't necessarily mean it's trading at the right price. AAPL PS Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart compares both companies' price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, with Amazon's lower figure suggesting its shares are currently the better value. P/S is calculated by dividing a company's total market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. As a result, Amazon's solid performance and financial growth have made it the better growth stock and set it up to be an excellent investment for 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "E-commerce has revolutionized shopping, enhancing the experience and the breadth of selection. Today, the e-commerce share of global retail sales is above 20%. The days of pure brick-and-mortar stores are long gone, and e-commerce retail stocksare taking over.\n\nOver two decades ago, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) began the online retail trend. It pioneered online ordering and delivery, a practice that revolutionized the industry. Gradually, online buying increased, and retailers that couldn’t adapt, such as Sears and J.C. Penny, ended up bankrupt.\n\nToday, most retailers have e-commerce sites and offer delivery services. Some, like Amazon, have gone the extra mile, providing additional convenience through services like same-day delivery. Others are creating engaging content to gamify the shopping experience. This experience includes discounts and prizes that customers can’t ignore.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs the competitive environment heats up, there will be retail stocks and losers. These retail stocks are leading the charge with their out-of-the-box solutions. They have created solutions like livestreaming and same-day delivery that differentiate them from traditional retail stocks.\n\nRetail Stocks Transforming Shopping: Amazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis retail giant has been a dominant force in the retail industry over the past two decades. Through rapid innovation and obsession with the customer, it has crushed retail stock peers. Today, it still leads the e-commerce revolution by delivering the best customer experience possible.\n\nOne major focus in enhancing the customer experience has been delivery times. Over the past two years, Amazon Retail has overhauled its fulfillment network to increase efficiency. It moved from a single national fulfillment network to eight regional fulfillment clusters.\n\nNotably, the company has invested heavily in processes, placement and logistics software, and physical operations. Using a regional fulfillment network means fewer touches and shorter distances. As a result, the company has shortened delivery times, offering customers same-day and next-day delivery services.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, Amazon achieved the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in its 29-year history. Due to the shorter delivery times, more customers are using Amazon. The company has seen increased customer shopping for consumables and everyday essentials.\n\nOver the long term, management expects increased shopping frequency due to quicker delivery. Amazon is innovating and executing on its fulfillment network to increase efficiency and shorten delivery times. These initiatives are working and it’s one of the retail stocks expected to grow revenues in 2024.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) A smartphone displays the Pinduoduo (PDD) website.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), the owner of Pinduoduo, has hit the limelight due to its fast-shopping app, Temu. It has taken the United States by storm and more customers are clamoring for the gamified shopping experience. Moreover, the amazing discounts Temu offers attract frequent shoppers on the platform.\n\nSince PDD Holdings launched Temu in the U.S., the mobile shopping app has seen a meteoric rise. It has rapidly increased gross merchandise volume through aggressive advertising and subsidies. Notably, U.S. spending customers on the platform have surpassed those of Shein.\n\nThe recipe for Temu’s success in the U.S. and other countries is its extremely low prices. For instance, wearable electronics as low as $5. These low prices, plus a wide breadth of products, enhance its competitiveness.\n\nDriven by the rapid growth in Temu, revenues have soared. For instance, in the quarter ended September 30, PDD’s revenues increased 94% YOY. Operating profit was $2.2 billion, a 60% growth from the prior year’s quarter.\n\nTemu is disrupting the e-commerce market, hence PDD is one of the best retail stocks to buy for 2024. It has been undercutting dollar stores like Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) by offering lower prices. Moreover, the gamification of the shopping experience plus prizes for achieving certain objectives will continue to attract shoppers.\n\nAs of this writing, PDD stock is reasonably valued at 24 times fiscal year 2023 earnings. Temu is grabbing market share from discount stores and PDD is one of the top retail stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nSea Limited (SE) The logo for Sea Limited is seen on a web browser through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSingapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is one of the top e-commerce stocks operating in Southeast Asia. Shopee, its e-commerce site, is the largest online retail platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. As competition heats up in the region from TikTok, owned by ByteDance, and Lazada, owned by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), the company has been stepping up its investments.\n\nOne of the major growth markets for Sea Limited has been retail livestreaming. It is increasingly becoming an e-commerce option among sellers, buyers and creators. The company is building its e-commerce content ecosystem as it expects livestreaming to be a large and profitable market.\n\nSo far, the company has increased collaborations and broadened its ecosystem of livestreaming sellers and content creators. Shopee Live is seeing increased participation by both sellers and buyers. For example, 20% of daily active users in Indonesia engaged in live streaming during October. Altogether, the total daily hour streams, the average daily unique streamers, and the daily stream sessions tripled the June numbers.\n\nDuring the Q3 FY2023 earnings call, management reported that livestreaming accounted for 10% of total order volume in Southeast Asia. Key categories such as fashion, beauty and health are benefiting from higher user engagement.\n\nAs Sea invests in opportunities like livestreaming, it has also focused on cost reductions. It is leveraging its significant scale to lower costs and pass on the benefits to sellers and buyers. For instance, in Q3, it reduced its platform logistics costs per order in Asia by 17% YOY.\n\nDue to lower costs, management expects margin improvement in 2024. Additionally, most livestream sales are in higher margin categories like beauty and fashion. Based on the improving margins, Sea Limited can grow earnings. It’s one of the top retail stocks to watch in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors interested in stocks from the Internet - Commerce sector have probably already heard of Prosus N.V. Sponsored ADR (PROSY) and Amazon (AMZN). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nProsus N.V. Sponsored ADR and Amazon are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nPROSY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 3.36, while AMZN has a forward P/E of 56.50. We also note that PROSY has a PEG ratio of 0.07. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.98.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for PROSY is its P/B ratio of 5.08. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AMZN has a P/B of 8.58.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PROSY's Value grade of B and AMZN's Value grade of C.\n\nBoth PROSY and AMZN are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that PROSY is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2024’s Power Players: 7 Stocks Racing to a Trillion Valuation",
        "content": "As it stands now, six U.S.-listed stocks are in the “trillion dollar club,” or stocks with a market cap of at least $1 trillion. In the coming year, or in the years ahead, which other mega-cap stocks (stocks with a market cap of $200 billion or more) will join them and become the next trillion-dollar companies?\n\nThat’s a question on the minds of many investors. Technological breakthroughs in areas like artificial intelligence and electric vehicles point to several companies “joining the club.”\n\nSo, too, do breakthroughs/long-term trends in other areas, like healthcare and financial services. There are also mega-cap companies that, while growing at only a moderate pace, are within reach of hitting the trillion-dollar mark within this decade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, let’s take a look at seven companies that appear most likely to become trillion-dollar stocks and when exactly each of them can reach this milestone.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) What to Expect From AMD Stock Ahead of July's Earnings Report\n\nSource: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to the next chip stock to join Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the trillion dollar club, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a name that to many may first come to mind. Yet, while the chip designer is currently making its own big moves in AI chips, reaching a $1 trillion market cap may be easier said than done.\n\nAMD stock currently has a market cap of around $236 billion. Hence, shares need to surge more than fourfold to join the trillion-dollar club. With AMD rising eightfold over the past five years, quadrupling in price should be a cinch, right?\n\nNot necessarily. Due to this year’s ‘AI mania,’ AMD’s AI catalyst appears to be priced in and then some. Unless the company’s AI endeavors result in earnings many times that of current estimates, even reaching trillion-dollar status by 2030 may be, at best, a stretch.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD may not be on the fast track to becoming one of the next trillion-dollar companies, but another semiconductor firm might be. It is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Why? AVGO is already more than halfway there, with a market cap of $527.2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, as argued previously, AVGO stock may have a far greater runway than other top AI stocks. Valuation is a big reason for this. AVGO trades at a forward multiple in the low 20s. “Magnificent Seven” AI stocks trade for 30-40 times forward earnings.\n\nAlso, Broadcom could eke out billions in cost/growth synergies from its recent VMware merger, enabling the company to beat current earnings growth expectations. To reach a $1 trillion market cap, all AVGO needs to do is rise in value by just under 90%. A mix of multiple expansion and earnings growth could get it there sooner than you think.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) logo, stock trade and chart on smartphone. Business and finance market.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), legendary investor Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle, is even closer than AVGO to reaching the trillion-dollar threshold. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate currently has a market cap of $777.9 billion.\n\nThis means all BRK.A/BRK.B stock needs to do is rise by 28.5% to achieve this valuation goal. Given the mostly “old economy” nature of Berkshire and its various businesses/holdings, not to mention its huge size, you may think that reaching a trillion is, at best, several years away for the company.\n\nHowever, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, the “road to $1 trillion” may not be as long as it seems. Per the commentator, even if growth among Berkshire’s businesses screeched to a halt, adding these stagnant cash flows to the company’s war chest would still justify a move to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nAdmittedly, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) may be the most questionable candidate to become one of the next trillion-dollar companies. Shares in the big pharma firm have surged to a valuation of $522.4 billion thanks to the massive potential of its drug candidate, Zepbound.\n\nWhile initially developed as a treatment for diabetes under the Mounjaro name, Eli Lilly has been working to get Zepbound approved as an obesity treatment. Given Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) success with its Ozempic/Wegovy obesity treatment, it’s no surprise that Wall Street is very bullish on LLY stock.\n\nYet while further positive news regarding Mounjaro/Zepbound may lead to further gains for LLY, with shares trading for 88.4 times earnings, one can argue that the future growth potential of this and other obesity treatments is already priced into the stock. Hence, you may want to tread carefully with this trillion-dollar contender.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The META backed Threads app as a compelling alternative to Twitter. Social media application technology concept.\n\nSource: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a market cap of $919.7 billion, it may be a matter of months, not years, before Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) becomes one of the next trillion-dollar stocks. In fact, as I argued recently, shares in the Facebook and Instagram parent could climb to a value well above $1 trillion during 2024.\n\nPut simply, a combination of earnings growth, further progress with the company’s AI efforts, plus greater appreciation of Meta’s AI bona fides could result in META stock (at around $360 per share today) rallying to $500 or $600 per share.\n\nIn other words, it’s within the realm of possibility that Meta Platforms will become a $1.5 trillion (by market cap) company within a year. That’s a valuation that would put Meta’s valuation in the same ballpark as other trillion-dollar club members like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt may be strange to say that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the next trillion-dollar companies. Mainly because the EV industry leader was, at one point, a trillion-dollar company. In October 2021, just before the 2021-2022 stock market downturn, TSLA attained a market cap exceeding $1 trillion.\n\nThe stock experienced a massive drawdown from late 2021 through January 2023. Following this, a massive rebound throughout 2023. As a result, TSLA stock is back to a market cap of around $804.8 billion. All that’s necessary to send Tesla back to trillion-dollar status is a 24.25% move higher.\n\nEven as Tesla skeptics point to issues like the EV sales slowdown as signs that TSLA will slide lower in 2024, as I pointed out last week, a potential catalyst could supercharge shares later in the year: the debut of a low-priced, mass-market Tesla EV model.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is another mega-cap that’s halfway towards the trillion-dollar market cap mark. Shares in payment technology companies have produced outsized long-term returns for investors since the stock’s debut in the late 2000s.\n\nFollowing an incredible run from a split-adjusted $15-$20 per share in early 2008 to around $260 per share today, some may expect V stock to produce more modest returns from here. However, the move from cash-based to card/digital-based transactions continues. This company also continues to benefit from having a deep economic moat. It is not far-fetched to think that Visa could continue reporting double-digit annual earnings growth in the years to come.\n\nIn short, Visa is one of the “it’s a matter of when, not if” trillion-dollar contenders. With this, plus the stock’s reasonable valuation (26.3 times earnings) compared to growth forecasts, consider making it a long-term buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Investing Preview 2024: Buy These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Avoid the Others.",
        "content": "Any investing exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks has made your 2023 investing year a big success. This group of mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), has outperformed the broader market despite the Nasdaq Composite surging over 45% last year.\n\nIf it's not broken, don't fix it... right? Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023.\n\n1. Nvidia: Buy\n\nNvidia's chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That's pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAI demand doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia's valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That's a PEG ratio of just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023.\n\n2. Apple: Avoid\n\nNot every \"Magnificent Seven\" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple's revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple's business can be cyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That's fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAnalysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta Platforms: Buy\n\nWall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business, harmful privacy changes to iPhones, and expensive metaverse projects that weren't showing any return on investment. Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs, working through the iPhone challenges, and getting revenue growth and profits back on track. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAstonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta is still a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond.\n\n4. Microsoft: Avoid\n\nChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world's largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it's becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillion market cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock's resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn't as appealing as some other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nIt's not abhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop, there are better deals out there. It's OK for investors to be picky.\n\n5. Amazon: Buy\n\nInterestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the past decade, that's over 20% below Amazon's average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing in developing its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That's not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail).\n\n6. Tesla: Avoid\n\nElectric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It's a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla's operating results. Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year. TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it's striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla's future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla's stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy.\n\n7. Alphabet: Buy\n\nAlphabet's dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world's most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock's 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks dominated the market in 2023. The worst performer in the group, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), rose 49%, and the best, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), jumped nearly 240%. But with such strong runs behind them, do any of them have room left to grow in 2024?\n\nThe answer: Yes, and some are still worth buying at their current prices.\n\nApple and Nvidia are both richly valued for their performance\n\nI'm breaking the seven up into buy, sell, and hold groups. Starting with the sell set, I think Apple and Nvidia's stock prices far outpaced their businesses.\n\nNvidia's 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, and its business has responded in kind. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), revenue rose 206% year over year. Furthermore, management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue, up 231%. The stock's movement was warranted given the company's sales growth, but I'm concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\n\nNvidia goes through boom and bust cycles, and right now is certainly a boom. However, it's unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term. If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly, the stock may come crashing back down to earth. Plus, it's trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, Apple is the opposite of Nvidia. Its sales declined throughout 2023. Even so, its stock skyrocketed. This makes little sense, and more headwinds are coming up: a U.S. International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume). With all this in mind, 2024 could be a tough year for the company. And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than \"Magnificent Seven\" members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), it doesn't make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft and Tesla need to show me some results\n\nI view Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently. Microsoft had a strong year, as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose. However, Microsoft trades at a steep premium, even on a forward earnings basis. MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nMicrosoft is executing well, but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying. Still, it's far from a sell.\n\nTesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street, as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products. It's also set to face some added headwinds. Starting in 2024, some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them.\n\nWhen judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock, I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends. For Tesla, these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022. TSLA PE Ratio Chart\n\nI'm taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesn't look like a bargain at these prices.\n\nAdvertising should bounce back in 2024\n\nThat leaves Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category. These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year.\n\nEven though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments, they are mostly advertising businesses. In 2022 and 2023, the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming. However, now that we have lapped that pullback, Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses. Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24%, respectively, in Q3.\n\nNext year should be another strong recovery year for advertising, which will boost both companies.\n\nAmazon has also had a strong 2023, with its margins rising. AMZN Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nHowever, this chart doesn't tell the full story, as this takes into account Amazon's profits over the past 12 months. If you focus on its latest quarterly results, Amazon's margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4, which is usually its strongest one. No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, but 2024 could give us a glimpse, making it a strong buy now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "An Intrinsic Calculation For Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Suggests It's 23% Undervalued",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Amazon.com is US$196 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Amazon.com's US$152 share price signals that it might be 23% undervalued The US$176 analyst price target for AMZN is 10% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$53.7b US$73.4b US$85.2b US$89.6b US$106.7b US$116.2b US$124.2b US$131.0b US$136.9b US$142.2b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x16 Analyst x11 Analyst x3 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 8.89% Est @ 6.89% Est @ 5.49% Est @ 4.51% Est @ 3.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5%  US$49.9k US$63.6k US$68.6k US$67.1k US$74.4k US$75.4k US$74.9k US$73.5k US$71.5k US$69.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$688b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$142b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$2.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8t÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$1.3t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.0t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$152, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.053. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "title": "2 FAANG Stocks to Buy in 2024 and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "The stock market has soared over the last decade. A $10,000 investment made in a market-tracking fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) at the start of 2014 would be worth $29,673 today after having grown at a compound annual rate of 11.6%, assuming that dividends were reinvested along the way.\n\nBut the handful of elite stocks known as the FAANG group has delivered even stronger returns. In the last decade, an equal-weighted and dividend-reinvested portfolio of these five stocks would have grown from $10,000 to $89,051. That's a mind-blowing 24.7% compound annual growth rate. It was a bumpy ride, as the FAANG portfolio outperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracker in five years and underperformed in the other five, but stellar results of 2015, 2020, and 2023 outweighed the weak 2022 period.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with FAANG, I'm talking about these familiar companies:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google.\n\nThe mildest 10-year gain among these top-shelf stocks was 400% for Alphabet. At the other end of the scale, Apple led the way with an 867% share price increase. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker is also the only dividend payer of the bunch; reinvesting those payouts would have lifted an investor's total return on Apple stock to a cool 1,000% in 10 years.\n\nBut even the members of this exclusive club aren't always indisputable buys. Right now, I see two excellent investment opportunities for 2024 in this bunch, but one that investors should avoid until further notice.\n\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 1: Alphabet\n\nThe Google parent took a hard fall in 2022. Both of its dual-class stock types fell by as much as 42% as the company was hamstrung by a rickety global economy and a weak digital advertising market. Overall, Alphabet's stock has gone essentially nowhere over the past two years, posting a loss of 3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, its formerly stalled growth is back in action now. Alphabet's trailing-12-month sales stand at $297 billion today, up from $258 billion in fiscal year 2021. That's 15% higher, in case you prefer to think in percentages. Free cash flow rose from $67 billion to $78 billion over the same period, a 16% increase.\n\nAbove all, Alphabet's future looks bright. The advertising market is coming back from its inflation-induced slump. Google Cloud is a leading provider of cloud-based access to powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and the company even designs its own AI accelerator microchips.\n\nSo Alphabet's stock chart has stalled while the business rekindled its fading growth. These days, Alphabet shares can be had at the modest valuations of 27 times trailing earnings and 23 times free cash flows. These readings stand below their long-term averages, and you know Alphabet will stay relevant in the long run. Ergo, this looks like a great time to scoop up some Alphabet shares on the cheap.\n\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 2: Netflix\n\nIf Alphabet took a bruising in 2022, the market took Netflix behind the woodshed for a proper pummeling. The streaming video pioneer's stock dropped by as much as 72% last year, and despite a strong rebound, Netflix still trades 19% below where it ended 2021. After a brief period when its investment theme was horror story, the company looks more like a wholesome family-friendly feature again, and well worth binge-investing in.\n\nThe thing is, the big drop it took in 2022 never made sense to me. Investors essentially punished Netflix for doing exactly what they had been hoping it would do -- putting a fresh focus on margins and profitable revenue growth. Management's enhanced desire for profitability came at the cost of slower customer growth, which used to be the most essential figure to watch in each of Netflix's quarterly reports. Old habits die hard, and the market's reaction to Netflix's updated strategy was brutal.\n\nNow, Netflix's stock price has approximately tripled from the multiyear low it touched in mid-2021. The most glaringly obvious opportunity to take advantage of the buying window is behind us. Still, Netflix strikes me as a solid buy with reignited growth engines and modest valuation ratios. In particular, Netflix stock is cheaper than ever on a price-to-free-cash-flow basis, which is the exact financial metric the company's critics used to complain about the most.\n\nCash flows may dip somewhat in 2024 as Netflix's content production projects get back on track after the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023, but the long-term trend is clear. Netflix is no longer seeking customers at any cost. Instead, the company is optimizing its cash flows and profits, even at the cost of slower subscriber growth. I'm perfectly fine with that switch, and Wall Street as a whole should eventually embrace it as well.\n\nUntil then, Netflix remains a no-brainer buy in my book.\n\nThe FAANG stock to avoid in 2024: Meta Platforms\n\nI'm not here to throw Meta Platform under the bus, but the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp just doesn't look like a buy right now.\n\nThe company's all-in bet on the metaverse is years away from paying metaphorical dividends. The Reality Labs division's revenues amount to a rounding error in Meta's overall financial structure, clocking in at 0.6% of total sales in the recent third-quarter report. But management is leaning into that potential growth driver with all its might. Those $210 million in third-quarter revenues came at the cost of an operating loss of $3.7 billion for the Reality Labs division.\n\nBut the company exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of this year's four earnings reports and investors see Mark Zuckerberg's business as a promising AI innovator. So the stock has gained 198% in 2023, largely erasing 2022's price drop.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Anders,\" I hear you say. \"Isn't this the same story as Alphabet, which experienced similar share price trends and advertising quirks over the last two years? If you like Alphabet, you should love Meta Platforms too.\"\n\nWell, I see the similarities, but Meta's situation is dramatically different from Alphabet's. The company formerly known as Facebook may have some AI ideas in its holster, but it can't match Google's decades of AI expertise or the AI-infused heft of the Google Cloud service. And if AI is supposed to save Meta from its low-growth morass, the heavy spending on metaverse projects must be viewed as an expensive distraction.\n\nIn sum, Meta Platforms seems like a momentum-powered stock right now, and I'm not convinced that AI will be a game-changer for the company. If and when the broader market reaches the same conclusion, Meta's stock could experience a painful price correction. Until then, I'd rather keep my hands off this overheated social media stock, even if it is part of the market-beating FAANG group.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

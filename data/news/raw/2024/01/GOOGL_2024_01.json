        "content": "For Google and other tech titans, the rise of artificial intelligence remains a big focus for investors as the emerging technology reshapes the tech landscape, transforming the business of search, cloud and advertising, but it also comes with a cost.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet fell more than 7% on Wednesday, a day after the company reported quarterly results. Despite beating expectations on many key metrics, the company said capital spending will jump in 2024 as it continues to invest in AI to improve its services.\n\n\"We do remain very committed to investing in the AI opportunity across Google DeepMind, Google services, Google Cloud,\" Ruth Porat, the tech giant’s chief financial officer, told FOX Business' Susan Li. \"Capex was up in the fourth quarter to $11 billion, and that was overwhelmingly the investment in our technical infrastructure.\"\n\nWILL GENERATIVE AI PAY OFF FOR BUSINESSES IN 2024? There are questions about how AI might affect Google's ad business.\n\nSHOULD BUSINESSES DISCLOSE THEIR USE OF AI? MOST AMERICANS SAY YES\n\nThere are serious questions about how AI could impact Google’s ad business. Advertising remains a powerhouse for Alphabet, accounting for more than 50% of its total revenue. YouTube’s ad revenue grew 16% year over year, but overall ad spending has seen a pullback as advertisers rein in spending.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nAlphabet’s ad revenue for the fourth quarter rose to $65.5 billion from $59 billion in the same period a year ago, just shy of analysts’ estimates, also adding to the selling pressure. Shares are marginally lower this year, compared to the Nasdaq Composite's modest 1% gain.\n\nHowever, Porat says evolving AI technology could contribute to success across Alphabet’s spectrum of services, including cloud computing, which earned its first-ever quarterly profit in 2023.\n\n\"The results reflect spreads across industry sectors; there is an increasing contribution from AI,\" Porat said. \"This is clearly an extraordinary time.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle is expected to release its most advanced generative AI model, Gemini Ultra, later this year.\n\nOriginal article source:Google parent Alphabet sees AI investment providing long-term opportunities",

        "title": "Should Investors Buy the Dip in Alphabet or Microsoft Stock After Earnings?",
        "content": "This week’s earnings lineup is headlined by quarterly results from big tech giants with Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT already reporting after market hours on Tuesday.\n\nDespite exceeding their top and bottom line expectations Alphabet shares were down over -7% today while Microsoft’s stock dipped -2%.\n\nStill, over the last year, Alphabet and Microsoft's stock have soared +41% and +60% respectively and investors may be wondering if today's selloff is a buying opportunity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet Q4 Review\n\nThe drop in Alphabet’s stock comes as the market soured on the company’s underwhelming ad revenue despite fourth quarter earnings of $1.64 per share beating estimates by 2% and soaring 64% from $1.05 a share in the comparative quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQuarterly sales of $72.32 billion came in 2% better than expected as well and spiked 14% from $63.12 billion a year ago. Notably, ad revenue of $65.51 billion slightly surpassed the Zacks Consensus of $65.44 billion although some analysts had loftier expectations as Alphabet bids to keep its position as the leader in total digital advertising revenue in the United States ahead of Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\n\nWith that being said, Alphabet’s ad revenue did rise 11% from $59.04 billion in the prior-year quarter. Rounding out fiscal 2023, Alphabet’s annual earnings were up 27% to $5.80 per share although total sales were down -9% to $256.51 billion versus $282.83 billion in 2022. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft Q2 Review\n\nReporting its fiscal second quarter results, Microsoft’s Q2 earnings of $2.93 per share pleasantly surpassed expectations by 6% and climbed 26% from $2.32 a share in the prior-year quarter. Second quarter sales of $62.02 billion topped estimates by more than 1% and jumped 17% from a year ago. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft attributed the strong quarter to Azure and other Intelligent Cloud Segment services which expanded 20% YoY to $25.88 billion and topped estimates of $25.27 billion by 2%. The company highlighted that it has now moved to applying AI at scale with Microsoft having 53,000 Azure AI customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Wall Street wasn’t blown away by Microsoft’s sales guidance for the third quarter which played a role in today’s dip. Microsoft projects Q3 revenue to be in the range of $60-$61 billion and this does fall in line with the current Zacks Consensus of $60.56 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrent Valuations\n\nWith Alphabet and Microsoft forecasted to have double-digit percentage growth on their top and bottom lines in fiscal 2024, checking their current valuations may give better insight on if now is a good time to buy their stocks. Given their earnings potential checking Alphabet and Microsoft’s P/E valuation is formidable.\n\nAlphabet’s stock certainly looks more attractive in this regard trading at 22.6X forward earnings which is near the S&P 500’s 20.8X while Microsoft's 36.6X is at a higher but not overly stretched premium to the broader market. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nConsidering the strong rally in Alphabet and Microsoft’s stock over the last year the trend of earnings estimate revisions in the following weeks will play a large role in the possibility of more upside. For now, both tech giants land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as their reasonable P/E valuations do support the notion that long-term investors could still be rewarded from current levels.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here is How Billionaire Chris Hohn’s Hedge Fund Beat the Market with 33% Gain",
        "content": "In this article, we take a look at here is how billionaire Chris Hohn's hedge fund beat the market with 33% gain and his top 9 stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of Hohn's investment philosophy, his fund's performance and go directly to Here is How Billionaire Chris Hohn's Hedge Fund Beat the Market with 33% Gain and His Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nFounded in 2003 by billionaire investor Chris Hohn, the TCI Fund Management was up 32.7%  in 2023, recouping a significant chunk of the losses accrued in 2022. The hedge fund was down by about 18% in 2022 as the S&P 500 fell 19% at the height of a ferocious market sell-off triggered by a significant spike in inflation and a push by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.\n\nTCI Fund Management had one of the best years in 2019 as it returned $8.4 billion worth of net gains, providing a 41% return against an average hedge fund return of 10.35%. It returned 14% at the height of the COVID 19 pandemic in 2020. Likewise, it outperformed the overall sector as equity hedge funds gained 6.65% on average in 2023 against its 32.7%, benefiting from solid gains in the technology sector.\n\nHohn founded the hedge fund with his ex-wife, Jamie Cooper Hohn, with the sole aim of transforming the lives of children and adolescents. Consequently, the hedge fund manager donates 50 basis points of the management fees to the fund to help fund various charitable initiatives. In addition, the fund also finances various causes, including climate, sexual & reproductive health, aimed at improving the health and lives of girls all over the world.\n\nTCI Fund Management has been growing in strength since it bounced back from a 43% drawdown amid the global financial crisis in 2008. It has generated, on average, 18% in annualized gain since inception, more than double the return of the S&P 500 index over the same period. The gains have come on Hohn running mostly long only and a very concentrated global portfolio of stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nTCI Fund Management 's performance in 2023 affirmed Hohn's stock-picking skills that have always allowed him to outperform the overall market. The hedge fund has posted profits for 13 straight years through 2021. It only lost money when it went down by 18% in 2022 as its investments in Alphabet and Microsoft turned sour amid a broader sell-off in the tech sectors.\n\nIn 2023, it was a different ball game as TCI Fund Management benefited from its exposure to high-growth stocks that exploded at the height of the bull run. Its biggest holdings were all up by more than 25% for the year, helping propel TCI Fund Management to stellar gains in 2023.\n\nThe hedge fund also benefited from the diversification strategy that Hohn has always relied on to generate returns in the market. Over the years, Hohn has always emphasized investing in various industries, including manufacturers, consumer products companies, and even banks. While the services sector accounts for the biggest share of TCI Fund Management holdings, the fund is also heavily invested in technology and health care. Here is How Billionaire Chris Hohn's Hedge Fund Beat the Market with 33% Gain and His Top 9 Stock Picks\n\nChris Hohn\n\nHohn is also known for his relentless efforts in pushing companies to make strategic changes to improve performance and returns. He occasionally spearheads activist campaigns whenever he believes a stock is trading below its intrinsic value. One of his most recent activist campaigns was at Alphabet, where he penned a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai asking the executive to initiate structural changes in the push to cut back on expenses and reduce headcount.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Hohn’s activist campaign letter prompted Alphabet to embark on a restructuring drive. Concerned by soaring pressure amid artificial intelligence threats mostly spearheaded by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) took drastic changes that involved laying thousands of workers.\n\nThe tech giant also bolstered its investments in artificial intelligence, resulting in the launch of AI-powered chatbot Bard. Amid the efforts, Hohn also pushed Alphabet to consider decreasing salaries as one of the ways of clamping down on expenses as competition for talent in the industry has subsidized significantly.\n\nAirbus is another company that has felt the full brunt of Hohn activists' campaigns. In February of last year, the billionaire investor wrote a letter urging the company to terminate ongoing negotiations over the purchase of a minority stake in Evidian.\n\nWith about $4.3 billion worth of stakes in Airbus, the billionaire reiterated the investment would only be value-destructive. While Airbus shrugged off the activist campaign and went ahead with the deal, it ultimately fell apart amid regulatory hurdles.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nBillionaire investor Hohn is one of the most respected hedge fund managers, having generated solid returns for 13 consecutive years. Likewise, the hedge fund manager is always followed for insights on ideal investment opportunities in the equity markets. After analysing TCI Fund Management 13F filings, we settled on investment plays that allowed billionaire Chris Hohn's hedge fund to beat the market by 33%. The stocks are ranked based on the value of TCI Fund Management equity stakes. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

He attended University of Virginia where he graduated with B.S. Commerce at the McIntire School of Commerce. He obtained his MBA from Stanford University.\n\nKacher is among the famous figures in the hedge fund industry. The hedge fund boss, who chose to base his operations in Silicon Valley rather than Wall Street, learned investing from some of the industry’s greatest.\n\nPrior to starting Light Street Capital in 2010, Kacher worked as managing director at the hedge fund Integral Capital Partners under industry titan Roger McNamee. During his time at Integral, which started in 1998, Kacher oversaw investments in the technology sector. His investment areas of focus included software, internet services and media.\n\nBefore he joined Integral, Kacher worked for the hedge fund Tiger Management under Julian Robertson – a pioneering figure in the hedge fund industry. Kacher went to work for the billionaire legendary hedge fund manager Robertson’s fund after he graduated college with a bachelor’s degree in commerce in 1993 and remained there until 1997.\n\nAt Tiger, Kacher initially worked as a full-time research analyst. At some point, Kacher transitioned to the role of a part-time investment consultant for the hedge fund. During his tenure at Tiger, he focused on investments in hardware, software and networking industries\n\nKacher came to launch Light Street Capital armed with a graduate business degree, years of experience in investing in the technology space and lessons from some of the industry’s best. Kacher’s Light Street Capital is one of the Tiger cubs – hedge funds whose founders had worked at Tiger Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nLight Street Capital is a tech-focused hedge fund headquartered in Silicon Valley – the global epicenter of technology innovation. The firm has $680 million in assets under management. Light Street invests by applying long and short investment strategies.\n\nBeing based in Silicon Valley, Kacher has had a vantage view of the technology space, allowing him to better understand industry trends and spot opportunities ahead of others. In Silicon Valley, the Light Street Capital founder rubs shoulders with technology innovators, startup founders, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.\n\n\"What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry… It seemed crazy to go back to New York.\" Kacher once told Forbes.\n\nThe Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher’s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.\n\nAlso, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.\n\nAs with all other hedge funds, Kacher’s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2017, Light Street’s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.\n\nBut 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia’s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital. Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 15 Picks\n\nGlen Kacher of Light Street Capital\n\nBut the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.\n\nThe AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.\n\nWhile there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.\n\nKacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.\n\nAs to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.\n\nSoftware companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.\n\nAI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology’s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.\n\nApart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.\n\nAmid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.\n\nIn its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.\n\nWith these details in mind, let’s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nLight Street Capital bounced back in 2023 after the rout of technology companies in 2022 wiped out some 70% of the firm’s assets. The hedge fund benefited from its long positions in some extensive tech stocks that exploded amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Consequently, we have analyzed the hedge fund 13F filings and settled on its top stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on Glen Kacher’s hedge fund’s holdings. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nLight Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top Picks\n\n15. Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\n14. Synopsys, Inc.

We trimmed the position as it approached our price target.”\n\n13. Nerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.93 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 22\n\nNerdy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:INDI)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.95 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 25\n\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) is a technology company that provides automotive semiconductors and software solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and electrification applications.\n\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) is benefiting as the digitization of cars rapidly increases thanks to strong demand for electric vehicles and in-cabin infotainment.

Shares fell during the quarter due to investor concerns that near-term automotive semiconductor demand will face headwinds because of excess inventory in the automotive semiconductor supply chain, combined with third quarter revenue guidance that slightly missed consensus expectations due to a customer slightly delaying the launch of a new vehicle model where indie had secured a design win (so delayed, not lost sales). As indie steadily ramps new product and design wins into production, we are confident the company will achieve its targeted model of profitability by year end, while effectively doubling revenues as it delivers on its $4.3 billion and growing strategic backlog. We believe indie has the potential to grow from its $200 million revenue run rate today to its targeted $500 million by 2025 and $1 billion by 2028. In the years ahead, indie should benefit as it develops differentiated, highly integrated, energy-efficient products, while the automotive semiconductor vertical remains highly attractive over the long term.”\n\n11. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.17 Million Number of Hedge fund Holders: 286\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”\n\n10. Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.74 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 23\n\nCellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) is a software infrastructure company that develops solutions for legally sanctioned investigations. Its DI suite of solutions allows users to collect, review, analyze, and manage digital data across the investigative lifecycle concerning legally sanctioned investigations.\n\nCellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) was one of the best-performing stocks in the Light Street Capital portfolio as it rallied by 95% in 2023, outperforming the 24% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nThe hedge fund benefited from the rally, having first bought a stake in Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in Q3 2021 and ended up with stakes worth $15.74 million as of Q3 2023.\n\nFor their Q3 2023 shareholdings, 23 of the 910 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey held a stake in Cellebrite DI Ltd (NASDAQ: CLBT). Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was a remarkable shareholder of Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) with stakes worth $2.26 million.\n\nHere is what Greenhaven Road Capital said about Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)– Cellebrite provides tools to law enforcement to extract data (evidence) from cell phones, analyze the data, and manage the data. Solving many crimes without their tools is inconceivable. They are mission critical. One of the best indicators of business quality is pricing power. The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company’s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their “Premium” offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, “premium” but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading “arms dealer” to collect and review data from mobile phones.\n\nOver the course of the quarter, Cellebrite hired an Executive Chairman from the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners. It will be interesting to see if he can apply any of the “Vista playbook” to Cellebrite operations, and if he can help put some of the $230M+ in cash that Cellebrite has on its books to work via acquisitions. At just over 3x 2024 revenue and profitable, Cellebrite is priced at a significant discount to peers, as if growth will evaporate. I suspect that, over time, growth occurs and multiple expands, or a firm like Vista Equity Partners acquires them.”\n\n9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.79 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 81\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a pioneer electric vehicle company that designs, develops, manufactures and sells zero emission motor vehicles, energy generation and storage systems. . Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s automotive segment is known for electric cars, while the energy generation and storage segment designs, manufactures, and sells solar energy generation and energy storage products.\n\nWhile Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was under pressure late last year, it still finished the year up 123%, helping Light Street Capital return 43%. Nevertheless, the hedge fund trimmed its stakes in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) by 42% in Q3 2023 to $15.79 million.\n\nFor their September quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 81 out of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors. Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the significant shareholder of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) with stakes worth $944.85 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nTsai Capital Corporation, an investment management firm, mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:FROG), up from 27 in the previous quarter.\n\nHere is what Madison Investments said about JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the third quarter, we added two investments to the portfolio (FROG and HAYW). Software provider JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG) sells software tools to the Dev/Sec/Ops space (Development, Security and Operations). Their software forms a critical component of the software development chain. Essentially, large enterprises use FROG’s tools to develop, secure and operate their software infrastructure. We believe J Frog is a very strategic asset that dominates its niche. The company is profitable, with recurring revenues that drive material cash flow, buttressed with a strong balance sheet.”\n\n7. Broadcom Inc.

However, the company’s Cloud division, which is expected to generate growth from selling access to artificial intelligence services, saw its growth rate slow modestly. Juxtaposed with Microsoft’s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google’s stock on the report. While the stock recovered to new highs by the end of the year, the earnings report set back caused the stock to trail behind the S&P 500 with a gain of 6.8% for the quarter.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Best Countries for English Speakers to Work 35 Richest Countries by Median Income 20 Safest Countries for US Travelers in the World\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "12 Highest Quality Camera Phones in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will be going through the major smartphone manufacturers who have introduced advanced camera phones while covering the 12highest-quality camera phones in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Highest Quality Camera Phones in 2024.\n\nAn Era of Innovation\n\nMobile upgrades are becoming increasingly influenced by camera features. This has motivated smartphone companies to include high-end camera technology in portable designs. 2024 has just begun with the launch of Galaxy S24 Ultra, the latest flagship smartphone from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF). This camera phone has inculcated AI to improve image resolution. A contender to this device is the most recent iPhone 15 series, which debuted in September 2023. While S24 Ultra includes a 200-megapixel main, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto, a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto, and 12-megapixel selfie cameras, iPhone 15 Pro Max features a 48-megapixel main, 12 megapixel ultrawide, 12 megapixels 5x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie cameras. Overall, the Galaxy S24 Ultra has an additional camera and larger dimensions than the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nThe aforementioned rivalry is rather old as the firms continue to fight for global market shares. On January 18, Reuters reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) surpassed Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) by becoming the largest smartphone seller after 12 years. While the iPhone manufacturer secured a market share of 20% by the end of 2023, its rival recorded a 19.4% share. Although Android smartphones from low-end brands such as Transsion and Xiaomi gave competition to Apple, especially in emerging markets, it ended up as the top smartphone brand around the world. Samsung couldn't tap the low-end segment while it was focusing on middle-to-high-end users. The shipments from the brand also decreased during 2023. You can also take a look at iOS vs Android market shares by country to better analyze the dynamics of the competition between Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother prominent player in the smartphone race is Alphabet Inc.'s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). In this regard, the Pixel 8 Pro is the most recent camera phone that the brand has added to its Pixel product line. Notable camera features of the model include astrophotography, motion autofocus, and dual exposure controls. The three main cameras are also designed to capture more light. The Google Pixel 9 is also expected to be released later in 2024.\n\nLeading Companies in the Smartphone Industry\n\nThe smartphone industry experiences strong rivalry among incumbents. Head-on-head comparisons are made between modern-day camera phones in terms of their features. While some of these phones allow rapidly shareable images, others enable better zooms. Some of the most valuable smartphone companies in the world include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). Let's take a look at some of the most recent technological developments these firms have undertaken.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently advanced in the emerging tech trend of spatial computing. On January 8, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported that Apple Vision Pro will be available in all company stores and online in the US, starting February 2. Pre-orders for this spatial computer began on January 19. Apple Vision Pro has a new three-dimensional user interface which has made navigation easier. Users can move their wrists to scroll and tap their fingers to select. Since the interface allows apps to be displayed without any boundary restrictions, multitasking and collaboration in workplaces will also be convenient.\n\nOn January 30, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) reported that its new Galaxy S24 series is set to tap the global market. The pre-order sales of the series experienced a double-digit rise relative to the previous model once this announcement was made. The company has also incorporated a suite of AI-powered camera tools to enable an improved experience with capturing and editing pictures. Galaxy S24 Ultra, Galaxy S24+, and Galaxy S24 will be widely available from January 31.\n\nSony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is a Japanese conglomerate corporation that sells diverse products including cameras, smartphones and other consumer electronics, and films. Amidst a digital era, the company has been investing in the latest technologies to facilitate its customers.  On January 9, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) reported that it will be supporting 3D content creators through the development of an immersive spatial content creation system. The system includes an XR head-mounted display and a pair of controllers. The launch of the system is expected in the latter part of 2024. Users can efficiently render the textures of 3D objects using the system.\n\nNow that we have taken a look at the major players in the smartphone industry that are contributing to the adoption of camera phones, let’s move to the 12 highest-quality camera phones in 2024.\n\n12 Highest Quality Camera Phones in 2024\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 12 highest-quality camera phones in 2024, we conducted a consensus. Initially, we gathered a list of the highest quality camera phones listed on multiple online vendors such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. We sourced the rating and the number of reviews from the sources for each of the camera phones in our list.\n\nMoving forward, we chose average rating as our primary metric and cumulative number of reviews as our secondary metric. The average rating was calculated by averaging the individual ratings across the sources. Simultaneously, cumulative reviews were found by summing up the individual review count for each camera phone. Hence, the 12 highest-quality camera phones in 2024 were ranked according to their average rating and number of reviews, on a priority basis.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using different consensus approaches, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "title": "The uncomfortable truth about AI’s impact on the workforce is playing out inside the big AI companies themselves",
        "content": "After Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet continued to talk up massive AI investments in earnings calls on Tuesday, we’re past the point of wondering whether the next great tech arms race is upon us. It’s here.\n\nBut this week’s calls are also providing us with a preview of how AI will disrupt the global workforce—starting with the largest AI companies themselves. And for many, it’s looking like an uncomfortable future.\n\nAs these tech giants ramp up spending in AI, both to sell to other companies as well as to help run and simplify their own internal work, they are, at best, slowing hiring in non-AI areas and, at worst, cutting jobs in those divisions.\n\nAlphabet, for example, employed around 182,000 employees at the end of 2023, down from more than 190,000 employees at the end of 2022. And Alphabet layoffs have continued into 2024, with around 1,000 more cuts.\n\nAt the same time, Alphabet’s spending on capital investments increased in 2023 and is expected to grow “notably” larger in 2024.\n\n“With respect to capex, our reported capex in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers,” Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on a call with Wall Street analysts. “The step-up in capex in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers, and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers.”\n\nGoogle’s parent company also appears to be investing in AI capabilities to lower its own costs, with Porat pointing to “streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI” as part of a larger realignment of spending resulting in job cuts and “a much slower pace of hiring.”\n\nTo be sure, Alphabet will continue to hire. But Porat stressed that the hiring focus will be on top technical talent.\n\nAt Microsoft, a laser focus on winning the AI apps and services battle has been accompanied by cutting employees working on areas that are now taking a back seat.\n\nStory continues\n\nA year ago, Microsoft laid off around 10,000 employees, followed by a cut of nearly 2,000 more in its gaming unit this year. Even with new hiring focused on workers with AI expertise, the company had 2% fewer employees at the end of 2023 versus 2022.\n\nAnd just like at Alphabet, the company is making a point to call out heavy future investments in AI.\n\n“We expect capital expenditures to increase materially … driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure,” Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood said.\n\n“Our commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity,” Hood added. “As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team.”\n\nOne translation: As at Alphabet, the safest jobs are those that play a role in the company’s AI ambitions. And that should be noteworthy not only for employees inside both these companies, but across the broader tech industry as well.\n\nDo you have insights or a tip to share?

        "title": "20 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 countries with the largest Jewish population in the world. If you want to skip our discussion on the Jewish community, you can go directly to the 5 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World.\n\nJudaism is one of the oldest Abrahamic, monotheistic religions in the world. It has a rich cultural legacy that goes back thousands of years. The origins of the religion date back over 3500 years in the Canaan region. This area now constitutes Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territory. As of 2023, there are around 16.7 million Jews in the world. This means that Jews make up about 0.2% of the world's population. Compared to other Abrahamic religions like Christianity and Islam, this is quite a small ratio. Christianity and Islam are the two most popular religions in the world, accounting for about 56% of the world's population.\n\nWhile there is only a single Jewish state in the world at the moment, many countries are home to significant populations of Jews. It would be interesting to note that despite being a Jewish state, Israel isn’t the country with the highestJewish population in the world. Israel is home to 7.2 million Jews, accounting for 42.9% of the total Jewish population in the world. The global Jewish population has witnessed a steady growth trend since 1945, with a sharp rise in recent years. Between 2022 and 2023, the community recorded an increase from 15.25 million to 16.78 million people. A 2015 study by the Pew Research Centre predicted that the global Jewish population would reach 16 million by the year 2050. However, the Jewish population has exhibited a faster-than-expected growth rate and surpassed the 16 million mark already, with nearly 25 years remaining until 2050. According to the same study, the annual growth rate for the Jewish population was projected to be lower than the average global growth rate. This prediction proved accurate, as the world Jewish population experienced an annual growth rate of about 0.63% until 2018. In comparison, the average global population grew at a higher rate of 1.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nJewish Demographics in the United States\n\nThe United States of America is also among the countries with the largest Jewish population in the world. New York stands out as the state with the highest Jewish population, at about 1.7 million Jews. This means that New York is home to around 22% of America’s Jews and 10% of the total Jews in the world. California and Florida follow New York with the second and third-highest Jewish populations in the US. These three states have a higher number of Jewish residents than any country in the world, excluding Israel and the US. Meanwhile, Europe is home to about 8% of Jews in the world, with France in the leading position. You can check out the 20 Most Jewish Cities in the World here.\n\nJewish Influence in Major Corporations\n\nDespite making up a small portion of the global population, Jews have historically held positions of power. According to Forbes Israel, there were 267 Jewish billionaires in the world in 2022, with a collective net worth of $1.7 trillion. The majority of these Jewish billionaires hail from the United States. The top 10 billionaires on the list exclusively represented the United States and France, with the first appearance of an Israeli-Jewish billionaire occurring at the 22nd spot. Several business leaders in the United States belong to the Jewish community. Lawrence Ellison, the founder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), a key player in database management systems, stands as a prominent example. Larry Page, another prominent Jewish entrepreneur, gained fame as the co-founder of Google. Similarly, Shari Arison, a highly successful Jewish entrepreneur, is widely recognized as the wealthiest woman in Israel and the owner of Carnival Corp (NYSE:CCL). Arison has diversified her investment portfolio and also holds a 16% stake in Israel's largest bank, Hapoalim. Many of the world’s most prominent companies, including Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:META), and the New York Times (NYSE:NYT), are led by Jewish individuals. Major players in the entertainment and media industry are also affiliated with or owned by Jews. Furthermore, among the top 25 money managers in the history of American Capitalism, an impressive 17 are of Jewish descent. Some of the renowned names within this group include George Soros, James Simon, Steven Cohen, John Paulson, David Tepper, and Carl Icahn.\n\nHere's what Ensemble Capital Management said about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (8.52% weight in the Fund): Google’s earnings report in October showed its core advertising business accelerating to double digit growth as the digital advertising recession of 2022 and early 2023 fades away. However, the company’s Cloud division, which is expected to generate growth from selling access to artificial intelligence services, saw its growth rate slow modestly. Juxtaposed with Microsoft’s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google’s stock on the report. While the stock recovered to new highs by the end of the year, the earnings report set back caused the stock to trail behind the S&P 500 with a gain of 6.8% for the quarter.” 20 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World\n\nSean Pavone/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 countries with the largest Jewish populations in the world, we consulted the Jewish Virtual Library, which is the most comprehensive online repository of data and literature related to Judaism and Jews. The countries have been ranked in ascending order of the size of their Jewish population. We have also shared the percentage of Jews living in the countries in comparison to the total Jewish population in the world.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n20 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World\n\n20.

        "title": "Big Tech earnings are here. Fasten your seat belts.",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported better-than-expected earnings after the bell on Tuesday, but those results weren’t enough for Wall Street, as shares of both companies fell during trading Wednesday.\n\nAnd with Apple and Meta set to report their earnings on Thursday, the pressure is on for the duo to blow away analysts’ expectations if they hope their respective stocks will avoid the same fate.\n\nFor Microsoft, the news was a boon for its artificial intelligence efforts, which the company said contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth to its Azure cloud business. But Wall Street was less than enthusiastic about those results, sending shares lower by more than 1% on Wednesday and dropping the company’s market capitalization below $3 trillion. This is despite the fact that Microsoft topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, faced a harsher reckoning, with shares falling more than 6% on Wednesday. Alphabet took a gut shot after missing expectations for advertising revenue, though it did beat on the top and bottom lines and saw growth in its cloud business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at an event at the Chatham House think tank in London, Monday, Jan. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFor Microsoft, the results seemingly show that Wall Street wants the company to squeeze more revenue out of its multibillion-dollar investments in generative AI technologies. For Alphabet, the market’s reaction points to a need to balance ad revenue growth with its deeper push into the cloud market.\n\nTwo other interesting points from the announcements: Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts on the company’s earnings call that Alphabet’s subscription services, like YouTube TV, Google One, etc., are now a $15 billion per year business. That’s up some five times since 2019.\n\nThe other surprising news came from Microsoft reporting that its gaming division, which now includes Activision Blizzard, is officially its third largest business. The group earned $7.1 billion, ahead of Windows, which took in $5.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple and Meta on deck\n\nMicrosoft and Google’s earnings may have come and gone, but the Big Tech parade keeps on moving, with Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) set to report their earnings on Thursday.\n\nApple’s announcement will help set the stage for 2024, giving Wall Street its first look at full-quarter iPhone 15 sales. Meta, meanwhile, will need to show analysts that its advertising business is continuing to rebound and how it will monetize its massive generative AI investments.\n\nApple’s Q1 earnings are easily its most anticipated in some time. Earlier this month, analysts at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple’s stock on concerns over iPhone sales in China. And on Tuesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released a report on Medium saying that he expects iPhone shipments to decline 15% year over year in 2024. Customers are selecting and buying Apple products at an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 29, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nKuo cited a resurgent Huawei as well as consumer interest in foldable and generative AI-powered phones as reasons for the potential slowdown in China.\n\nShares of Apple were down roughly 2% year to date on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThat early downward trend has cost Apple its spot as the richest publicly traded company by market capitalization. As of Tuesday, the company’s market cap topped out at $2.91 trillion, below new leader Microsoft’s $3.04 trillion market cap.\n\nApple is also in the midst of making major revisions to its App Store in Europe, as it seeks to comply with the EU’s new Digital Markets Act. The moves mean that Apple will open up devices to third-party app stores and cloud gaming services, including Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming.\n\nBut critics, including Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, say the changes are insufficient. In particular, they point to a new 0.50 euro Core Technology fee Apple will charge developers. The charge kicks in after developers record more than 1 million downloads in 12 months and will apply to each subsequent download. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nApple is also gearing up for the launch of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset on Feb. 2. The device, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is the first new product category from the company in nearly a decade, and could provide the company with a powerful new revenue stream. But that’s only if customers can get past the $3,499 price tag.\n\nThe company will need a strong performance in the quarter to justify its stock market performance of late. Shares of Meta are up 33% over the last three months and 164% over the last 12 months. That’s better than the stock performance of Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon over the same period.\n\nMeta is riding high on a rebound in its all-important advertising business after it was kneecapped by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature and a steep decline in the digital ad market thanks to dizzying interest rates.\n\nBut Meta is still hemorrhaging money from its Reality Labs division, which is responsible for its metaverse work and Quest headsets. In Q3, the company reported the segment lost $3.7 billion in Q3 2023 alone. But with Apple’s headset coming shortly, Meta could see a knock-on effect for Quest headset sales.\n\nWe’ll see how this all shakes out come Thursday.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Following Donald Trump’s commanding victories in both the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, coupled with the withdrawal and subsequent endorsement from contenders Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis, the path to the Republican nomination is increasingly pointing towards him. This development places two specific real estate investment trusts (REITs) in a favorable position to capitalize on Trump’s potential comeback to the presidency.\n\nCrown Castle\n\nCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI), offering a significant dividend yield of 5.8%, specializes in cell towers and extensive fiber networks essential for high-speed data transmission and mobile connectivity. With a potential emphasis on infrastructure development under a Trump-led government, Crown Castle’s strategic assets are likely to become even more valuable, as efforts to enhance national communication networks gain priority, potentially driving up CCI’s profitability and appeal to investors.\n\nCrown Castle’s major clients typically include large national wireless carriers, internet service providers, and potentially government entities involved in national security and infrastructure. These clients rely on Crown Castle’s infrastructure to ensure robust, reliable, and extensive coverage for their end-users. In the United States, this includes major telecom companies such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). These companies lease space on Crown Castle’s towers and use its fiber networks for their core operations, from basic voice services to advanced 5G networks.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nEquinix\n\nEquinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), with its dividend yield of 2.1%, stands at the forefront of the data center and interconnection services industry, providing critical infrastructure for cloud computing, data storage, and digital commerce. The company’s global network of data centers could see increased demand in a business-friendly environment, potentially fostered by Trump’s policies aimed at stimulating economic growth and technological innovation. This scenario positions Equinix as a key beneficiary of increased investment in digital infrastructure, making it an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the digital economy’s expansion.\n\nEquinix’s client base spans a wide range of sectors, including financial services, IT, telecommunications, and cloud service providers. Key clients typically include major cloud computing companies (such as Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)), telecommunications giants, and global financial institutions. These clients rely on Equinix’s global platform of high-performance data centers to connect with their customers and partners, as well as to interlink their own distributed infrastructure components.\n\nInvestors considering the impact of a Trump victory in 2024 may find these REITs particularly appealing, not just for their foundational role in supporting digital and communication infrastructure but also for their potential to thrive in a political climate favoring aggressive infrastructure development and technological advancement.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.  Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nImage Credit: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article 2 REITs That Could Skyrocket on Donald Trump's Presidential Bid originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.\n\nCharles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:\n\n''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,\" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.\n\nIn 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nCharles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy\n\nSkylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to \"extrapolate\" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who \"can anticipate change before it is obvious.\"\n\nValue or Growth?\n\nCharles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.\n\n\"It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,\" the fund's website says. Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Skylands Capital's Q3'2023 portfolio and picked its top ten technology stock picks. Why do we pay attention to what hedge funds are doing? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,318,380\n\nSkylands Capital bought a new stake in entertainment and games company Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund's stake in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was valued at $1.3 million as of the end of September 2023.\n\nIn December, Jefferies said it believes the gaming industry will see a slowdown in 2024 as gamers become more selective and prudent with their purchases. Jefferies said at the time that even though Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was expected to post 2025 guidance below expectations, its upcoming games like Battlefield, Sims, Skate and new Star Wars titles will \"re-accelerate topline and drive margin expansion.\"\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA).\n\n9. Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,406,860\n\nIndustrial technology company Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) ranks ninth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital owns a $1.41 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). Over the past one year the stock has gained about 50% in value.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 23 hedge funds had stakes in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) during this period was Chuck Royce's Royce & Associates which owns a $49 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT).\n\nLike Vontier, hedge funds are also investing in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\n8. Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,433,715\n\nSatellite technology company Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) ranks eighth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, owns a $2.4 million stake in Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM). Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a new stock pick of the hedge fund.\n\nIn November, Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) CEO Matthew J Desch bought 28,000 shares of Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) at $37.01 per share.\n\nBaron Growth Fund made the following comment about Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium’s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company’s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium’s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company’s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.”\n\n7. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,612,316\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top tech stock picks of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet since his hedge fund Skylands Capital has a $2.6 million stake in the ecommerce retailer which is also a part of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that have gained a lot amid the AI boom.\n\nUBS recently published a list of quality stocks it believes could outperform in 2024. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was part of the list. UBS said in its note that these Buy-rated stocks are in \"30% top for quality, have positive earnings momentum, are not crowded -- have a crowding data score better than 0.1 -- and have reasonable value without overly high beta.\"\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the most popular technology stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 286 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”\n\n6. SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $4,148,033\n\nSaaS company SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) ranks sixth in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Charles Paquelet. Skylands Capital had a $4.1 million stake in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nEarlier this month, Citi published its Thematic Equity Strategy report in which it named its top picks in major themes. SS&C was its top stock pick in the fintech theme.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC). The biggest stakeholder of SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) during this period was Richard S. Pzena's Pzena Investment Management which owns a $748 million stake in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC).\n\nIn addition to SSNC, Skylands Capital is also invested in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our bottom contributors in Q3 were all from our long book, including HCA Healthcare and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC). SS&C Technologies, a provider of software and services to investment firms, brokerages and other financial institutions, has faced slower organic growth in recent quarters as its business units have produced inconsistent results. Further, rising costs have crimped margins — issues we believe will eventually stabilize but which we are monitoring closely. However, we believe the market is overly pessimistic about the company’s ability to improve its organic growth rate and its margins and are maintaining our position.”\n\nClick to continue reading and seeHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years 10 Best Long-Term Tech Stocks To Buy 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "AI has been at the center of investor hopes for boosting revenues in Big Tech earnings reports. However, following the latest quarterly results, tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Microsoft (MSFT) did not live up to the expected hype around AI.\n\nGoogle's ad revenue missed earnings forecasts, as AI-driven search innovations have yet to translate into accelerated growth. AMD forecasted a weaker-than-expected first-quarter outlook, disappointing investors betting on its AI semiconductor traction.\n\nAnd while Microsoft posted 30% growth for its Azure cloud and AI services, other areas of its business saw more lackluster second-quarter growth.\n\nYahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Bradley Smith break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith",

        "content": "Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) stock sank after the company reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, which missed analysts' expectations on ad revenue, the heart of the tech giant's business.\n\nThe stock slid more than 5% in early trading Wednesday, part of a broad decline for the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC).\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs for the third quarter, was $72 billion versus expectations of nearly $71 billion. That's higher than the $63.12 billion the company generated during the same period in the prior year. But investors seemed to focus on the advertising miss.\n\nThe company reported continued growth in its cloud business, which has grown in importance to investors because of its usefulness in the development of AI. Google Cloud revenue beat expectations, crossing $9 billion, amounting to a 26% jump from a year ago.The company has been pushing to claim additional market share in the cloud computing market, where it currently sits in third place behind competitors Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nHere are some of Alphabet’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs: $72.32 billion vs. $70.97 billion expected ($63.12 billion in Q4 2022) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.64 vs. $1.59 expected ($1.05 in Q4 2022) Cloud revenue: $9.19 billion vs. $8.95 billion expected ($7.32 billion in Q4 2022) Ad revenue: $65.5 billion vs. $65.8 billion expected ($59.04 billion in Q4 2022)\n\nDuring a call with analysts, both CEO Sundar Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat noted the importance of streamlining the business to achieve cost savings and efficiency.\n\n“Across different teams we have wound down some non-priority projects which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas,” said Pichai.\n\nPorat said the company is focused on removing organizational layers to boost efficiency, which has resulted in a slower pace of hiring. But she added that the company will continue to invest in top talent.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe earnings report arrives just weeks after Google laid off hundreds of workers across multiple divisions as the company aims to cut expenses and focus on growth areas, including AI. The tech giant joins several of its peers and others across corporate America that have relied on layoffs to boost efficiency in the wake of significant expansions in the COVID era.\n\nGoogle's executives also responded to concerns that the advancement of AI may disrupt the company's search products since generative AI chatbots change the way people interact with the web.\n\nPichai said that AI tools expand Google's arsenal, which offers a breadth and depth of information to users who crave a diversity of sources online.\n\nGoogle has been widely seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft, which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle has embarked on a host of efforts to both augment its search tools with AI (Bard and Search Generative Experience) and to offer new, advanced large language models, like Gemini.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Why Microsoft, Google, and AMD's stocks are getting hit after big quarters",
        "content": "When you are a stock priced for greatness but only deliver a super good earnings report...sometimes investors will get in a huff.\n\nSuch is the case with the initial crop of earnings from tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). The three stocks (with a combined market cap of $5.2 trillion) were instrumental in powering the broader market to records over the past year, but are getting dinged after reporting earnings late Tuesday.\n\nThe moves are \"signaling some overextension of the recent strong rally,\" said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance.\n\nAt first glance, the negative moves in the stock prices would seem counterintuitive to the average investor who have ridden these tech giants to massive paper gains.\n\nBut here is the deal, as President Biden would put it.\n\nThat average investor probably read the earnings releases of these bellwether companies last night. I’ll say a good percentage of them listened to the earnings calls (which you should be doing!).\n\nBy 7:00pm last night, with a full page of notes, many investors still can’t figure out why these stocks are being swept into downdrafts.\n\nAll three companies showed impressive growth numbers (especially AMD, with data center sales up 38% year over year and a 75% hike to 2024 AI chip sales estimates), hyped the AI train again (a surefire ticket for stock gains last year), and didn’t sound serious alarm bells on the economy.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nThe reality is that none of these quarters were perfect, versus investor expectations of perfection. And believe me, investors have priced in perfection to these stocks: according to Yahoo Finance data, these three stocks trade on an average forward P/E multiple of 35 times. The S&P 500 trades at 22 times, for perspective.\n\nThe vibe coming off these earnings, according to sources, is that growth is good because of the expansion of new AI tools and other businesses, but not mind-blowingly good.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s results unearthed some caution on the economy, pros say.\n\n\"While Microsoft’s F2Q24 top-line results for the two most important businesses (Azure and Office 365 Commercial) were in line to a little better than consensus expectations (and guidance), they were a bit below what our Plausible scenario anticipated, indicating slightly moderating business momentum,\" Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci wrote in a note to clients. FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is seen on the Google house at CES 2024, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 10, 2024. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nGoogle missed estimates for its ad revenue (from Search and Youtube), and its cloud business didn't light it up versus larger rival in Microsoft's Azure.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill noted on Alphabet: \"Strong ad demand drove accelerating, double-digit growth in Search and YouTube, though shy of some investor bogeys. Cloud growth re-accelerated, but remains below Azure.\"\n\nAs for AMD, its gaming chip sales fell 17% from the year prior, and guidance didn't wow the investing masses.\n\n\"This knee-jerk reaction [to tech results] is noise, the AI revolution has started,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me via email.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nBut all in, Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and other members of the Magnificent 7 will have to do better than Microsoft, AMD, and Alphabet to impress investors demanding excellence paired with a side of perfection.\n\nIf they don't, 2024 may go down as the year of the Unmagnificent 7.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "Although many point to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as the best artificial intelligence (AI) investment right now, I'm staying away from it. Because Nvidia is a hardware company, this strength will eventually fade, and investors will be stuck holding a stock valued for a business it no longer has.\n\nInstead, a far better alternative to Nvidia is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google. I've got four reasons why Alphabet will be a much better long-term investment today than Nvidia, and why its business is more sustainable.\n\n1. Alphabet's products are subscription-based\n\nAs mentioned above, Nvidia is a hardware company. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the best in class for AI model training. However, once it sells the GPU, that's it. Unless clients come back to build additional supercomputers or upgrade their system down the line, Nvidia's sales are a one-time benefit.\n\nAlphabet is a massive Nvidia GPU buyer, but it has set up a subscription model using these products. One of Alphabet's most exciting segments is Google Cloud, its cloud computing division. By filling data centers with powerful Nvidia GPUs, clients who need access to extreme computing power can rent it from Alphabet. This allows these clients to stay asset-light and quickly scale up or down according to their needs. Because the revenue stream from this business is recurring, it's far more sustainable.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet has other AI products, like its generative AI model Gemini. This model beats the competition in multiple tests and will create a new revenue stream for Alphabet as it's implemented into various programs.\n\nWhile Nvidia's one-time sales may provide flashy year-over-year growth figures in boom times, they're not as sustainable as Alphabet's subscription-focused approach.\n\n2. Nvidia saw the first wave of AI benefits\n\nBecause Nvidia is a pick-and-shovel play, it saw the first wave of AI demand. With companies like Alphabet ordering thousands of GPUs to outfit their data centers, it experienced a sudden demand rush. It's not advisable to invest in a company in the middle of a demand rush, as many lofty expectations are already baked into the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Alphabet has seen increased demand for cloud computing and generative AI, it's in the early stages. This means the rush hasn't happened for Alphabet yet, making me more excited to get into Alphabet's stock before the big move comes along.\n\n3. Alphabet's stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's\n\nAnother issue with Nvidia's stock is how expensive it has gotten. With Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at a much higher level than Alphabet's valuation, it has a lot of expectations built in. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nAlphabet doesn't have nearly the same hype around its stock and trades at about the same level as the broader S&P 500, which has a forward P/E of 20.\n\nIf Alphabet maintains its status quo, it will still be a market-beating stock. If Nvidia misses expectations, the bottom will fall out of the stock.\n\n4. Alphabet is more balanced if AI fizzles out\n\nFinally, Alphabet is far more diversified than Nvidia. If this AI trend turns out to be a bust (I don't think it will be), then a large swath of Nvidia's business will evaporate. This wouldn't be the first time this has happened to Nvidia, as multiple crypto crashes have caused the company's revenue to drop rapidly when demand fell.\n\nAlthough many investors (including myself) are excited about Alphabet's AI prospects, at the end of the day, nearly 80% of its revenue comes from advertising services. Advertising has been around for thousands of years and likely won't fade away anytime soon.\n\nSo, regardless of how successful AI proliferation is, Alphabet should be fine.\n\nTo me, Alphabet is a much better investment right now than Nvidia. While Nvidia may see strength throughout the rest of 2024, it will likely eventually experience a drop in demand due to its non-subscription business model. If you like roller coasters, Nvidia may be a better stock, although you may never return to the highs you experience early on. But if you like a steady, market-beating ride, Alphabet is a far better pick.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "We're In a New Bull Market. Here Are 5 Brilliant Stocks I'm Buying Hand Over Fist.",
        "content": "As the new bull market kicks off, many investors might wonder which stocks to buy. After all, it's only \"officially\" declared a new bull market once the market reaches new all-time highs. As a result, many stocks are expensive, but not every stock is that way.\n\nI've got five that still look like solid buys right now, and I think investors would be wise to snag this group while they're still fairly valued.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a wide-ranging company. It has multiple AI investments, a cloud computing division (Google Cloud), and other properties like YouTube. But at the end of the day, Alphabet is primarily an advertising company. With nearly 80% of its revenue coming from ads, the ad market must stay strong.\n\nIt showed signs of strength in the third quarter, with ad revenue rising 9.5% -- a significant improvement compared to recent quarters. Advertising market strength is expected to persist throughout the year as the economy shrugs off recession expectations.\n\nThis is part of why analysts expect 11% revenue growth and 26% earnings growth in 2024. As a result, the stock trades for a reasonable 23 times forward earnings (reasonable, at least when compared to other big-tech stocks).\n\nAlphabet's main business is in recovery mode, and with the upside of AI, it could be a strong year for the third-largest company in the U.S. markets.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) was supposed to be ruined by a recession in 2023 or 2024. However, that hasn't happened, and the company has continued to deliver strong results. In Q3, revenue rose 18% to $3.4 billion and produced an impressive $1.3 billion in free cash flow. With nights and experiences rising 14% year over year, it's clear that Airbnb is still a popular choice when traveling.\n\nWith fourth-quarter revenue expected to grow around 13%, it should be another strong quarter when Airbnb reports results. Despite that, Airbnb trades at a fairly cheap price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio when 2024 results are used. Wall Street analysts expect earnings per share of around $8.07 in 2024, pricing the stock at 18 times forward earnings. Considering the S&P 500 trades for a forward P/E of around 20, Airbnb stock looks like a bargain.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. UiPath\n\nUiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a bit of an artificial intelligence (AI) play, as its robotic process automation (RPA) software uses AI to broaden what it can automate. However, it doesn't come with the price tag you'd expect from an AI-related company. UiPath trades for under 11 times sales -- a reasonable level that would still make sense even if it was fully profitable (Airbnb trades at 10 times sales).\n\nUiPath is rapidly growing, too, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) rising 24% year over year to $1.38 billion. While it's nowhere near profitable, it has enacted several improvements to increase its operating efficiencies in pursuit of breaking even. PATH Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\nUiPath provides this group with rapid growth without needing to overpay for it.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is also heavily exposed to the advertising industry. While it has other investments in mixed and virtual reality, the metaverse, and AI, Meta's primary revenue stream comes from its Family of Apps, consisting of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Threads.\n\nAd revenue struggled in late 2022 and into 2023 but dramatically recovered in Q3 by rising 24% year over year. Thanks to this massive revenue boost and operating expenses decreasing, Meta's earnings per share (EPS) shot up from $1.64 to $4.50.\n\nIf it can keep this up throughout 2024, the stock will look dramatically undervalued. With a forward P/E ratio of 22, it still looks like a strong buy at these prices.\n\n5. Visa\n\nLast is Visa(NYSE: V), which recently reported its most recent earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 31). While Visa's revenue growth didn't reach double digits (it grew 9%), its stock buyback program and operational improvements allowed its EPS to increase by an outstanding 20%.\n\nThese results allowed Visa to notch a new all-time high stock price. However, the stock still isn't that expensive. V PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the past decade, you could rarely buy Visa's stock for under 30 times earnings. However, with strong expected earnings growth this year, Visa is hovering around some of the cheapest available levels in recent history. As a result, it's a strong buy in today's markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Together they comprise Magnificent Seven with Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices tanked 6.2%, as the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue forecast and a boosted projection for AI processors by $1.5 billion failed to meet expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther chip stocks Nvidia, Intel, Broadcom and Marvell Technology declined between 1.3% and 2.5%.\n\nAmong other major earnings, Boeing, Mastercard and Phillips 66 are due before market open, while Qualcomm and Align Technology are expected after market close.\n\nAbout 78.5% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings thus far have surpassed expectations, compared with a long-term average of 67%, according to LSEG data on Tuesday.\n\nThe focus was now on the Federal Reserve's first monetary policy decision for this year, at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady.\n\nWith an improved inflation outlook upping the possibility of policy easing sooner than later, investors will be scavenging for any hints on when the first U.S. rate cut might arrive this year, another key element that could determine the fate of the heavily weighted tech and tech-adjacent stocks.\n\nThe ADP National Employment report for January, due before market open, will also be parsed for further insights into the U.S. labor market's strength after the JOLTS report on Wednesday signaled an unexpected rise in December job openings.\n\nAt 6:57 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 51 points, or 0.13%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 24 points, or 0.48%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 203.5 points, or 1.16%.\n\nAmong others, Tesla shed 2.9% after a Delaware judge tossed out Elon Musk's record-breaking $56 billion Tesla pay package.\n\nMondelez International lost 4.5% as price hikes squeezed demand for the Cadbury parent's chocolates and salty crackers, while Thermo Fisher Scientific dropped 2.0% after the medical equipment maker forecast annual profit below estimates.

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) announced its second quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion, beating expectations of adjusted EPS of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion.\n\nThe beats, however, failed to completely satisfy investors, as the stock moved about 1% lower in premarket rading Wednesday.\n\nMicrosoft's all-important cloud revenue topped out at $33.7 billion, beating estimates of $32.2 billion. The company's Intelligent Cloud business, which includes its Azure service, came in at $25.8 billion versus expectations of $25.3 billion. According to the company, AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, increasing from 3 percentage points last quarter.\n\n\"We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.”\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft’s market capitalization over $3 trillion.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.\n\nOn the productivity side of things, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes revenue hit $19.25 billion, just ahead of estimates of $19.03 billion. The company’s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, generated $16.89 billion. Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella during a press event at CES 2024. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) (Ethan Miller via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft’s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot’s more advanced features.\n\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\n\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and, in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\n\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently, as users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, it’s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it’s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Alphabet stock slips after missing expectations on Google ad revenue",
        "content": "Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, missing analysts' expectations on ad revenue, the heart of the tech giant's business.\n\nThe stock slid over 5% lower in premarket trading Wednesday, part of a broad decline for the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs for the third quarter, was $72 billion versus expectations of nearly $71 billion. That's higher than the $63.12 billion the company generated during the same period in the prior year. But investors seemed to focus on the advertising miss.\n\nThe company reported continued growth in its cloud business, which has grown in importance to investors because of its usefulness in the development of AI. Google Cloud revenue beat expectations, crossing $9 billion, amounting to a 26% jump from a year ago.The company has been pushing to claim additional market share in the cloud computing market, where it currently sits in third place behind competitors Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nHere are some of Alphabet’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs: $72.32 billion vs. $70.97 billion expected ($63.12 billion in Q4 2022) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.64 vs. $1.59 expected ($1.05 in Q4 2022) Cloud revenue: $9.19 billion vs. $8.95 billion expected ($7.32 billion in Q4 2022) Ad revenue: $65.5 billion vs. $65.8 billion expected ($59.04 billion in Q4 2022)\n\nDuring a call with analysts, both CEO Sundar Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat noted the importance of streamlining the business to achieve cost savings and efficiency.\n\n“Across different teams we have wound down some non-priority projects which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas,” said Pichai.\n\nPorat said the company is focused on removing organizational layers to boost efficiency, which has resulted in a slower pace of hiring. But she added that the company will continue to invest in top talent.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe earnings report arrives just weeks after Google laid off hundreds of workers across multiple divisions as the company aims to cut expenses and focus on growth areas, including AI. The tech giant joins several of its peers and others across corporate America that have relied on layoffs to boost efficiency in the wake of significant expansions in the COVID era.\n\nGoogle's executives also responded to concerns that the advancement of AI may disrupt the company's search products since generative AI chatbots change the way people interact with the web.\n\nPichai said that AI tools expand Google's arsenal, which offers a breadth and depth of information to users who crave a diversity of sources online.\n\nGoogle has been widely seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft, which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle has embarked on a host of efforts to both augment its search tools with AI (Bard and Search Generative Experience) and to offer new, advanced large language models, like Gemini.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Google down 5%. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nGoogle (GOOG)\n\nGoogle stock was down more than 5% in premarket on Wednesday, after company results revealed revenue in its crucial ad vertical had fallen short of analysts' expectations in its latest financial update.\n\nStock dropped despite it beating revenue estimates from Wall Street. Revenue hit $86.3bn (£68.05bn) versus predictions of $85.3bn. EPS was $1.64, outdoing consensus expectations of $1.59 per share.\n\nThe results highlight the question at the heart of big tech firms which have made their fortunes off tools like search: with search being one of the powerhouses of revenue for the Google-parent, how will the impact of AI play out on margins?\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTech giant Microsoft's second quarter earnings topped Wall Street estimates across the board on Tuesday when it reported after the closing bell.\n\nIt clocked earnings per share of $2.93 – better than the expected $2.78 – while revenue of $62bn beat estimates of $61.14bn.\n\nThe results got a boost from both its personal computing and productivity and business processes units. In the release, chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said: \"We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.\"\n\nMicrosoft's all-important cloud revenue topped out at $33.7bn, beating estimates of $32.2bn. The company's Intelligent Cloud business, which includes its Azure service, came in at $25.8bn versus expectations of $25.3bn. According to the company, AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, increasing from 3 percentage points last quarter.\n\nDespite the beat, its stock was lower in premarket trade, dragging down the Nasdaq.\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nTelecoms giant Vodafone led fallers in the FTSE 100 this morning, dipping more than 4% after news broke that it had rejected a further merger proposal from the Italian Iliad Group to join up the pair's Italian businesses.\n\nThe merger between Iliad Italia and Vodafone Italia would have seen a 50/50 deal, with Vodafone receiving €6.6bn cash and a €2bn shareholder loan.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bid represented a €100m increase from the initial proposal last month.\n\nGSK (GSK.L)\n\nGSK stock was also down 1% by mid-morning in London, even as it upped its outlook, announced a new raft of products and posted a bump in pre-tax profits.\n\nThe group posted a 14% increase in pre-tax profits on a constant currency basis to £6.1bn for 2023 after sales rose 5%.\n\n“We are now planning for at least 12 major launches from 2025, with new Vaccines and Specialty Medicines for infectious diseases, HIV, respiratory and oncology,\" said CEO Emma Walmsley.\n\n“As a result of this progress and momentum, we expect to deliver another year of meaningful sales and earnings growth in 2024, and we are upgrading our growth outlooks for 2026 and 2031.”\n\nIts 2021-2026 outlook for the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of sales is now set at more than 7% and the company expects for adjusted operating profit to more than 11% CAGR.\n\nThe group saw vaccine sales jump 25% in 2023, including £1.2bn of sales of Arexvy – the world’s first approved RSV vaccine for older adults.\n\nWatch: AI stocks slide after Google, Microsoft disappoint</p><p>That was after earnings numbers from big players failed to impress investors. </p><p>Google-parent Alphabet saw its shares drop 5.6% after its ad revenue missed forecasts over the latest quarter. </p><p>It also said spending on data centers would jump, highlighting the cost of staying competitive in AI. </p><p>The technology did help it grow revenue from cloud products, but at a slower pace than arch-rival Microsoft. </p><p>The Windows maker actually beat forecasts for quarterly revenue, as new AI features helped attract customers  to its services. </p><p>But its shares still fell around 1% in extended trade, after it too flagged massive capital costs to come. </p><p>The firm is pouring money into data centers to power chatbots and other products. </p><p>Even so, Wealth Consulting Group Chief Investment Officer Jim Worden says cloud revenue looks like a better bet than retail sales right now: </p><p>“It may be more challenging as consumers perhaps slow their spending.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Tech giants on Tuesday talked up how customers are lapping up their generative AI-powered products, but mounting costs of developing the cutting-edge features irked investors hoping for a big boost to sales from the new technology.\n\nAlphabet shares fell 6%, while those of Microsoft were down about 2% in premarket trading, bringing down heavyweight tech stocks including Apple, Meta and Amazon.\n\nBoth Microsoft and Alphabet reported generous increases to their cloud revenue in the December quarter, beating Wall Street estimates, as customers lined up to test these new AI features and build their own AI services.\n\nBut costs surged as well, highlighting the heavy investments these companies are making in servers, data centers and research as they compete fiercely for new customer dollars.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft's stock drop have put them on track to lose about $59 billion and $56 billion in market value, respectively.\n\nThis underscored elevated investor expectations following a stock rally in recent months, fueled by the promise of AI that has propelled their shares to record highs.\n\nGene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said he is looking for more from his firm's stakes in Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\n\"Investors want to see more contribution from AI,\" he said about Alphabet. \"Microsoft is still nascent, but showing some AI uptick.\"\n\nShares of chipmaker AMD, which boosted its 2024 forecast for AI processors to $3.5 billion on Tuesday, fell 7%. Analysts had previously expected AMD to sell $4 billion to $8 billion worth of AI chips, said Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan, adding the stock's valuation is also pegged to those figures.\n\nAlphabet's capital expenditure in the reported quarter shot up 45% to $11 billion. Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said spending would be notably larger this year than 2023.\n\n\"The only problem here is that Google reported earnings the same night as Microsoft ... (it is) hard to get that AI multiple pixie dust if larger cloud players are growing faster off of larger revenues,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft also reported a 69% jump in capital expenditure to $11.5 billion and said it expects the metric to \"increase materially\" on a sequential basis.\n\n\"By providing a positive outlook ... (Microsoft) gave investors just enough to justify the current share price, but will need to continue to deliver on its growth trajectory in order to justify an even higher share price,\" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.\n\nLuria expects Microsoft to still be able to increase margins based on keeping its overall headcount relatively flat, and investments to come back down next year once Microsoft has enough data center capacity to meet demand.\n\nAlphabet's shares, which rose 58% in 2023, were trading at 22.26 times expected earnings, compared with a forward PE of 33.09 for Microsoft, whose shares were trading at a record high.\n\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin and Max A.

        "content": "By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian\n\n(Reuters) -Nasdaq futures slid over 1% on Wednesday, as tech giants Alphabet and Microsoft's projections for rising AI costs disappointed investors, dragging megacap and chip stocks, ahead of the U.S. policy decision expected later in the day.\n\nAlphabet slumped 5.7% in premarket trading after the company reported holiday-season advertising sales below expectations and projected higher spending this year on items such as servers to power artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft, too, lost 0.9% after forecasting rising costs to develop new artificial-intelligence features that eclipsed a quarterly results beat.\n\n\"In the case of Alphabet, and perhaps Microsoft as well, the market is now getting the jitters that AI investments are going to keep piling up,\" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.\n\n\"These companies have been signaling for a while that investment was needed, but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears until now.\"\n\nThese results and forecasts, coupled with Tesla's growth warning last week, have prompted renewed focus on risks from the outsized weighting of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in the S&P 500 that have collectively pushed the benchmark index to record highs.\n\nApple, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com, set to deliver their earnings on Thursday, fell between 0.4% and 2.6%. Together they comprise Magnificent Seven with Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices tanked 6.2%, as the chipmaker's first-quarter revenue forecast and a boosted projection for AI processors by $1.5 billion failed to meet expectations.\n\nOther chip stocks Nvidia, Intel, Broadcom and Marvell Technology declined between 1.3% and 2.5%.\n\nAmong other major earnings, Boeing, Mastercard and Phillips 66 are due before market open, while Qualcomm and Align Technology are expected after market close.\n\nAbout 78.5% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings thus far have surpassed expectations, compared with a long-term average of 67%, according to LSEG data on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe focus was now on the Federal Reserve's first monetary policy decision for this year, at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady.\n\nWith an improved inflation outlook upping the possibility of policy easing sooner than later, investors will be scavenging for any hints on when the first U.S. rate cut might arrive this year, another key element that could determine the fate of the heavily weighted tech and tech-adjacent stocks.\n\nThe ADP National Employment report for January, due before market open, will also be parsed for further insights into the U.S. labor market's strength after the JOLTS report on Wednesday signaled an unexpected rise in December job openings.\n\nAt 6:57 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 51 points, or 0.13%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 24 points, or 0.48%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 203.5 points, or 1.16%.\n\nAmong others, Tesla shed 2.9% after a Delaware judge tossed out Elon Musk's record-breaking $56 billion Tesla pay package.\n\nMondelez International lost 4.5% as price hikessqueezed demand for the Cadbury parent's chocolates and salty crackers, while Thermo Fisher Scientific dropped 2.0% after the medical equipment maker forecast annual profit below estimates.\n\n(Reporting by Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most profitable blue chip stocks to buy. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, the outlook for 2024, and some recent and crucial developments, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Buy.\n\nWith the first month of 2024 coming to an end, the conflict in the Middle East appears to be a sore thumb in an otherwise roaring stock market and economic climate. While the Federal Reserve can take longer to reduce interest rates, as investors have likely understood during the past couple of weeks, the economy continues to grow and inflation is nowhere near the levels that were in play in late 2022. 2023 has seen a stock market compete with high interest and get some help from the economy along the way as global oil supply chains stabilized and prices at the pump dropped as a result.\n\nHowever, the war in Palestine and the resulting destabilization in the Middle East threatens a vulnerable global economy that has finally started to find some footing after 2022's oil price shocks and high interest rates aimed at culling inflation. In the Middle East, three U.S. service members were killed and dozens were injured due to an unmanned drone attack on a base in northeast Jordan. With the political temperature already high domestically, and conflict rife in Gaza, Lebanon, and Ukraine, the U.S.'s response has everyone on the edge of their seats even though the attack took place on a weekend. The Federal Reserve is also a key body to watch as the year starts, as the tone set by its officials during their January announcements will dictate how well growth and high technology sectors can grow.\n\nThe start of the year is also the time for recollection, and for some investors, the time to adjust portfolios. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite gained 24% and 43% respectively last year, allowing the passive investor following index tracking funds a nice gain to cash out on as the year ended. Now, the question on everyone's mind is whether the markets will sustain their 2023 performance or become even bolder to set new highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst these considerations, there are a multitude of stocks that an investor can choose from. The market is often divided across several categories and sectors, and one of these picks out stocks based on their market capitalization. A market cap sets the tone for a firm in the public's mind, as more valuable companies see both retail and professional investors place a higher premium on a firm's shares. This premium is mostly reflected through fortress income statements that reflect billions (if not hundreds or tens of billions) of dollars in revenue and substantial assets that assure investors that the ability of a company to remain a going concern is not threatened even during some of the most troubling economic environments.\n\nOn the flip side, other stocks such as small cap stocks often do well when the economy is growing since it provides them with the potential to expand operations and increase sales. Balancing a portfolio often requires subjective judgment, and in today's highly connected and fast paced world, a keen monitoring of local and global events to see whether markets as a whole will remain stable or not.\n\nToday, we'll take a look at some of the most profitable blue chip stocks right now. Profit is an important indicator of a stock's financial health since it measures the money that is available for growth reinvesting, retained capital, or dividends if the company is a dividend paying stock. It also shows that financial managers have managed to manage debt and expenses to ensure investor payouts, and provides an analyst comfort that a firm should be able to handle any economic or market headwinds.\n\nSome of the most profitable blue chip stocks on our list are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).

        "title": "Fed decision ahead; Microsoft, Alphabet's AI costs - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures are mixed as investors await a major Federal Reserve interest rate decision and potential commentary on future borrowing costs from the central bank. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) warn that spending on developing their artificial intelligence capabilities will be higher this year, offsetting a strong set of quarterly earnings from the tech giants. Elsewhere, Elon Musk's massive Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pay package worth nearly $56 billion is voided by a Delaware judge.\n\n1. Fed decision ahead\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely tipped to keep interest rates steady following the central bank's latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, meaning any comments from officials around the path ahead for interest rates will be in sharp focus.\n\nBorrowing costs currently stand at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in more than two decades, after the Fed embarked on an aggressive campaign of rate hikes aimed at cooling elevated U.S. inflation.\n\nRecent data has suggested that this tightening cycle may be having the desired effect. While price growth remains above the Fed's stated 2% target, it has continued to show signs of easing back down to this mark. Economic activity has also been resilient, a trend most recently evidenced by a stronger-than-projected advance reading of fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product last week.\n\nThe figures have bolstered hopes that the Fed may be able to defeat inflation without sparking a broader economic meltdown -- a scenario known as a \"soft landing.\"\n\nPolicymakers signaled in December that there could be as many as six rate reductions in 2024, fueling anticipation late last year that a twenty five basis point cut could come as early as March. Yet several Fed officials, wary of reigniting upward pressure on inflation, have since poured cold water on these expectations. Commentary today from the Fed -- and Chair Jerome Powell in particular -- could thus impact how markets see rates evolving in the coming months.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading on both sides of the flatline, as investors looked ahead to the Fed decision and gauged a fresh slate of major corporate earnings.\n\nBy 05:26 ET (10:26 GMT), the Dow futures contract had added 34 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures had dipped by 27 points or 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures had shed 224 points or 1.3%.\n\nThe Fed could finally \"put a pin in the idea\" of an imminent rate cut on Wednesday, said Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analysts at CMC Markets (LON:CMCX), in a note. \"It would be surprising if the Fed were to signal a cut in rates in March although they might well open the door to one on [the second quarter],\" Hewson added.\n\nElsewhere, shares in Microsoft and Alphabet slipped in premarket trading, with Wall Street fretting over the large costs both of the tech behemoths are set to incur in their push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence (more below). More earnings are due out today, including numbers from embattled planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO).\n\nIn the prior session, the benchmark S&P 500 closed lower by 0.1%, but was still just under its all-time high reached on Monday, while a dip in megacap names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dragged down the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite by 0.8%. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%.\n\n3. Microsoft, Alphabet flag AI costs\n\nMicrosoft and Google-owner Alphabet have flagged that they expect capital spending will rise this year as they attempt to bolster their position in the intensifying race to harness surging demand for generative AI.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft told analysts in a post-earnings call that the need to scale its AI infrastructure would cause expenditures to \"increase materially\" on a sequential basis in areas like data centers and servers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood added that Microsoft, who surpassed Apple has the world's biggest company earlier this month, is shifting to an \"AI-first position.\"\n\nAlphabet also said that spending would be \"notably larger\" in 2024, with the YouTube-parent driving to build out its AI offerings at its key advertising and cloud services units. In particular, Alphabet is targeting the launch of an advanced upgrade to its generative AI chatbot, Bard, later this year.\n\nFinance chief Ruth Porat noted that the group sees \"extraordinary\" potential for the applications of AI for users, adding that the technology offers \"long-term growth opportunities.\"\n\nBoth firms posted better-than-anticipated profit and revenues in their most recent quarters, although Wall Street's tepid reaction indicated that doubts remain over whether they can maintain the soaring spending levels needed to deliver generative AI.\n\n\"In the larger picture, the trend for this earnings season is clear: the market wants to see who has enough spending power to dominate the innovation war expected to play out as soon as monetary conditions improve,\" said Thomas Monteiro, Senior Analyst at Investing.com. \"In this case, more than actual [earnings per share], investors want to see improving margins and free cash flows so they can understand that the company will have a shot in the AI arms race.\"\n\n4. Judge tosses out Musk's massive Tesla pay package\n\nA judge in the U.S. state of Delaware has voided tech tycoon's Elon Musk's huge $55.8 billion Tesla pay package, saying that it amounted to an \"unfathomable sum\" that was not fair to shareholders.\n\nThe decision, which tosses out the biggest remuneration offering in corporate America, argued that the directors of the electric vehicle giant appeared to be beholden to Musk's \"superstar appeal.\" The case related to a lawsuit brought by some Tesla stakeholders who believed that the compensation was excessive.\n\nShould the ruling be upheld, Musk would lose options to more than 303 million Tesla shares, or roughly about 10% of the company and well below his previously stated goal of 25% ownership.\n\nShares in Tesla slipped in premarket trading on Wednesday.\n\n5. Crude dips after weak Chinese manufacturing data\n\nOil prices edged lower, as disappointing manufacturing activity data from China, the world's biggest crude importer, dented sentiment.\n\nBy 05:27 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $76.89 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 1.1% to $81.59 a barrel.\n\nOfficial data showed that manufacturing activity in China contracted for a fourth straight month in January, raising further doubts around the strength of the economic recovery of this vital crude market.\n\nThat said, the crude benchmarks are still on course for their first monthly gain since September as broadening Middle East conflicts exacerbated supply concerns over this oil-rich region.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated that crude stockpiles dropped by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 26.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "title": "Google has a surprise moneymaker: people are paying for YouTube, and it’s driving a $15 billion subscriptions business",
        "content": "Search ads are as central to Google's identity as the Big Mac is to McDonalds. But on Tuesday, the tech giant revealed that another business it's been quietly cooking up for years is now delivering big returns.\n\nPaid subscriptions now generate $15 billion in annual revenue, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's quarterly earnings call Tuesday.\n\nPichai credited YouTube for delivering the lion's share of subscriptions growth, thanks to a mix of paid services that includes live television, music, ad-free online content, and live sports.\n\nFor context, Google's subscriptions are delivering more than twice the revenue that Yum Brands, the parent company of fast food purveyors Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut, rang up in 2022.\n\nThe subscription growth is a bit of a shock as the video platform—and parent company Google in general—have historically derived the bulk of revenues from advertisers, rather than by charging consumers. It shows that with premium partnerships, like its NFL Sunday Ticket offering, and ad-free consumption options, people are ready to pay for YouTube.\n\nYouTube isn’t moving away from advertising. The video site rang up $9.2 billion of ad revenue in Q4, up from $7.96 billion in the year ago period.\n\n“We’re obviously pleased with YouTube’s advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue,” YouTube’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler said on the call.\n\nYouTube’s paid subscription offerings differ in access and price point. The lowest price option is YouTube Music, which enables users to listen to music, and watch music videos without ads, reportedly paying out $0.002 per stream to artists. Next is YouTube Premium, previously called YouTube Red, that allows individuals to watch YouTube videos ad-free for $13.99 per month, and pays 55% of this to content owners who are being viewed by these subscribers. At the highest price point is NFL Sunday Ticket, a partnership between the NFL and YouTube, that enables subscribers to access games for $449 per season.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe subscriptions revenue is part of Google’s broader “Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices” category—a new line item that the company previously referred to as “Google Other.” In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices business generated $10.8 billion, up 23% year over year. The company didn’t break out the portion that subscriptions contributed to overall quarterly total, saying only that the subscription slice was now generating $15 billion on an annual basis.\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of YouTube and Google, reported better than expected Q4 results on Tuesday, with total revenue of $72.5 billion, above the $71 billion expected by analysts according to Bloomberg, with earnings per share of $1.64 versus Wall Street estimates of $1.59. Alphabet shares fell by more than 6% in after hours trading, as results in Google’s core search business came in shy of expectations, according to Bloomberg.\n\nGoogle’s subscriptions, platform and devices business, as well as its YouTube ads business, both outpaced the 12.7% growth rate of Google’s search during the quarter. Some investors may have braced for less positive news out of YouTube after it had laid off 100 employees, largely in its creator management division. This is part of Google’s two-year plan to reduce headcount--already having laid off 12,000-plus people in 2023.\n\nWhen asked about overall layoffs, Ruth Porat, the company’s chief financial officer, said that severance payouts account for $700 million of first quarter expenses, but will “pave the way” as they continue to “do the work [they’re] doing.”\n\nMuch of this work will be investing to encourage YouTube viewers to become subscribers. The company believes the strong growth in subscriptions is in-part a factor of YouTube’s increasing popularity on connected TVs, where users are streaming paid offerings like NFL Sunday Ticket and YouTube Premium. It plans to continue to “invest heavily” in these living room YouTube experiences, says Schindler.\n\nSchindler credited creators, who produce both free and premium video content, as the common thread powering YouTube’s business.\n\n“YouTube success starts with creator success,” said Schindler, describing how “more creators means more content, which leads to more viewers.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Microsoft touted how users were embracing its AI assistants, and Google said the technology was improving its search and cloud computing services.\n\nBut investors had bid up shares of the companies to record highs in recent weeks, betting that an AI bonanza would quickly fuel results.

Revenue from its Azure cloud-services unit jumped 30%.\n\nAI demand boosted that growth rate by 6 percentage points, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said.

Wall Street wanted more clarity on how much AI will contribute to financial performance going forward, said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. “Investors want them to quantify the AI potential over the next couple years,” he said.\n\nBut Microsoft isn’t going to follow the same pattern as Nvidia Corp., a maker of AI processors that has seen sales explode.\n\n“In terms of AI contribution for Microsoft, that’s not the way this is going to work,” Zino said. “This is going to be a slower slog than maybe some might have anticipated.”\n\n‘Much Faster’\n\nIn November, Microsoft released its 365 Copilot — an AI assistant for Office programs like Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Teams. The company didn’t give specifics on subscriptions for the product, but Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said on the conference call that adoption was “much faster” than with previous versions of the software.\n\nWith Google, softness in its core search advertising business raised concerns. But its quarterly report also sparked questions about whether it’s being aggressive enough in AI — and risks falling behind Microsoft.\n\nA slowdown in its ad business — the company’s main moneymaker — also could threaten AI ambitions, said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an analyst at Insider Intelligence.\n\n“Google advertising does make up the vast majority of its revenue,” she said. “As it prepares to really go full throttle on all of its carefully laid plans in AI, having that cash cow experience volatility doesn’t bode well.”\n\nAMD’s New Chip\n\nAMD’s stock had been one of the favorite picks of investors looking for ways to bet on AI computing.

        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - AI-related companies lost $190 billion in stock market value late on Tuesday after Microsoft, Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices delivered quarterly results that failed to impress investors who had sent their stocks soaring.\n\nThe selloff following the tech giants' reports after the bell underscored investors' elevated expectations following an AI-fueled stock market rally in recent months that propelled their shares to record highs with the promise of incorporating the technology across the corporate landscape.\n\nAlphabet dropped 5.6% after the Google-parent's December-quarter ad revenue missed expectations.\n\nAlphabet also said its spending on data centers to support its AI plans would jump this year, highlighting the costs of its fierce competition against AI rival Microsoft.\n\nWhile Google Cloud revenue growth slightly topped Wall Street targets, boosted by interest in AI, Microsoft's Azure grew faster.\n\nMicrosoft beat analyst estimates for quarterly revenue as new AI features helped attract customers to its cloud and Windows services. However, its stock fell 0.7% in extended trade after briefly hitting an intra-day record high earlier on Tuesday.\n\nOptimism about AI pushed Microsoft's stock market value above $3 trillion this month, eclipsing Apple.\n\nChipmaker Advanced Micro tumbled 6% after its forecast for first-quarter revenue missed estimates, even as it projected strong sales for its AI processors.\n\nShares of Nvidia, which have surged 27% in January after more than tripling last year on AI optimism, also gave back some of those gain in extended trade, last down over 2%.\n\nServer maker Super Micro Computer, another company that has benefited from AI-related demand, dropped over 3%. Earlier on Tuesday, it had climbed to a record high after delivering blowout quarterly results the day before.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Posts Strong Q4 and Fiscal Year 2023 Results Amid AI Investments\n\nOn January 30, 2024, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its 8-K filing, detailing the financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The company, which is the parent of internet media giant Google, reported a significant increase in revenue and net income, attributing much of its success to its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a diversified technology conglomerate with Google as its flagship subsidiary. Google's diverse revenue streams include online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, cloud service fees, and hardware sales. Alphabet also invests in ambitious \"moonshot\" projects through its Other Bets segment, aiming to revolutionize technology in health, internet access, autonomous driving, and more.\n\nFinancial Performance and Challenges\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported a robust financial performance for Q4, with consolidated revenues of $86 billion, marking a 13% increase year over year. The growth was consistent in constant currency terms as well. Operating income rose to $23.7 billion, up from $18.16 billion in the same quarter the previous year, and net income increased to $20.68 billion, up from $13.62 billion. These results underscore the importance of Alphabet's AI investments, particularly in Search, YouTube, and Cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these achievements, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) faced challenges, including a workforce reduction and office space optimization, which led to significant charges. The company recorded $2.1 billion in employee severance and related charges and $1.8 billion in exit charges for office space optimization for the fiscal year 2023. These actions, while aimed at improving operational efficiency, resulted in considerable expenses that impacted the financial statements.\n\nFinancial Achievements and Industry Significance\n\nThe company's financial achievements, particularly in the context of the Interactive Media industry, are significant. Alphabet's ability to consistently grow its revenue and maintain a high operating margin in a competitive and rapidly evolving sector demonstrates the effectiveness of its strategic focus on AI and innovation. The growth in Google Cloud revenues, which reached $9.19 billion in Q4, highlights the company's expanding presence in the cloud services market.\n\nKey Financial Metrics\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s financial strength is further illustrated by its balance sheet, with total assets increasing from $365.26 billion in 2022 to $402.39 billion in 2023. The company's liquidity position is solid, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $110.92 billion. The increase in net property and equipment to $134.345 billion reflects Alphabet's continued investment in its operational infrastructure.\n\nImportant metrics such as the operating margin, which improved to 27%, and diluted EPS, which increased to $1.64, are critical indicators of Alphabet's profitability and efficiency. These metrics are vital for investors as they assess the company's ability to generate earnings and manage expenses effectively.\n\nAnalysis of Performance\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s performance in Q4 and the fiscal year 2023 is a testament to the company's strategic vision and execution.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. fell in late trading after reporting earnings, sending Nasdaq 100 futures tumbling. Asian equity benchmarks are set for modest declines.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Risks Losing World’s Richest Title With Pay Deal Voided Musk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Tech Giants Slide in Late Trading After Earnings: Markets Wrap UPS CEO Kicks Off Productivity Drive by Cutting 12,000 Managers Traders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet\n\nAlphabet sank after reporting revenue from its core search advertising business that fell short of estimates, overshadowing an otherwise strong end to the year. Microsoft’s cloud growth disappointed some on Wall Street — even as the company posted its strongest revenue growth since 2022.\n\nFutures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.8% while those for the S&P 500 slipped 0.4%. Equities edged lower in Australia, while contracts pointed to declines for Japan and Hong Kong.\n\nUS benchmarks struggled for solid footing in Tuesday’s session as Wall Street digested a hotter-than-estimated reading on job openings, which left investors guessing what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will say at a rate policy meeting Wednesday. The market further trimmed bets on a March Fed cut.\n\n“Tomorrow may be significant for markets as the cross-currents of big-tech earnings, the ADP jobs report, the distribution of Treasury issuance, and Powell comments meet at a critical juncture,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. “I’m expecting Powell to take some rate cuts off the table by perhaps even calling the current projections aggressive.”\n\nThe S&P 500 was little changed, while the Nasdaq 100 underperformed, with Apple Inc. leading losses in megacaps. Traders also waded through results from an economic barometer — United Parcel Service Inc. — which tumbled on a disappointing outlook. The courier plans to cut 12,000 jobs. Financial shares gained after a bullish analyst call on major US banks. Treasury two-year yields rose four basis points to 4.36%. Ten-year yields fell two basis points to 4.05%.\n\nStory continues\n\nA survey conducted by 22V Research shows 38% of respondents expect Wednesday’s Fed meeting to be “risk-on,” 39% are betting on a mixed or negligible reaction and only 23% said “risk-off.” On aggregate, investors are paying more attention to payrolls (59%) than the Fed (41%) this week, according to the tally.\n\nSwap contracts referencing the March Fed meeting date — the next one after this week’s — now show about a third of a 25-basis-point drop. Late last year, a quarter-point cut in March was completely priced in, reflecting expectations for labor-market cooling that have failed to materialize.\n\nUS job openings unexpectedly rose in December to the highest level in three months while fewer Americans quit their jobs. Tuesday’s data kicks off a slew of releases that will offer insights into the state of the labor market. A report due Wednesday is forecast to point to easing employment costs at the end of 2023, while the government’s jobs report Friday is projected to show US employers added around 185,000 positions in January.\n\n“The job market holds the keys to future Fed policy,” said Jeffrey Roach at LPL Financial. “In addition to the solid job market, uncertainty over the impact from Red Sea shipping disruption adds pressure to the Fed as they prepare markets for rate cuts.”\n\nSeparate data showed US consumer confidence increased in January to the highest level since the end of 2021 as Americans grew more upbeat about the economy and the job market amid more sanguine views about inflation.\n\n“For the Federal Reserve — as most data releases are now interpreted through the lens of the Fed — concern is centered on whether a more confident consumer could ignite another bout of inflation,” said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial. “Still, consumer confidence is key to whether the economic landscape remains robust, helping to ensure a soft landing.”\n\nFive megacaps with a combined market value of over $10 trillion report results this week. Those firms, along with the other members of Magnificent Seven, carry an about 34% premium to the S&P 500 in terms of forward price-to-earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“If we don’t get any shockingly negative news from the large-cap tech earnings this week and (especially) if the Fed sticks with its current (much more) dovish rhetoric, it’s going to give investors the kind of green light that could push the stock market higher into February —just like the market rallied strongly into February in 2020,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co.\n\nIn other markets, the dollar was little changed and short-dated Treasury yields rose after the jobs-opening data. Oil rose in choppy trading after earlier dropping on Saudi Aramco’s abandonment of a plan to boost output capacity.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nChina non-manufacturing PMI, manufacturing PMI, Wednesday Japan industrial production, retail sales, housing starts, Wednesday Bank of Japan issues summary of opinions from January policy meeting, Wednesday Boeing announces earnings amid US government safety probe, Wednesday Federal Reserve interest rate decision and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference, Wednesday.

The S&P 500 was little changed Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.8%.

        "title": "Big Earnings Afternoon: Microsoft, Alphabet, Starbucks &amp; More",
        "content": "Market performance today was less than stellar, but nothing worth worrying too much about: the S&P 500 was flat all day following yesterday’s close notching its sixth all-time high so far this year, -0.06%. The Dow actually gained +133 points, +0.35%, but it was alone in the green today: the Nasdaq sold off -118 points, -0.76%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 was down a similar -0.71%.\r\n\r\nDecember Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed some mixed results earlier today: while job openings rose back over 9 million for the first time since September of last year, 9.03 million (the previous month was revised up from 8.8 million to 8.925 million), we’re still well off the 10 million-plus we’d been seeing as recently as April of 2023. Job Quits, on the other hand, fell to their lowest levels since early 2021: 3.39 million. We’d seen a 4+ million print last May. Thus, longer-term progress is apparent, though employers are still looking to fill seats.\r\n\r\nQ4 earnings season hits its busiest day so far, and it starts this afternoon with Microsoft MSFT, which posted its sixth-straight earnings beat: $2.93 per share outpaced the $2.76 expected (and $2.32 per share in the year-ago quarter). Revenues likewise topped expectations, with $62 billion brought in for fiscal Q2 from $61 billion anticipated. Azure growth outperformed as well, reaching +30% in the quarter from a projected +27.5%. Revenue growth at Office 365 was strong at +17%, possibly on growth from its A.I. chatbot Copilot. Microsoft’s recent Activision acquisition helped Xbox gain +60% in the quarter.\r\n\r\nAlphabet GOOGL beat the consensus earnings forecast by 4 cents per share to $1.64 per share (up more than +50% year over year) for its fourth-straight quarterly earnings beat. Revenues also outperformed expectations to $72.3 billion (accounting for traffic acquisition costs [TAC], which is not reported on Alphabet’s headline; $86.3 billion in revenues were without subtracting $13.986 billion in TAC costs. Its Cloud business surpassed estimates — $9.19 billion versus $8.94 billion expected — though YouTube was a hair below forecast to $9.20 billion in the quarter.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD met earnings consensus at 77 cents, extending its string of quarterly non-misses on earnings since Q4 2018. Revenues of $6.17 billion came in ahead of the $6.11 billion analysts were looking for, though revenue guidance was down for the coming quarter: $5.4 billion versus $5.7 billion expected. Data Center brought in $2.3 billion in the quarter, but is expected to be flat with a pending seasonal decline in server sales (similar to Intel). Shares are down -3% on the news, though at +80% over the past three months, the stock had been priced for perfection.\r\n\r\nStarbucks SBUX missed expectations on both top and bottom lines: earnings of 90 cents per share on quarterly sales of $9.4 billion were a tad light of the 92 cents per share and $9.58 billion anticipated. All three main regional segments were lower than expected: Global was +5% versus +7.2% estimated, North America +5% versus +5.8% forecast, and International +7% from +13.2% projected. However, shares are up +3% on the news, now trading flat year to date.\r\n\r\nInternational snack giant Mondelez MDLZ outperformed estimates on both earnings and sales in its Q4 report after today’s close, reporting 84 cents per share, which bettered the 78 cents expected (and 73 cents per share a year ago) on revenues of $9.31 billion, which narrowly outpaced the $9.30 billion analysts were looking for. Both North America and Asia came in slightly below expectations, and shares are trading down -3.7% in the after-market.\r\n\r\nSkyworks Solutions SWKS also reported earnings results for its fiscal Q1, beating by two cents on the bottom line to $1.97 per share (though well off the $2.59 reported in the year-ago quarter), while revenues of $1.20 billion met consensus estimates. Nest quarter earnings guidance is also slightly down from earlier projections, though a recovering smartphone market and record free cash flow have helped the stock move up +2.7% in late trading.\r\n\r\nTomorrow morning brings us private-sector payroll results for January from Automatic Data Processing ADP, along with that company’s fiscal Q2 earnings report. We’ll also see earnings results from Boeing BA, Mastercard MA and Novo Nordisk NVO, among many others. We’ll also get the latest Fed decision on interest rates as this year’s first FOMC meeting adjourns tomorrow at 2 pm, though it is unanimously expected that no moves from the current 5.25-5.50% Fed funds rate will be made.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings: How Key Metrics Compare to Wall Street Estimates",
        "content": "For the quarter ended December 2023, Alphabet (GOOGL) reported revenue of $72.32 billion, up 14.6% over the same period last year. EPS came in at $1.64, compared to $1.05 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +2.19% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $1.60, the EPS surprise was +2.50%.\n\nWhile investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Alphabet performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nTotal TAC (traffic acquisition costs): $13.99 billion versus the 13-analyst average estimate of $13.95 billion. Headcount (Number of employees): 182,502 versus the three-analyst average estimate of 182,484. Revenues- EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa): $25.01 billion versus $24.76 billion estimated by three analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +14.9% change. Revenues- United States: $42 billion compared to the $40.09 billion average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of +13.6% year over year. Revenues- Other Americas (Canada and Latin America): $5.18 billion compared to the $5.16 billion average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of +11.2% year over year. Revenues- APAC (Asia-Pacific): $13.98 billion versus the three-analyst average estimate of $13.82 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +16.7%. Revenues- Google properties: $57.22 billion versus $57.02 billion estimated by 13 analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +13.2% change. Revenues- Google Cloud: $9.19 billion versus the 12-analyst average estimate of $9.04 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +25.7%. Revenues- YouTube ads: $9.20 billion versus $9.10 billion estimated by 12 analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +15.5% change. Revenues- Google Search & other: $48.02 billion versus the 12-analyst average estimate of $47.84 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +12.7%. Revenues- Google Network: $8.30 billion versus $8.52 billion estimated by 12 analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a -2.1% change. Revenues- Google advertising: $65.52 billion versus $65.45 billion estimated by 12 analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +11% change.\n\nStory continues\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for Alphabet here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have returned +9.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change.

With search being one of the powerhouses of revenue for the Google-parent, questions around the impact of AI on search and ad revenue arise.\n\nBaird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the impacts of AI on search engines and what it could mean for Google and other tech companies.\n\nWhen asked about how AI can potentially interrupt Google's dominance, Mortonson replies: \"It will over the next two to three years, but it's nothing instantaneous. When you see the Meta (META) results and the Google results, they're still two of the most dominant players in advertising and they will be for the next quarters to come.

        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.64 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.05 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this internet search leader would post earnings of $1.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.55, delivering a surprise of 6.90%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nAlphabet , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $72.32 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.19%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $63.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAlphabet shares have added about 9.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Alphabet?\n\nWhile Alphabet has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alphabet: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.46 on $65.37 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.69 on $284.27 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Services is currently in the top 44% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Upwork (UPWK), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 14.\n\nThis online freelance marketplace operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +325%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nUpwork's revenues are expected to be $178.43 million, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet Shares Fall After Search Revenue Misses Estimates",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. reported fourth-quarter revenue from its core search advertising business that fell short of analysts’ estimates, overshadowing an otherwise strong end to the year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Tech Giants Drop in Late Trading After Earnings: Markets Wrap UPS CEO Kicks Off Productivity Drive by Cutting 12,000 Managers Traders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers\n\nSales, excluding partner payouts, were $72.3 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, the company said Tuesday in a statement. That was better than the $71 billion analysts had projected, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income was $1.64 per share, compared with Wall Street’s estimate of $1.59 per share.\n\nBut revenue in Alphabet’s core search business was $48 billion, narrowly missing analysts’ projections for $48.15 billion. The shares fell 4.3% in extended trading.\n\nThe disappointing results come at a time of broader uncertainty for Google’s search engine, which has dominated the global internet for years and is the subject of a major antitrust case. Its leading position is threatened by new competition as the rise of generative AI has enabled companies like Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI to deliver programs that answer users’ questions in a more conversational fashion, like the wildly popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\n“Google advertising does make up the vast majority of its revenue and as it prepares to really go full throttle on all of its carefully laid plans in AI, having that cash cow experience volatility doesn’t bode well,” said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an analyst at Insider Intelligence.\n\nWall Street had high expectations for Alphabet’s efforts in AI, pushing the stock up almost 60% over the past 12 months, valuing the company at nearly $2 trillion. But now investors are looking for a sense of when the technology will actually start moving the needle for earnings and revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle has raced to weave the new technology into its own products, and last month released its most powerful large language model, called Gemini. But Alphabet has been dogged by concerns that it’s been to slow to capitalize on the shift in the market and has been playing catch up to Microsoft in the AI race.\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai plows resources into AI and other big priorities, executives have scrutinized operations to identify places where they can make cuts. Earlier this year, the company eliminated hundreds of employees in areas including hardware, engineering, and the moonshot technology lab X. More rounds of layoffs may follow this year, Pichai has said. Google had 182,502 employees as of Dec. 31, a 4% decline from a year earlier.\n\nPresident Ruth Porat said Google is continuing to invest in “top engineering and technical talent,” and “where possible, in support of our growth opportunities we are reallocating talent across Alphabet.”\n\nIn the last three months of the year, Google’s closely watched cloud unit brought in an operating profit of $864 million, beating analysts’ estimates for $427 million. Google still trails Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in the market for cloud computing, but this quarter’s results mark Google Cloud’s first full year of profitability, pointing to a relatively healthy business unit.\n\n“We are really pleased with the cloud growth,” Porat said on a call with reporters. “Strength was pretty broad-based and there is nothing really to call out on the geographic contribution.”\n\nThe company has been vying for years to diversify beyond the product that made it a household name. YouTube, one of its prized businesses, reported $9.2 billion in revenue, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $9.16 billion. The unit has been the most susceptible to marketers’ pullback in spending as the digital ad market floundered in the past year.\n\nAlphabet’s Other Bets — the company’s moonshot unit that includes the self-driving car effort Waymo and the life sciences unit Verily — brought in $657 million in revenue while losing $863 million in operating income. That was still less than analysts’ projection for a loss of $1.3 billion.\n\nThe Google Network business, in which the company serves up ads on other parts of the internet, saw its revenue decline by 2% to $8.3 billion. That business, which has been an ongoing weak spot in Alphabet’s results, will be at the center of an antitrust trial later this year.\n\n(Updates with detail from various business units.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, missing analysts' expectations on ad revenue, the heart of the tech giant's business.\n\nThe stock slid 4% lower in extended trading.\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs for the third quarter, was $72 billion versus expectations of nearly $71 billion. That's higher than the $63.12 billion the company generated during the same period in the prior year. But investors seemed to focus on the advertising miss.\n\nThe company reported continued growth in its cloud business, which has grown in importance to investors because of its usefulness in the development of AI. Google Cloud revenue beat expectations, crossing $9 billion, amounting to more than 20% growth from a year ago.\n\nHere are some of Alphabet’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs: $72.32 billion vs. $70.97 billion expected ($63.12 billion in Q4 2022) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.64 vs. $1.59 expected ($1.05 in Q4 2022) Cloud revenue: $9.19 billion vs. $8.95 billion expected ($7.32 billion in Q4 2022) Ad revenue: $65.5 billion vs. $65.8 billion expected ($59.04 billion in Q4 2022)\n\n\"We are pleased with the ongoing strength in Search and the growing contribution from YouTube and Cloud,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai in the company's earnings release. “Each of these is already benefiting from our AI investments and innovation.\"\n\nThe earnings report arrives just weeks after Google laid off hundreds of workers across multiple divisions as the company aims to cut expenses and focus on growth areas, including AI. The tech giant joins several of its peers and others across corporate America that have relied on layoffs to boost efficiency in the wake of significant expansions in the COVID era.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Google was widely seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nThe company has been pushing to claim additional market share in the cloud computing market, where it currently sits in third place behind West Coast competitors Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s corporate parent returned to double-digit revenue growth during last year’s final quarter, signaling the internet powerhouse has regained its footing even as it grapples with regulatory and competitive threats to its digital empire.\n\nThe results announced Tuesday by Alphabet Inc. marked the third consecutive quarter of escalating revenue growth for the Mountain View, California, company, with most of the sales coming through Google’s dominance of search and online advertising. The rebound followed an unprecedented drop in Google’s ad revenue coming out of the pandemic following nearly 20 years of uninterrupted growth.\n\nBut the money flowing from Google’s search engine and ad network are under attack in the courts, where regulators have been leveling allegations of abusive tactics that they contend is stifling innovation and competition. One case, brought by the U.S. Justice Department, went to trial last autumn, and will move to closing arguments in May.\n\nMeanwhile, long-time rival Microsoft has been making inroads in artificial intelligence that have helped re-establish the nearly 50-year-old software maker as the world’s most valuable company, while Google has been scrambling to roll out its own versions of a technology that is expected to transform the world.\n\nFor now, though, Google’s moneymaking machine appears to be hitting on all cylinders. Alphabet’s revenue for the October-December period climbed 13% from the previous year to $86.31 billion. It marked Alphabet’s first quarter of double-digit revenue growth since the April-June 2022 period, at the tail end of the pandemic.\n\nAlphabet earned $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share, in its most recent quarter, a 52% increase from the same time in the previous year. The robust gain came despite a $1.2 billion charge taken to account for more than 1,000 layoffs that the company has made since the start of this year, and its plans to pare its office space as more employees spend part or all of their time working remotely.\n\n“We remain committed to our work to durably re-engineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth opportunities,” said Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief investment officer.\n\nBoth the fourth-quarter revenue topped the analyst projections that steer investors. Despite that, Alphabet's stock price still fell more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out.",

        "title": "Microsoft beats Q2 earnings on AI, cloud strength, shares flat",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) announced its second quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion, beating expectations of adjusted EPS of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion.\n\nShares of the company were off 1% following the announcement.\n\nMicrosoft's all-important cloud revenue topped out at $33.7 billion, beating estimates if $32.2 billion. The company's Intelligent Cloud business, which includes its Azure service, came in at $25.8 billion versus expectations of $25.3 billion. According to the company, AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, increasing from 3 percentage points last quarter.\n\n\"We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.”\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft’s market capitalization over $3 trillion.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.\n\nOn the productivity side of things, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes revenue should hit $19.25 billion, just ahead of estimates of $19.03 billion. The company’s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, generated $16.89 billion. Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella during a press event at CES 2024. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) (Ethan Miller via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft’s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot’s more advanced features.\n\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year, as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\n\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and, in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\n\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently, as users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, it’s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it’s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

It had posted $59.0 billion a year earlier.\n\nAlphabet has faced tough competition for ad budgets from other online platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Amazon.com, alongside mixed economic signals in the U.S.\n\n\"Alphabet's disappointing ad revenue numbers suggest that corporations worldwide are still uncertain about the pace of interest rate cuts from global central banks,\" commented Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com.\n\nGoogle, inventor of foundational technology for today's AI boom, also faces tough competition from the two players that have captured the business world's attention, ChatGPT's creator OpenAI and its financial backer Microsoft.\n\nWhile Google's cloud revenue growth slightly topped Wall Street targets, boosted by interest in AI, Microsoft's Azure grew faster.\n\nGoogle is bringing a powerful suite of models called Gemini to its ChatGPT rival Bard. It struck a deal to invest up to $2 billion in high-profile AI startup Anthropic as it courts customers from larger cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon, and it is putting Gemini into advertisers' hands so their dollars keep flowing to Google's search business.\n\nStill, AI's advertising boost may remain far off, in a period of concern that geopolitical and economic uncertainty could discourage ad buyers. The U.S. has started probing AI investments including Alphabet's, Google is gearing up to appeal a major antitrust case it lost, and the company like others in technology has been cutting jobs.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 stood at $86.3 billion, compared with estimates of $85.3 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nInvestors have grown more interested in the fortunes of Google Cloud. Last year the division earned its first-ever quarterly profit, but revenue growth slowed as customers streamlined cloud spending.\n\nMicrosoft has been a fierce competitor, adding AI to its cloud and productivity suite long embraced by enterprises, while Google has marketed rival tools. OpenAI's Nov. 2022 launch of ChatGPT ignited a frenzy over generative AI, which can conjure new text and images on command.\n\nAlphabet said Google Cloud revenue in the latest quarter was $9.2 billion, while analysts were expecting $8.9 billion. That marked a re-acceleration of cloud revenue growth from the previous quarter to 25.7% but was slower than 32% growth in the year-ago quarter. Microsoft on Tuesday reported that sales of its cloud product, Azure, grew at 30%.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts that cloud growth was driven in part by generative artificial intelligence.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin and Peter Henderson in San Francisco; Editing by Arun Koyyur and David Gregorio)",

        "title": "Op-ed: Biden admin says rules must ensure AI boom 'does right by workers'",
        "content": "This is an op-ed from Lael Brainard, White House National Economic Advisor, and Julie Su, Acting Secretary of Labor.\n\nAmerican workers are making themselves heard. But just as workers are starting to lay the foundations for a stable future, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is creating new uncertainty.\n\nAmerican workers are seeing strong wage gains beyond inflation, the longest stretch of an unemployment rate below 4% in fifty years, and historic collective bargaining agreements across the economy. Yet, opinion polls show nearly four in ten Americans saying they don’t know how AI will change their jobs. One in four express FOBO—fear of becoming obsolete.\n\nAI holds tremendous promise and potential peril. On the one hand, AI can improve medical diagnoses, make work less burdensome, and increase productivity for workers and companies. On the other, it threatens to exacerbate bias, erode job quality, and displace workers. For example, the use of AI to inform hiring, promotion, or disciplinary decisions, without meaningful oversight, can replicate bias embedded in the data on which it is trained. Similarly, algorithmic management tools that monitor worker performance or allocate work tasks may create risks of injury. And the massive amounts of data these technological tools use can violate workers’ privacy or jeopardize their ability to organize unions.\n\nPresident Biden has stated his commitment to the safe and responsible development of AI and to both fostering innovation and protecting workers. Simply put, AI is neither safe nor responsible unless it does right by workers. The role of AI in our lives will be the determined by choices that we make as a society and industry, labor, workers, and government all have a role to play. FILE - President Joe Biden speaks at South Carolina's First in the Nation dinner at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Columbia, S.C., Jan. 27, 2024. The Biden administration will start implementing a new requirement that the developers of major artificial intelligence systems disclose their safety test results to the government. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAs the most pro-union, pro-worker President in history, President Biden has made clear that workers must have a seat at the table as AI is designed and deployed. And, as we just marked the 90-day anniversary of the President’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, this becomes more imperative.\n\nStory continues\n\nLabor and industry are already finding win-win solutions that nurture creativity and innovation while safeguarding workers’ livelihoods. In September, the 20,000 screenwriters of the Writers Guild of America struck a historic collective bargaining agreement, their first ever to address AI. The agreement ensures that writers alone receive writing credits and prevents studios from using AI for scriptwriting—while giving writers the choice to use AI as a tool to support their creative work. Similarly, rail workers have negotiated to ensure that workers oversee any AI-enabled technologies used to scan railway cars. culinary workers in Las Vegas secured commitments of advance notice before new technologies, including robotics, are deployed in the workplace.\n\nModern collective bargaining agreements like these underscore the vital role of unions in building and fortifying the middle class, now and in the future. They also provide positive, replicable models for the broader labor market; whether a union exists or not, industry and labor can establish formal mechanisms to incorporate workers’ perspectives into AI development and deployment, equip workers with the digital literacy necessary to adapt to an AI-enabled work, and advocate collectively for worker-centric policies. This is exactly what Microsoft recently done in a newly announced partnership with the AFL-CIO. Importantly, Microsoft has also pledged to maintain neutrality in any future organizing efforts.\n\nThe Biden Administration is committed to doing its part. This includes embedding worker protections in rules for key grant programs, and continuing to promote high-quality jobs and the right to organize through the Department of Labor’s Good Jobs Initiative.\n\nThe Department of Labor is also creating a set of principles for the responsible, worker-centric use of AI. These principles will prescribe vital safeguards, such as transparency in the use of AI, careful pre-deployment testing of AI systems, appropriate and meaningful human review of their outputs, and privacy-enhancing technologies. Additionally, the National Science Foundation is investing in critical research around privacy-preserving techniques, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has already released guidance to ensure the use of AI aligns with civil rights laws.\n\nWe are going further to ensure workers thrive in an AI-powered economy, and can take advantage of benefits that this technology might bring, by supporting inclusive training programs that help all workers access jobs created or changed by AI. The Administration is also preparing detailed policy recommendations to protect and support workers against potential AI-related job displacement. After decades of rising income inequality and communities of workers being left behind in previous periods of technological advancements, we need to ensure that any economic windfalls from AI do not come at the expense of displaced workers. Instead, reinvesting gains from AI in workers will help us secure stronger economic growth for decades to come.\n\nAI has already proven to be a powerful new technology, but its productive use for the benefit of all of society depends upon us. Employers, industry and government should only be advancing AI that works for workers because that’s the only way AI works for America.\n\nClick here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures experienced a downturn on Tuesday night following the release of quarterly results by two leading tech corporations Microsoft and Alphabet. Investors are also focusing on the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates.\n\nBy 6:40 pm ET (11:40 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures were little changed, S&P 500 Futures fell 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 Futures lost 0.9%.\n\nIn post-market trading, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell by 0.7% despite reporting EPS of $2.93 versus $2.78 expected, while revenues surpassed estimates, coming in at $62 billion versus $61.1 billion expected. However, less-than-anticipated growth in cloud services was also reported.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) declined by 5.6% after reporting EPS of $1.64 versus $1.59 expected, while revenues came in at $86.31 billion versus $85.23 billion expected. Ad revenue, however, appeared to fall short of investor expectations. As a result, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) also experienced a decrease in stock value.\n\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) fell by 5.9% after reporting EPS of $0.77, in-line with expectations, while revenues were reported at $6.2 billion versus $6.13 billion expected.\n\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) gained 4.2% after the company reported EPS of $0.9 versus $0.94 expected, while revenues came in at $9.43 billion versus $9.62 billion expected. The coffee giant also reported a 5% increase in global comparable store sales.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) also fell by 3.5% after-hours, following a legal decision to nullify Elon Musk’s $55 billion pay package.\n\nTake advantage of InvestingPro this earnings season - Receive an additional 10% off on the Pro+ 2-year subscription using the promo code \"INVPRODEAL\".\n\nThe tech sector, which has been the driving force behind the market rally from 2023 into 2024, currently trades at a relatively high valuation of nearly 29 times its 2024 earnings. In light of this, investors will need to see an expansion in earnings for tech companies to sustain their high price-to-book levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis activity follows a mixed day for stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, adding 0.4%. The S&P 500 marginally declined by 0.1% while the NASDAQ Composite lost 0.8%.\n\nThe focus for traders on Wednesday will be the Fed's rate decision. The fed funds futures market has priced in a nearly 98% probability that the central bank will leave rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Investors will be seeking indications of shifts in the central bank's policy stance in its post-meeting statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks.\n\nIn terms of earnings, Dow member Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) is set to release its results on Wednesday before the bell, while chipmaker Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is scheduled to announce its quarterly earnings after the close.\n\nOn the bond markets, United States 10-Year rates were at 4.036%.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDow futures steady as tech giants report, Fed decision on tap\n\nStryker forecasts strong 2024 as uptick in surgeries lift demand for devices\n\nSamsung sees tech devices demand recovering in 2024 after record chip loss",

        "content": "Earnings season steps it up a notch this week as over 400 companies are expected to report earnings. Many of them are large cap growth stocks, including several Magnificent 7 stocks like Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms.\n\nBut the Mag 7 aren’t the only stocks hitting new highs. Even among these five stocks featured here, two are hitting new highs which aren’t in the Mag 7. One is a mid-cap which is little known unless you’re in the Zacks Value Investor portfolio which owns it.\n\nGreat Earnings Surprise Records\n\nLet’s not forget that many of these growth stocks also have outstanding earnings surprise track records. Two of the companies have only missed once in the last 5 years. That’s impressive given that there was a pandemic during that time.\n\nIt’s difficult for any company to beat every quarter, or nearly every quarter, over the course of 5 years. Pandemic or not.\n\nCan they beat again?\n\n5 Growth Stocks to Watch This Week\n\n1. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft has only missed one time in the last 5 years and it was in 2022. The analysts are on the sidelines. There’s been no changes to the earnings estimates going into the earnings report.\n\nShares of Microsoft are up 65% over the last year and it’s hitting new all-time highs. But Microsoft isn’t cheap. It trades with a P/S ratio of 13.8. The last time it was over 10, was at the end of the dot-com boom.\n\nAre valuations stretched on Microsoft?\n\n2. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet has a so-so earnings record. While it’s beat 3 quarters in a row, it had missed 4 quarters in a row prior to that.\n\nShares of Alphabet are up 53.1% in the last year and are hitting new all-time highs. Alphabet is cheaper than Microsoft, with a P/S ratio of just 6.4.\n\nDoes Alphabet have attractive valuations?\n\n3. Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)\n\nStarbucks has beat 3 quarters in a row but it hasn’t helped the shares, which are actually down 14.9% over the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Starbucks cheap? It trades with a P/S ratio of just 2.9 and a forward P/E of 22.6. For a growth stock, that’s attractively valued.\n\nIs this a buying opportunity in Starbucks?\n\n4. Mastercard Inc. (MA)\n\nMastercard has a great earnings surprise track record. It has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was back in 2020.\n\nShares of Mastercard are up 17.2% over the last year and are busting out to new highs. Mastercard trades with a P/S ratio of 16.8, which is high. It also has a forward P/E of 31.\n\nShould you be concerned about valuations with Mastercard?\n\n5. Modine Manufacturing Co. (MOD)\n\nModine Manufacturing is the unknown company among these 5, with a market cap of just $3.4 billion, but it’s chart is just as red hot. Modine has a great earnings surprise track record, beating 8 quarters in a row.\n\nShares of Modine Manufacturing are up 178.6% over the last year. It trades with a P/S ratio of just 1.36. That would put it in the value category.\n\nIs Modine Manufacturing a steal even at all-time highs?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT, GOOGL and SBUX in her own personal portfolio and MOD in the Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet earnings preview: Investors eye AI, cloud, and job cuts updates",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is set to release quarterly earnings after the bell on Tuesday, kicking off a big week for US tech giants that will offer updates on the race for AI dominance, the state of the ad market, and an intensifying regulatory crackdown that coincides with a presidential election.\n\nInvestors will be looking for details on the earnings call about the company’s cloud business in addition to insight into Google’s recent layoffs and its artificial intelligence initiatives.\n\nHere’s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Alphabet’s most significant metrics in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter:\n\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs: $70.97 billion expected ($63.12 billion in Q4 2022) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.59 expected ($1.05 in Q4 2022) Cloud revenue: $8.95 billion expected ($7.32 billion in Q4 2022) Ad revenue: $65.8 billion expected ($59.04 billion in Q4 2022)\n\nThe report arrives just weeks after Google laid off hundreds of workers across multiple divisions as the company aims to cut expenses and focus on growth areas, including AI. The tech giant joins several of its peers and others across corporate America that have relied on layoffs to boost efficiency in the wake of significant expansions in the COVID era.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a widely covered internal memo earlier this month that more layoffs were likely needed across the entire company in 2024.\n\nChief among concerns raised by analysts is the rate of Google’s ad growth compared to its main rival, Meta (META), which reports on Thursday. Ad revenues are expected to jump by double digits, in an optimistic break from recent quarters that’s tied to the company integrating new AI tools into its legacy search infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet has described the shift to AI as a profound transition for society. But the technology also presents a broader threat to Google’s flagship search products, since generative AI chatbots change the way people interact with the web, replacing the formulaic search engine with a more natural conversation style for users to access information. For Google, in particular, the disruptions brought on by AI usage are a major area of concern for some analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle has embarked on a host of efforts to both augment its search tools with AI (Bard and Search Generative Experience) and to offer new, advanced large language models, like Gemini. Analysts will be looking to probe the company’s progress on AI integration and to get a better read on the costs of developing sophisticated AI technologies.\n\nLast year, Google was widely seen as playing catch up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle’s cloud business is expected to rebound after missing estimates last quarter. The company has been pushing to claim additional market share in the cloud computing market, where it currently sits in third place, behind West Coast competitors Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft.\n\nAlphabet’s earnings arrive at a moment when the standing of Big Tech’s financial performance has never been more evident on Wall Street. The muscular earnings growth among the tech giants is expected to continue to drive the market rally, as the biggest names from California and Washington state lift up the S&P 500. Alphabet is among an elite handful of tech names that are expected to grow earnings by almost 80% in the first quarter of 2024, according to data from FactSet. The other 496 companies are collectively expected to grow earnings by 0.3%.\n\nBut tech's staggering gains have also drawn heightened scrutiny from regulatory watchdogs.

        "title": "Microsoft, Alphabet Under Pressure to Show AI Earnings Boost",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For about a year, investors have bid up megacap tech shares on the theory that their exposure to artificial intelligence will usher in a new era of elevated growth and efficiency. Now the companies need to prove it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Traders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts UPS to Cut 12,000 Jobs, Bring Workers in Five Days a Week\n\nMicrosoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., two of the biggest players in AI-related software, will report after the market close, and Wall Street wants a stronger sense of when the rally-driving technology will start moving the needle for earnings and revenue. Both stocks have been supported by AI excitement; Microsoft is above a historic $3 trillion valuation, while Google’s parent company returned to all-time highs.\n\n“AI might facilitate growth over the foreseeable future, but I’m not sure most big tech stocks have much to show for it yet,” said Dan Taylor, who oversees about $40 billion as chief investment officer of Man Numeric. “Any clarity they give about the likely impact over 2024 or 2025 will be crucial. Expectations are very high, and if the outlooks don’t support that, then we could see some issues with the stocks.”\n\nMicrosoft gained 0.4% on Tuesday while Alphabet dipped 0.3%. The Nasdaq 100 Index dropped 0.2%.\n\nThe stakes are especially high for Microsoft, which trades at an elevated multiple and has rolled out AI-supported assistant services related to its OpenAI investment. Last quarter, its results highlighted the increasing impact AI had on growth in its Azure cloud business and investors will be looking for a repeat performance — or better.\n\nBoth stocks are among the so-called Magnificent Seven that have led the market’s advance. They are up more than 70% since the end of 2022, including gains of nearly 10% in January. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up less than 5% this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpectations are high for AI-related growth. UBS Group AG forecast $420 billion in AI revenue by 2027, up from $28 billion in 2022, and it said AI “could arguably be the tech theme of the decade, as we don’t see similar growth profiles elsewhere.”\n\nBoth Microsoft and Alphabet are seen at the cutting edge. In addition to Microsoft’s Copilot assistant products and AI lifting demand for cloud computing, Alphabet recently released its Gemini AI model, easing concerns that it has fallen behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Alphabet’s results were seen as a disappointment last quarter, especially with its cloud business.\n\nThe upcoming reports are expected to reflect healthy growth for both companies. Revenue at Microsoft is seen rising about 16%, while Alphabet’s comes in at about 12%. However, consensus expectations for the quarter have barely changed for either over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, suggesting that the excitement over AI isn’t translating to improved near-term expectations.\n\nFor Microsoft, “this is a year of laying the foundation for GenAI adoption, as we are still taxiing toward the runway, with actual M365 takeoff likely closer to 2025,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts wrote, referencing the company’s family of productivity software. Citigroup calculates $7 billion in Office Consumer Copilot monetization by Microsoft’s 2026 fiscal year; the company made about $212 billion in total revenue last year.\n\nShould Microsoft indicate that an inflection from AI is further out than Wall Street is anticipating, that could put pressure on the stock. Shares trade above 33 times estimated earnings, their highest in about two years, and well above the 10-year average below 24. The Nasdaq 100 Index has a multiple of 26. Alphabet’s multiple is lower, at 21 times, but this represents a slight premium to its long-term average.\n\n“AI is something we’re trying to get a handle on, since even if it is transformative, translating that to products and profits is challenging, and we’re trying to figure out the drivers of growth going forward,” said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.\n\n“I think these are solid companies that have proven their ability to generate very strong profitability over a very long period of time, but given the run we’ve had, it wouldn’t surprise me to see markets selling on the earnings, even if the news is good.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTech stocks have rallied nearly 25% from their October low, resulting in the Nasdaq 100 adding more than $4 trillion in market value. The rally has been partly fueled by the rising earnings estimates for the tech-heavy benchmark. Analysts on average have continued to raise earnings estimates for tech firms as the largest mega-caps gear up to report results this week.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nElon Musk said that the first human patient has received a brain implant from his startup Neuralink Corp., a significant step forward for the company that aims to one day let humans control computers with their minds. International Business Machines Corp. delivered a companywide ultimatum to managers who are still working remotely: move near an office or leave the company. The once-hot logistics startup Flexport Inc. plans to lay off hundreds of workers, according to a person familiar with the matter — the company’s latest effort to reposition itself during a global shipping industry slowdown. TikTok is testing a feature that could make all posts shoppable, the social media company’s latest move to create a multi-billion-dollar US e-commerce business. Chip equipment maker J.E.T. Co.’s shares have more than doubled since their September debut in Tokyo, bolstered by expectations that US and Japan initiatives to boost semiconductor prowess will propel sales. Deal makers are turning to artificial intelligence and generative AI tools to source data, screen targets and conduct due diligence at a time of heightened regulatory concerns around mergers and acquisitions, Bain & Co. said in its annual report on the industry released Tuesday.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nCorning CommVault Postmarket\n\nMicrosoft Alphabet AMD Electronic Arts Match Group Skyworks Teradyne Manhattan Associates Juniper Littelfuse\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Michael Msika.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 35 most congested cities in the world. If you want to skip our discussion on the traffic management system market, you can go directly to the  5 Most Congested Cities in the World.\n\nIn 2023, congestion remained a key problem in many big cities around the world. Congestion affects various aspects of society, influencing economic progress, increasing the number of traffic incidents, and contributing to higher greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions, in turn, have adverse effects on public health. With the ongoing population growth and the rise in the number of vehicles, the importance of traffic management systems becomes apparent. The global traffic management system market is estimated to be valued at $26.72 billion as of 2023. The market is predicted to reach $74.09 billion by 2033, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% during the forecast period. By 2033, the United States is expected to hold a significant market share of 25%. The United States is actively implementing measures to reduce traffic congestion by improving its transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, telematics service providers are developing innovative solutions such as integrated hands-free cell phones for vehicles to increase safety.\n\nSeveral companies, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), are working on initiatives to reduce traffic congestion and improve road conditions. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offers services such as Google Maps, which leverages real-time user data to provide updated traffic information and route suggestions. Furthermore, Waze, a company acquired by Google, enables drivers to report traffic issues and accidents, aiding others in avoiding these situations. Similarly, Conduent Inc (NASDAQ:CNDT) specializes in providing advanced analytics and traffic enforcement solutions. These technologies aim to improve operational efficiency and enhance street safety. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is another popular player in this space, offering a cab-hailing service with a carpooling feature known as Uber Pool (recently renamed UberX Share). This feature encourages ridesharing at discounted prices, which contributes to the reduction of individual automobiles on the roads.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere’s what Polen Capital said about Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies provides ride hailing services to customers worldwide. The Company develops applications for road transportation, navigation, ride sharing, and payment processing solutions. Polen Capital originally purchased the 4.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029 in our client accounts on the back of the Company’s new focus on profitability and free-cash-flow generation. Our view was that the Company’s credit metrics would improve over the next two-to-three years to levels on par with investment grade issuers. The Company’s fundamental profile has improved which resulted in spread tightening. Given the yield currently offered on the Notes, Polen Capital sold down its exposure and used the proceeds to purchase higher yielding debt instruments.”\n\nGlobal Traffic Congestion Trends\n\nAccording to the TomTom Traffic Index, Dublin had the highest congestion percentage in the world in 2023. Despite having the highest congestion levels in the world, Dublin narrowly missed the spot of the most congested city in the world due to its lower average travel time per 10 km. Mexico, Lima, Bengaluru, and Bangkok are also among the top 10 cities with the worst traffic in the world. Meanwhile, in the United States, New York experienced the slowest traffic and the most congestion. It took NYC drivers an average of 23 minutes and 58 seconds to complete a typical six-mile trip. This figure reflected an increase of 19 seconds from 2022 and one minute 26 seconds from 2021. On the other hand, Detroit was considered one of the easiest cities to drive in the US, with drivers taking only eight minutes and 51 seconds to complete a typical six-mile trip. You can check out the 25 Most Congested Cities in the US here.\n\nIt is important to note that the speed of travel within a city is influenced not only by traffic volume but also by factors like road quality and natural obstacles such as hills and rivers, as indicated by a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. For instance, while cities like Nashville, Tampa, Austin, and Houston find themselves among the 25% most congested cities globally, they all rank in the top 10% in terms of travel time.\n\nWith this context in mind, let's take a look at our list of the most congested cities in the world. 35 Most Congested Cities in the World\n\nAI GR/Pixabay.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the most congested cities in the world, we consulted sources such as the TomTom Traffic Index and the National Bureau of Economic Research. These reports provided the latest statistics on various mobility metrics across cities globally. Key metrics considered in the ranking include congestion level, travel speed, time lost during rush hours, and overall average travel time. Each city is ranked in ascending order of the average travel time per 10 km in 2023. For cities with similar average travel times, we used the congestion levels as the tiebreaker. The congestion level represents the average extra time lost to traffic compared to driving in congestion-free conditions.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

According to the CME FedWatch tool, the fed funds futures market has priced in an approximately 97% probability that the central bank will leave rates unchanged during its Wednesday announcement and there’s a 48% probability of a rate cut at the next meeting in March. If the Fed signals a possible rate cut in March, the U.S. dollar will likely weaken against all major currencies. As such, Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP and WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund USDU might experience some declines. These two ETFs are the prime beneficiaries of the rising dollar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "The secret, insider’s guide on how to get hired at Elon Musk’s X",
        "content": "If the monotony of Big Tech has left you yawning, the “rest-and-vest” life isn’t really your style, you’ve never been a part of mass layoffs, and if you aren’t scared of the instability of an ad-driven social media company run by an owner who posts more than he sleeps—then you might just be the perfect fit for a gig at X.\n\nThe Elon Musk–owned site, which slashed roughly 75% of its staff in just over a year, is now hiring. X, which used to be known as Twitter, is seeking more than 70 brave souls to fill roles in engineering, sales, and operations.\n\nIt's not for everyone, of course. Those accustomed to free on-site restaurants, massages, and other classic Silicon Valley niceties need not apply. Musk eliminated most perks after taking over; he even sold the espresso machines. But there's a smorgasbord of challenges and long hours to feast on, if that's your jam, not to mention the chance to work for the world's (second) richest man.\n\nAnd, at a time when Google, Meta, Amazon, and other tech giants are laying workers off in droves, X can now claim to be an improbable beacon of opportunity for some, with job interviews in progress every week.\n\nWe sat down with someone involved in hiring at X, delving into the intricacies of the social media platform’s interview process. What you’ll need is proof of excellence, an extreme motivation to fight fires (think: moving hundreds of servers down the coast on Christmas Eve), and a hard-core attitude. It also doesn’t hurt to be a huge fan of Musk. After all, he has the final say on all hires.\n\nIndeed, several thousand applicants vied for internships at X last year, the source explained, with many Musk loyalists excited at the opportunity to work at one of Musk's six companies.\n\n\"The people who apply are pretty much Elon fans. They love Elon. They just see it as a good opportunity to work with him,” the source at X told Fortune. “They do ask if we have contact with him, things a regular person wouldn't really care about.”\n\nStory continues\n\nElon’s exceptional ensemble\n\nWhat’s important to remember is that X is a company that prides itself on rejecting red tape, bureaucracy, and any processes it views as getting in the way of action. That means the interview questions are unlikely to follow a preset script.\n\n\"It's basically asking whatever you feel like, test how the candidate is going to perform in the role, and then literally fill out a Google form. Rate one out of five and then mention your feedback, and then mention any red flags. That's it,\" the source explained.\n\nThe platform launched its own job board, so you won’t find listing for open roles like payment engineer and technical recruiter posted on LinkedIn or other job sites. Recent job listings tout a mission \"to foster freedom of speech and empower individuals to express themselves freely,\" and to \"create a platform for all perspectives\"—corporate objectives that can be seen in the reinstatement of banned users like Alex Jones and Andrew Tate, as well as the reported spike in hate speech since Musk took over the platform (content moderators, meanwhile, may find work at X too, following the company's recently announced plans to hire 100 people in Texas to police the site for child sexual exploitation content).\n\nCompany values to keep in mind when applying to join team X are \"shipping code rather than talking about road maps\" and creating \"big features rather changing button colors.\" X did not respond to Fortune's request to talk about its hiring process.\n\nJust to get you in the door, the application will ask you to describe “what exceptional work” you’ve done. It's an intimidating prompt that requires the usual flair for self-aggrandizement (Instead of just saying \"worked at Google,\" for instance, explain how you increased revenue in Google Ads by launching a key update in a certain number of days), but one that may not be as selective as it seems.\n\n“What they're looking for in an exceptional employee is very different from how we're actually working nowadays,” the source said, adding that the reality at X is more simple than the exceptional criteria makes it seem. While Musk and his crew at the top might be keen to hire “people who have been engineers for 20 years and done incredible things on paper,” the source explained that those folks don't always have the most impressive, or relevant, coding chops. Sure, they might have decades of experience, but when was the last time they got down and dirty with a code editor?\n\nIf your application does get picked out of the pile, applicants can expect the same technical interview rigor as most Big Tech roles require. The interview process starts with an initial contact from the in-house recruiter, followed by technical screenings and on-site interviews (typically in San Francisco, which is where X focuses its U.S hiring efforts).\n\n“[Interview] problems depend on the interviewer. We have a bank of questions, but it’s ultimately up to them,” the source explained. “Some prefer hard algorithmic questions; some prefer more practical ones.”\n\nThe final decision involves a huddle with interviewers, and yes, Musk really does have the ultimate say. (He used to meet candidates at the beginning, the source said, but now he just reviews the application and gives a yes or no answer.) What’s most unconventional is that Musk prefers candidates who have not been laid off, no matter the reason, and cultural fit is essential, the source said.\n\n“If you’ve been laid off, you shouldn’t even waste your time applying,” the source explained. It’s worth noting, though, that after Musk laid off half of the company, X asked dozens of them to return after realizing they were necessary to the operation.\n\nIf you haven’t been scared off yet, congrats, you’re now an employee at X! The pay is still competitive; you can expect anywhere from $100,000 to $300,000 in base pay and restricted stock units on top of it, depending on the role and location. You’ll see Elon sparingly in the San Francisco office; he’s been spending more and more time in Austin lately. When you do cross his path, whether it be in the weekly engineering meeting or elsewhere, don’t contradict him and “don’t make shit up.”\n\nOh, and don’t call it Twitter.\n\nDo you have insight to share?

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nOn January 30, Asian stock markets experienced a decline, with China bearing the brunt of the downturn, amid growing concerns among investors. This pessimism in the market is putting pressure on policymakers in China to consider implementing rate cuts in order to stimulate economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Specifically, stock prices in Hong Kong saw a drop of approximately 2%, while mainland China stocks were on track for a third consecutive day of decline. The recent liquidation order issued against China Evergrande Group on Monday intensified market anxieties, leading to a notable 4% decrease in a Bloomberg index tracking Chinese developers. The Evergrande liquidation saga has cast a shadow over both the Chinese and Hong Kong markets, prompting investors to reassess their positions and adopt a cautious approach. This development underscores the significant influence that regulatory and economic factors in China can have on global financial markets. As market sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty looms, investors are closely monitoring the situation and its potential implications for broader market dynamics. The possibility of rate cuts by Chinese policymakers is being closely watched as investors seek clues about the future direction of economic policy and its impact on market stability.\n\nThe oil market remained stable as investors awaited the United States' response to the recent deadly attack on American troops in Jordan, reported Bloomberg. This attack has the potential to escalate tensions in a region crucial to global crude production. Brent crude futures were trading above $82 per barrel following a 1.4% decline on Monday, despite the drone strike targeting US soldiers. Iran has attempted to distance itself from the attack. Additionally, data indicating that OPEC+ is making a sluggish start to implementing new output cuts contributed to downward pressure on oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also showed little movement amidst the uncertainty. Oil traders are closely monitoring developments, particularly any indications of the US government's response to the attack. There are concerns that any action taken by the US could further heighten tensions in the region, potentially impacting oil supply and prices. As a result, market participants are proceeding cautiously, awaiting clarity on the situation and its potential implications for the oil market.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets. Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\nWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\n10. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nOn January 29, Barclays analyst Mario Lu reiterated his Underweight rating on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) while adjusting the price target upwards from $100 to $110. This decision comes amidst ongoing scrutiny and cautious sentiment regarding the company's performance and valuation. Despite the upward revision in the price target, Lu maintains a conservative stance on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) outlook, suggesting that the stock may not offer significant upside potential in the near term. The decision to maintain the Underweight rating indicates Barclays' skepticism about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) ability to justify its current valuation. The revised price target of $110 suggests that Barclays anticipates limited growth prospects for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), especially considering the prevailing market conditions and the company's financial performance. While the price target raise acknowledges certain positive factors, such as the company's strong brand recognition and market presence, it also underscores the cautious approach taken by analysts like Lu. As of the closing bell on January 29, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock was trading at $152.70, reflecting the market's reaction to the revised price target and Barclays' assessment of the company's valuation.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were Illumina, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Microsoft. Airbnb continues to deliver double-digit growth in revenue and nights booked, which is especially impressive given the year-ago growth rates it delivered on these same metrics (+29% and +31, respectively). Despite these attractive results, the stock sold off as investors reacted to fourth quarter guidance that came in slightly below expectations. Coming into the fourth quarter, the stock was up +60% on the back of strong fundamentals. Stepping back, nothing has changed. Private rentals continue to take market share from hotels globally, and Airbnb continues to take market share within private rentals given its relentless focus on improving the guest and host experience. Looking ahead, we expect many years of robust earnings and cash flow growth from here.”\n\n09. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nUpside Potential: 4%\n\nOn January 29, Baird analyst William Power increased the price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $186.00 to $200.00, affirming an Outperform rating. This adjustment reflects Baird's optimistic outlook on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) performance and potential within the technology sector. With a revised price target suggesting a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, the analyst's move indicates confidence in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ability to continue delivering value to investors. The decision to maintain the Outperform rating underscores Baird's belief in Apple's strong position in the industry and its ability to outperform market expectations. The raised price target of $200.00 reflects Baird's positive assessment of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth prospects, innovation pipeline, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was trading at $191.73, indicating a modest premium over the revised price target set by Baird.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. While on a total attribution basis, Apple was not a top three detractor to our full-year return, given its extremely large weighting in the Index, we feel it’s worth sharing our thoughts.\n\nThe company’s share price appreciated nearly 50% in a year when its revenue declined and earnings per share was relatively flat with the previous year.\n\nFor 2024, consensus expectations are for low-single-digit revenue growth and only slightly faster EPS growth. These pedestrian growth rates are not surprising for a company with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue. What is more surprising is that Apple shares trade at nearly 30x forward earnings, a large premium to the market and many faster-growing, competitively advantaged businesses.\n\nWhile we continue to think Apple is a wonderful business, it is also a slow growing one with risks that we do not see as insignificant. Apple’s entire supply chain is based in China and much of its incremental revenue growth also comes from China, so if there is a U.S.-China issue that makes it more difficult for U.S.-based companies that have access to large amounts of local data to operate in China, Apple’s business would likely face more challenges than many others. In addition, much of Apple’s services growth and margin expansion has come from direct payments from Google to be the default search provider on iOS devices. This practice is currently the subject of a lawsuit between Google and the U.S. Justice Department. If this practice is deemed unlawful, it could take away a large and highly profitable revenue stream from Apple’s already slow growth engine. While we closely cover Apple, we continue to believe we have better investment opportunities. Apple’s current P/E is above our Portfolio’s weighted average, yet its long-term earnings growth rate is likely to be lower than even our slowest growing holding, according to our research.”\n\n08. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nUpside Potential: 4%\n\nOn January 29, Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger increased the price target for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) from $610.00 to $678.00, upholding an Outperform rating. This adjustment underscores Oppenheimer's positive outlook on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) prospects within the software and financial technology industry. With the revised price target indicating a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, Schneeberger's move reflects confidence in Intuit's ability to deliver value to investors. Maintaining the Outperform rating signals Oppenheimer's belief in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) competitive positioning and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $678.00 reflects Oppenheimer's bullish stance on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) long-term growth prospects, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock was trading at $652.88, indicating a slight premium over the revised price target set by Oppenheimer.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Following significant under-performance, some high-quality businesses in these sectors are now becoming more attractive from a valuation perspective – in our language they are now getting warmer on our Bench of potential investments.\n\nOur ‘all-weather’ portfolio centred around our unique definition of ‘quality’ delivered strong performance in the September quarter. Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Natural Resource Partners, in alphabetical order), and another three companies almost reached this level of positive contribution. No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.\n\nAs part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.\n\nIntuit held its annual Investor Day during the quarter and the presentation materials are well-worth a review. Intuit is at the forefront of commercial application of artificial intelligence (AI) across its portfolio of businesses – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. Intuit has been investing in AI for many years, well before ChatGPT became a buzz word…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n07. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nUpside Potential: 7%\n\nOn January 29, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson increased the price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from $153 to $165 while affirming an Overweight rating. This adjustment reflects Keybanc's optimistic outlook on Alphabet's prospects within the technology and internet services industry. With the revised price target suggesting a 7% upside potential compared to the current market price, Patterson's decision underscores confidence in Alphabet's ability to generate value for investors. By maintaining the Overweight rating, Keybanc expresses its conviction in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) competitive position and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $165 reflects Keybanc's bullish perspective on Alphabet's long-term growth potential, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It indicates that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. At the closing time on January 29, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock was trading at $153.51, signaling a slight premium over the revised price target set by Keybanc. This adjustment is expected to influence investor sentiment and contribute to ongoing discussions about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) position as a leading player in the technology and internet services market.\n\n06. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nUpside Potential: 9%\n\nOn January 29, Morgan Stanley raised its target price on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares from $39.00 to $48.00, while maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating. This adjustment reflects Morgan Stanley's assessment of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) position within the semiconductor industry and its outlook for the company's future performance. With the revised target price suggesting a 9% upside potential compared to the current market price, Morgan Stanley's decision underscores a moderate level of optimism regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) prospects. By maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating, Morgan Stanley acknowledges Intel's strengths and weaknesses relative to its peers in the industry. This rating suggests that Intel's performance is expected to align with the broader market trends, without significant outperformance or underperformance. The raised target price of $48.00 reflects Morgan Stanley's belief in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) ability to execute its strategic initiatives and drive shareholder value over the long term. It indicates that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting a favorable investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was trading at $43.84, indicating a potential upside from the revised target price set by Morgan Stanley.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now 11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli Billionaire Mason Hawkins’ 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Microsoft set for AI-powered revenue surge. (VIEW press via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report a 15.8% jump in quarterly revenue, its best growth in nearly two years, after the closing bell on Tuesday.\n\nMicrosoft has outperformed the broader market, with shares of the software giant surging over 50% growth in the past year and its market capitalisation hitting $3tn (£2.36tn).\n\nMicrosoft is currently the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, beating longtime rival Apple (AAPL).\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street expects Microsoft to post adjusted earnings per share of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1bn, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a jump from the same quarter last year when the company posted an EPS of $2.32 on revenue of $52.7bn.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Markets up in Europe as HSBC fined £57.4m\n\nThe key metric for investors to keep an eye on will be growth in Microsoft's Azure cloud business.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)\n\nThe parent company of Google is scheduled to announce its Q4 results during Tuesday’s post-market session.\n\nWall Street analysts maintain a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus \"Buy\" rating.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.60, indicating 52.4% growth from the previous year’s reported figure.\n\nRead more: What to expect from the Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia\n\nAlphabet's revenue is expected to be $85.24bn (£67bn), up from $76.05bn in the fourth quarter of 2022. Analysts anticipate net income to be $20.28bn, up from $13.62bn in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFurther integration of Bard with Google apps and services will also be on the lookout, but no doubt it will be a race against time against Microsoft, which has been a first-mover with its ChatGPT.\n\n“Alphabet has beaten market expectations for both earnings per share and revenue over the past three consecutive quarterly results. Investors will be hoping it can make it four in a row,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD (AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), which last month launched a new AI-focused chip aimed at challenging the early market dominance of Nvidia (NVDA), has added more than $130bn to its overall market value over the past three months.\n\nWall Street is betting its earnings will provide further proof of AMD’s AI chip potential when the company reports its results later on Tuesday.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe consensus estimate is for AMD to release revenue of $6.13bn with adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents for the quarter ending December. Analysts estimate the current quarter’s revenue is $5.73bn with EPS of 67 cents.\n\nThe company got a show of support last week when Elon Musk said he would buy its chips to power artificial-intelligence efforts at Tesla (TSLA).\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nHSBC shares were lower after the lender was fined £57.4m by the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) for “serious failings” over customer deposit protection – the second highest penalty ever imposed by the financial watchdog.\n\nThe PRA said HSBC failed “over many years” to properly put in place the requirements to protect saver deposits dating back to 2015.\n\nThe regulator said that among its failings, HSBC incorrectly marked 99% of eligible beneficiary deposits as being “ineligible” for protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\n\nHSBC’s fine was reduced from an initial £96.5m for co-operation with the investigation, early admission of rule breaches and agreeing to resolve the matter, according to the PRA.\n\nWatch: Tech earnings, JOLTS data: What to Watch<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-why-big-tech-earnings-are-critical-for-the-health-of-the-market-rally-160444587.html\\\">earnings from Big Tech</a> companies Microsoft (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">MSFT</a>) and Alphabet (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG?p=GOOG&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">GOOG</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL?p=GOOGL&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">GOOGL</a>), and economic data such as Consumer Confidence and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS).</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-scraps-irobot-deal-sofi-183515468.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.</p>\\n<p><em>Editor's note: This article was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:6;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/luke-carberry-mogan/\\\"><em>Luke Carberry Mogan</em></a><em>.</em>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/keqKOGHrc6t2S7LksTDk4w--~B/aD0yODE1O3c9NTAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-01/5e2b55a0-bef4-11ee-bfa7-6076686eece8\",\"duration\":\"PT54S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/bb918711-d476-3ebc-ba8b-1eaa24cd5115.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-earnings-jolts-data-watch-221913113.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"bb918711-d476-3ebc-ba8b-1eaa24cd5115\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures hovered broadly around the flatline on Tuesday, with traders gearing up for a flurry of earnings, data, and central bank decisions this week. Artificial intelligence is set to be a major focus in the latest quarterly reports from tech behemoths Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) later today. Boeing (NYSE:BA) scraps an application to speed up the official certification of its upcoming 737 Max 7 jet following heavy scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers.\n\n1. Futures subdued\n\nU.S. stock futures were subdued on Tuesday, as investors awaited the release of fresh earnings from several big-name companies, a bevy of key economic data, and a major Federal Reserve policy decision.\n\nBy 05:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 44 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 2 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly flat.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session, with the benchmark S&P 500 in particular surging by 0.8% to a fresh record high close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped by 1.12% and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) slumped by 8.8% after the robot vacuum maker and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced they had mutually agreed to terminate a planned merger due to opposition from EU antitrust regulators. Elsewhere, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) soared by 20.2% after the online personal finance group posted better-than-anticipated quarterly profit.\n\n2. Microsoft, Alphabet earnings ahead\n\nTech giant Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet are set to unveil their latest quarterly earnings after the close of trading in New York on Tuesday, in the first wave of potentially market-moving corporate results this week.\n\nFor Microsoft, the figures come after the Redmond, Washington-based company's stock market value topped $3 trillion for the first time ever last week.\n\nUndergirding this sky-high valuation is Microsoft's investment in OpenAI, whose ChatGPT chatbot has become one of the focal points of recent growing enthusiasm over generative artificial intelligence. Analysts will likely be paying close attention to any comments from the firm's executives regarding how they hope to deploy the nascent technology, particularly at its crucial Azure cloud computing division.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, has recently launched its own advanced AI play, dubbed Gemini. The YouTube-owner has lauded this model as a sophisticated tool for crunching disparate pieces of information like video, text, and audio, with Chief Executive Sundar Pichai calling it \"one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we've undertaken.\"\n\nAI will also be front-and-center for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) when the chipmaker posts results after the bell later today. Analysts already hiked their price target for the semiconductor group earlier this month, citing the benefits of elevated demand for AI-powered chips.\n\n3. Boeing withdraws request for 737 Max 7 safety exemption\n\nBoeing has confirmed that it is withdrawing its request for a safety exemption for a new series of its popular 737 Max planes, as the jetmaker wrangles with the continuing fallout from a dangerous mid-air door plug breach earlier this month.\n\nThe exemption would have allowed U.S. regulators to expedite the process of approving Boeing's upcoming 737 Max 7. Investors had widely anticipated that it would receive the official green light in the first half of this year.\n\nMore doubt now surrounds the timeline for the much-anticipated certification of both the Max 7 and Boeing's larger Max 10. According to Reuters, the company may be forced to roll out design changes more quickly than it had originally planned.\n\nBoeing's decision also comes after it faced heavy pressure from U.S. lawmakers last week to withdraw its application for the exemption. U.S. Senator and aviation subcommittee chair Tammy Duckworth took a particularly strong stance against the request, arguing that it could have \"catastrophic consequences on passenger safety.\"\n\n4. BYD shares slip after disappointing profit forecast\n\nBYD (SZ:002594), the Warren Buffett-backed group that recently dethroned Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world's biggest electric vehicle (EV) maker by sales volume, has forecast full-year profit that missed analyst expectations, sending shares lower on Tuesday.\n\nThe Chinese EV company said it now expects to report annual profit of between 29 billion yuan and 31 billion yuan, implying a rise of as much as 86.49% versus the prior year. However, the pace would be far slower than its 2022 net earnings growth of 446%.\n\nAnalysts at Nomura noted that the outlook was 4% to 10% below their projections, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a research note.\n\nBYD flagged that it was facing \"fierce competition\" in China's EV industry, which has contributed to an intensifying price war among domestic automakers desperate to entice cost-wary consumers. Even still, the Shenzhen-based company said it has demonstrated \"strong resilience\" to these pressures, adding that it has been boosted by \"rapid\" expansion in overseas sales and expense reductions in its supply chain.\n\n5. Crude inches up amid Middle East tensions\n\nOil prices inched up on Tuesday after the previous session’s losses, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East fueled supply concerns.\n\nBy 05:01 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.5% higher at $77.13 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed by $82.15 per barrel.\n\nCrude markets are on edge after the U.S. vowed to take \"all necessary actions\" to defend its troops following a deadly drone attack in Jordan by Iran-backed militants, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nThe crude contracts fell over $1 on Monday as a deepening real estate crisis contributed to worries about demand from China, the world's biggest crude consumer.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Tuesday, as investors awaited regional growth data, the start of the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year and earnings from some tech giants.\n\nAt 03:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France traded up 0.2% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. rose 0.3%.\n\nEurozone GDP release on focus\n\nThe main European indices started the new week on a cautious note, but the underlying tone remains positive as investors look to the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve, to soon start cutting interest rates to support the region’s economic recovery.\n\nWith this in mind, investors will study the release of gross domestic product data in the eurozone, France and Germany for the fourth quarter, with weak figures likely to heap the pressure on ECB officials to start easing monetary policy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also starts its two-day policy-setting meeting later in the session, and while the U.S. central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged investors will be looking for clues over when rate cuts are likely to start.\n\nDiageo hit by fall in earnings\n\nIn the corporate sector, Diageo (LON:DGE) stock fell 4% after the U.K. spirits manufacturer reported a decline in earnings as demand for expensive spirits slumped in the Americas, suggesting the sector was struggling to attract discretionary spending.\n\nBBVA (BME:BBVA) stock rose 0.2% after the Spanish lender announced plans for a hefty share buyback as fourth-quarter net profit climbed on higher income, taking its full-year result to a new record.\n\nRenault (EPA:RENA) stock rose around 2% after the French auto giant called off plans to list its electric vehicle business Ampere because of sluggish stock market conditions\n\nHowever, a lot of the attention in the corporate world Tuesday will be on the U.S. tech sector, with the mega-cap companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) set to report later in the session.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrude steadies as Middle East tensions escalate\n\nOil prices steadied Tuesday after the previous session’s losses, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East fuelled supply concerns.\n\nBy 03:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $76.80 a barrel, while the Brent contract traded flat at $81.82 a barrel.\n\nCrude markets are on edge after the U.S. vowed to take \"all necessary actions\" to defend its troops following a deadly drone attack in Jordan by Iran-backed militants, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nThe crude contracts fell over $1 on Monday as a deepening real estate crisis fuelled worries about demand from China, the world's biggest crude consumer.\n\nAdditionally, gold futures rose 0.6% to $2,055.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0825.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Vision Pro Is a Potential Silver Lining",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.\n\nLooking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.\n\nAccording to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.\n\nThere is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.\n\nApple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.\n\nToday, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.\n\nThe relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.\n\nApple’s Scale Problem\n\nApple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.\n\nThe problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.\n\nEven if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.\n\nIs Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nApple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple’s prospects, but they’re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here’s what some analysts have said about Apple.\n\nOn January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock’s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.\n\nOn January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.\n\nLast week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.\n\nOverall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.\n\nThe Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not\n\nApple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Alphabet, Meta ad sales in Q4 unlikely to reflect gen AI investments",
        "content": "By Sheila Dang\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Despite the buzz over generative artificial intelligence last year, the technology's impact on the advertising business of Alphabet and Meta Platforms is likely to be muted when the companies report fourth-quarter results this week, though investors are mapping out its future potential.\n\nThe search giant has rolled out AI tools that help advertisers target audiences in a less costly way and decide how their marketing budgets should be distributed across Google's ad network. Facebook parent Meta is using generative AI to create different variations of ad campaigns.\n\nGenerative AI, which can create text and photos from prompts, is still in the \"hype cycle,\" Bernstein analysts said in a research note earlier this month, but added that investors were now looking for \"incremental use cases and revenue streams to spawn from these recent advancements.\"\n\nThe core business of digital advertising is expected to have been resilient in the quarter ended Dec. 31, and warnings that economic and geopolitical uncertainty could dampen the ad market are likely to prove overblown, the brokerage said in a separate note last week.\n\nMicrosoft, which is scheduled to report quarterly results on Tuesday, is likely to be the earliest winner in the nascent generative AI race, which has consumed nearly every tech and social media company from Amazon.com to Snap. For Microsoft, generative AI has fueled demand for its cloud services.\n\nAlphabet stock surged 58% last year, while Meta's stock nearly tripled. The broader S&P 500 index gained roughly a quarter in 2023, helped by an AI-fueled tech rally.\n\nGoing into 2024, \"an additional catalyst ... other than AI, will be the big focus on political advertising and will boost businesses at Meta and Google,\" said D.A. Davidson and Co analyst Gil Luria.\n\nSpending on political advertising in the U.S. will jump 30% this year from the last presidential election in 2020, partly driven by higher spending on digital platforms, research firm Insider Intelligence has estimated.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Tuesday, Google parent Alphabet is expected to report that fourth-quarter advertising revenue - its mainstay - grew 11.8% to $66 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nGoogle introduced its experimental AI chatbot Bard early last year and launched what it calls a search generative experience (SGE) that generates written responses to some Google Search queries.\n\nIt rolled out SGE to 120 countries in November, but the new search experience could have very little impact on its business in the near-term.\n\nBy 2025, SGE could account for between $35.6 million and $113 million in incremental search advertising revenue in the \"upside scenarios,\" said New Street Research analysts in a research report in October, adding that the biggest factor depends on how often people click on ads shown in AI-generated responses.\n\nAI POTENTIAL\n\nMeta, the second-largest digital ad platform, has already proven that its work in AI can produce results for its advertisers.\n\nIn a survey of advertisers who tested Meta's AI tools that can generate images and backgrounds for ads, half said they estimated the tools could save them at least five hours of work per week, Bernstein analysts said.\n\nAfter cautioning in October that the Israel-Hamas conflict could hurt ad spending, analysts estimate Meta will report $39.1 billion in fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday, at the higher end of Meta's guidance.\n\nA suite of AI tools that automatically finds potential customers and tests which ads will perform best is earning $10 billion on an annualized basis, Meta has said.\n\nIf the company introduces paid ads later this year within the AI assistants it recently launched to answer questions inside WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, it could generate $6.7 billion in ad revenue in 2025, New Street Research estimated.\n\nSuch ads could also be a much-needed boon for Snap, owner of photo messaging app Snapchat, which partnered with Microsoft in September to place sponsored product links in its chatbot called My AI.\n\nNew Street Research estimated Snap will earn $234 million this year from these links, which will grow to $686 million in 2025, or more than 11% of annual revenue. Analysts estimate Snap will report fourth-quarter revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5.7% from the previous year.\n\nAmazon.com, which will begin showing ads on its Prime Video service this week, is building partnerships for Amazon Bedrock, a service that lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, RBC Capital Markets said.\n\nThe launch of Prime Video ads could boost Amazon's ad revenue growth by 5% to 10%, RBC Capital Markets said in its 2024 outlook report. The retail giant reports results on Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin, Texas; Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "Microsoft earnings: Tech giant to report Q2 earnings as AI mania pushes stock higher",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday as Wall Street looks for signs that the company’s vast artificial intelligence investments continue to pay off. Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft’s market capitalization over $3 trillion.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street expects Microsoft to post adjusted earnings per share of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a jump from the same quarter last year when the company posted an EPS of $2.32 on revenue of $52.7 billion.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure service, is expected to bring in $25.3 billion in the quarter, up from the $21.5 billion it generated in Q2 last year. Overall Microsoft Cloud revenue is estimated to top $32.2 billion, versus $27.1 billion last year. Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella during a press event at CES 2024. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images) (Ethan Miller via Getty Images)\n\nOn the productivity side of things, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes revenue should top out at $19 billion, according to analyst estimates, up from $17 billion in Q2 last year.\n\nThe company’s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, is expected to generate $16.8 billion, up from $14.2 billion in the prior year.\n\nMicrosoft’s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\n\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot’s more advanced features.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year, as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\n\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and, in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\n\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently, as users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, it’s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it’s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.\n\nNow Microsoft and its ilk have to continue to prove the hype, and cash they spent, is worth it.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "One chart shows why Big Tech earnings are critical for the health of the market rally",
        "content": "The stock market is still all about tech.\n\nNew data from FactSet shows that while strategists have called for a broadening out of the market rally, big tech companies are expected to be the drivers of Q4 earnings growth in the S&P 500.\n\nEarnings for Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to grow a combined 53.7% in the fourth quarter. The other 494 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see a 10.5% decline.\n\nFive of those companies —Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta — are set to report quarterly results this week.\n\nAfter the remaining Magnificent Seven tech stock, Tesla (TSLA), disappointed with its report, Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nThe expectations for some names are massive. Nvidia is expected to grow earnings per share by more than 400% compared to the same period a year prior. Analysts project Meta's earnings per share to grow 175% from the same period a year prior.\n\nThe eye-popping growth for some of the largest stocks in the market is expected to continue next quarter, too. A second chart from FactSet shows that Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are expected to grow earnings by nearly 80% in the first quarter of 2024. The other 496 companies, including Apple Microsoft and Tesla, are expected to grow earnings by a combined 0.3%.\n\n\"Their earnings are incredible compared to the rest of the market,\" JJ Kinahan, IG North America's CEO told Yahoo Finance Live. \"You don't often see this where a few stocks are so outperforming the rest of the market.\"\n\nTo some on Wall Street, these massive earnings expectations help explain why the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs and still might not be overvalued.\n\n\"There's more growth in that [S&P 500] valuation now than there used to be,\" Pettit said, nodding to the increased position of technology in the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the market's recent rally, nearly 90% of the growth seen in January has also been driven by the same tech companies excluding Tesla, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. This comes after the seven tech companies were the major market driver in 2023, and it creates a simple reason for why investors will be watching these reports closely.\n\nStill tech earnings expectations go beyond just the quarterly numbers. It's about updates on various market-moving narratives during earnings calls, too.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been at the center of earnings improvements for Meta and Nvidia. Microsoft and Amazon both have AI plays, too, but their cloud revenues are typically more closely scrutinized. Additionally, Apple's products business can provide a lens into demand for hardware and the overall state of consumer spending.\n\nAll of this combines to make tech earnings crucial for the market — not only because people expect Big Tech to do well but because if their results miss estimates, the lagging parts of their business could be a flashing a warning sign about an economic slowdown.

        "content": "Who says January’s a long month? This week starts slow, but we’ll end it with a full-fledged Jobs Week for February. Tuesday ushers in new JOLTS data for December, Wednesday brings us private-sector ADP ADP payroll totals for this month (along with the latest Fed decision on interest rates), and Friday is the big non-farm payroll survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). All of the forecast numbers are expected to tick down in the labor market, aside from the Unemployment Rate, which is expected to lift back up slightly to 3.8%.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our new week also features several marquee names of the Tech industry reporting earnings: Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL on Tuesday, Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN on Thursday — all after the closing bell, as per normal. These major firms are all expecting growth on both top and bottom lines, year over year, led by anticipated earnings growth of +285% from Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Amazon, and +15% revenues growth year over year from Zacks Rank #2-rated Microsoft. (In other news, Amazon is no longer pursuing the acquisition for iRobot, citing antitrust issues, sending the smaller stock down -20% at this hour.)\r\n\r\nElsewhere, there will be a bevy of other reports hitting the tape this week, from Case-Shiller home prices to Consumer Confidence to Q4 Productivity to S&P and ISM Manufacturing. We also look for fresh Q4 earnings reports from across the spectrum of sectors, from AMD AMD to General Motors GM to Mondelez MDLZ to Pfizer PFE to Snapchat SNAP and Starbucks SBUX — and that’s just tomorrow!\r\n\r\nOff near-term lows on January 18th, three of the four major stock market indices have rebounded into positive territory year-to-date. Only the Russell 2000 is still -3% from the start of this year’s trading, though that’s up from -6% on January 18th. The small-cap index, heavy in regional bank representation, needs three relatively strong trading days to finish the month in the green, along with the others which are already there.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision to be any factor at all on trading behavior this week. Even among those analysts who still believe — or wish for — six interest rate cuts between now and the end of the year do not foresee one coming this early. Most of these folks look toward early March for the first cut, though this would likely take much weaker numbers in the economy before the Fed would risk loosening the monetary screws.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "AI’s path in 2024: Another year of growth instead of monetization",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence has captured the world’s imagination, but for 2024, investors shouldn’t expect to see much in the way of financial tailwinds yet — outside a couple of exceptions to the rule.\n\nDirect monetization of AI services will remain out of reach for most companies, Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance. While businesses are ramping up their AI usage, software makers will likely include AI features as a perk of their existing offerings or as a way to prompt upgrades instead of a paid standalone product.\n\n“The tools built around generative AI are compelling, but they are in their infancy. They're still working out the kinks,” said Luria. “The inclination from companies … will be to bundle these offerings in order to drive adoption, so we're still probably a little bit farther away from being a material growth driver.”\n\nTell that to investors who have become enthralled with the AI trade.\n\nSoftware ETF IGV is up roughly 50% over the past year, compared to a 34% gain for the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and 20% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). The outsized performance is mostly driven by AI excitement, said Luria. \"We believe most software companies will face a headwind to their stocks if they don't deliver tangible AI results [this year].\"\n\nMicrosoft still leads the industry, Salesforce well positioned\n\nThe outliers are Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) — both D.A. Davidson’s top picks for mega caps due to their advanced AI abilities and solid businesses outside of the field.\n\nAdobe, a leader in text-to-image generation, has incorporated generative AI features across its creative suites, with a generative AI credits system that entices users to pay more to use those functions. Executive Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Corporation, Satya Nadella, speaks during a talk about Microsoft's vision for AI at Chatham House, in London, Britain, January 15, 2024. REUTERS/Anna Gordon (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMicrosoft, with its Copilot services, is charging users extra for accessing the AI assistants embedded within Microsoft 365, GitHub, and more.\n\nBut the real AI cash cow will remain its cloud service, Azure, which provides access to OpenAI's and others' large language models (LLMs) that developers can use to build their own applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile monetization might not come right away, software that aids client-facing roles is well positioned for the future. Generative AI’s potential has been touted as almost limitless, but the proven use cases currently focus on text generation, text summation, and text-to-image generation, per Luria.\n\nThese use cases are most relevant in tasks like pre-populating emails, summarizing calls, and answering common questions — all functions built into Salesforce’s (CRM) AI assistant, Einstein Copilot, which is targeting the end of February for a public launch.\n\nMorgan Stanley recently upgraded the company's stock to a top pick, citing its consistent revenue growth and relatively muted trading multiples compared to its peers.\n\nData is worth gold in the AI age, so investors should look for firms that lead the field in data access and integration. Salesforce, for example, already hosts a wealth of data from companies using its products to automate customer service, marketing, and other tasks.\n\nIn December, the enterprise SaaS giant announced a new capability to import unstructured data — think emails and phone calls instead of entries in databases — into its Data Cloud product, which connects data from its various software offerings.\n\nMore data is the solution to hallucinations, or false answers.\n\n“One of the most common ways to improve a hallucination or prevent a hallucination is to provide more context,” Patrick Stokes, executive vice president of product and industries marketing at Salesforce, told Yahoo Finance. “If we can connect the business context into the prompt, the LLM now has the additional information it needs.”\n\nThe future: Smaller models, bots talking to bots\n\nThough large, universal knowledge models like ChatGPT grab all the attention, companies pioneering more efficient models will be the ones raking in the cash. Workers at lamp makers don’t need help drafting emails about the Roman Empire. Smaller models containing only the pertinent information would cost less to operate — and thus, easier for businesses to profit from. Such efforts are underway at Microsoft and Salesforce, among others.\n\n“We learned that the company has recently formed an internal team to develop smaller AI models (SLMs) to make AI cheaper to run and seemingly reduce dependencies on OpenAI. These SLMs, such as Phi-2 and Kosmos-2 are intended to rival performance of larger models with significantly fewer parameters,” Citi analysts wrote after attending Microsoft’s AI tour last week.\n\nWhat’s in enterprise AI’s future? One day soon, we may see bots talking to bots — an AI assistant managing your calendar collaborating with an AI assistant handling your client information — as platforms become more interoperable.\n\n“It's like the assistants start helping each other to help the end user,” predicted Nick Johnson, Salesforce’s senior vice president of strategic partnerships.\n\nIf these assistants can program profits for their masters, investors would be all the better.\n\nJennifer Wang is a senior editor at Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Big Tech earnings: What markets are expecting this week",
        "content": "Big Tech is next up at bat to report earnings this week, mainly five of the Magnificent Seven components — Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nYahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer explains market commentary on projected earnings growth for these mega-cap tech companies.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- And tech is on deck this week. Some of the stock market's largest technology companies set to report earnings. And for more on how the reports may impact markets, we've got Yahoo Finance's very own Josh Schafer to help us give the rundown for the week ahead.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad. So you take a look at that list we just showed five of the so-called Magnificent Seven. And when you think about Tesla's performance a week ago, maybe we're talking more of a Super Six here and not a Magnificent Seven. So really, you're only missing NVIDIA in terms of massive tech companies to report this week.\n\nAnd really, guys, I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market and the fundamental story that we're seeing in the stock market. So when you take a look at the earnings projections for the six companies-- I'm going to say six here because we're including NVIDIA in the graphic that we're showing, but they're projected to grow earnings-- this is data from FactSet-- at nearly 54% year over year for the fourth quarter.\n\nLook at the other 494 companies. They're expected to have earnings fall 10.5%. So when you think about why stocks move higher and what people are buying, you're buying earnings, right? You want earnings to eventually go up. That is the story of the stock market in the long term. And that's why the short-term story of the stock market has really just been these six stocks. This is what we're waiting for. This is what we-- this is the big moment.\n\nStory continues\n\n- This is what we're waiting for. It's a big moment. And then you pair that also with the jobs data that we're going to be getting out on Friday, the Fed decision on Wednesday. I know you closely are following that as well, Josh.\n\nIn terms of investors' view on this, in terms of the big driver of the market or the key thing that traders are going to be listening for obviously a lot of that's going to be surrounding the timing of that first cut. But beyond that, what do you think has the potential to move the markets this week?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. I mean, it seems like overall, we're still in the soft landing is probably consensus and probably to the upside, right, as far as what people are expecting. So anything that doesn't give us that, when you're thinking maybe a really cool jobs report, perhaps the Fed talking about cutting later than people think or being more restrictive than people think, or I do think the fundamental earnings story from tech because of where the overall S&P is at right now.\n\nI did a story over the weekend about the S&P being potentially overvalued and what strategists say about that. Well, they talk about if you really think about what's in the S&P, you're buying future earnings growth, right? And if you get that earnings growth from these big companies, then one could argue the S&P 500 at a record high isn't overvalued, and it has room to keep growing.\n\nSo you get all three aspects this week, right? We talk about the Fed a lot. That can move your major indexes and move things. We talked about the Mag Seven. We're getting that. And we've got a jobs report on Friday because why not?\n\n- So I guess we'll talk on Friday, and we'll decide what the biggest mover was of the week.\n\n- Certainly setting up to be a very busy week here potentially for the markets. Josh, great stuff. Thanks so much.",

        "title": "Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 29, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\n\nBig Tech Earnings Loom: What Can Investors Expect?\n\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\n\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\n\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\n\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\n\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\n\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\n\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\n\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\n\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\n\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\n\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\n\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

        "title": "Chinese AR Glasses Maker Raises $60 Million to Compete With Apple",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Augmented reality glasses maker Xreal is raising fresh funding at a valuation that tops $1 billion, according to Chief Executive Officer Chi Xu, aiming to get out ahead of future devices from Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTraders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Musk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts Amazon Drops iRobot Deal; Roomba Maker Cuts 31% of Staff\n\nThe Chinese startup is raising $60 million in the round, bringing its total to more than $300 million, Chi said in an interview. That latest money comes from a key supply chain partner that he declined to identify.\n\n“This will help us scale our manufacturing capabilities and research and development,” he said, adding that the company has enough capacity to meet demand for its glasses this year but needs the money to fulfill orders in 2025.\n\nXreal is looking to blaze a trail in augmented reality — technology that overlays data and imagery over real-world views. The company accounted for about half of the market for AR-only devices in the third quarter of last year, according to research firm IDC. The larger combined virtual reality and AR market — known as mixed reality — features Meta as the leader, followed by Sony Group Corp. and ByteDance Ltd. Xreal holds about 4% of the overall market.\n\nChi said that his company has the ability to produce between 500,000 and 1 million units this year. The investment should allow for production of 2 million devices next year. The company expects to generate $100 million to $150 million in revenue this year and between $200 million and $300 million in 2025, according to Chi, who said he wants Xreal to go public in the US within two years.\n\nThe 7-year-old business now has about 600 employees and is based in Beijing. The company’s Air glasses present notifications, games and video in a wearer’s field of view. Chi said that Xreal’s products have made gains on more costly technology from Magic Leap Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which sells a headset called the HoloLens.\n\nStory continues\n\n“2023 was a very good year, and the market size pretty much doubled,” Chi said. The company, which said it gets the majority of its sales from Amazon.com Inc.’s website, offers AR glasses for as little as a few hundred dollars. But it believes its latest pair — the Air 2 Ultra — is what will drive future revenue.\n\n“There’s a good chance we can do 50,000 units of Ultra this year,” Chi said, adding that the cheaper models are “definitely easier to sell” and that mass consumers aren’t seeking as many bells and whistles as what they might get on rival products.\n\nXreal doesn’t have plans to get into virtual reality — a more immersive technology that’s used in Apple’s new Vision Pro — but Chi believes his company will compete with the iPhone maker in the years to come.\n\n“I think we’re three to five years ahead of them in AR,” Chi said. “They are catching up, though. So we need to keep up and push the boundary.”\n\nDuring development of the Vision Pro, Apple also worked on lightweight AR-only glasses similar to what Xreal offers. The company paused work on that device because it didn’t think the technology was ready yet, Bloomberg News reported last year. Meta and Google have said they’re planning their own consumer AR glasses for release in the coming years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because Alphabet is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for GOOGL in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.64 per share for GOOGL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for GOOGL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.26% heading into earnings season.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that GOOGL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Alphabet, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 47% of His Portfolio Invested in 5 Superb Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper runs Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993, and has long been one of the brightest stars on Wall Street. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,\" by Forbes. Tepper has \"consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa's] inception,\" according to Tepper's bio posted by Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nOver the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by 15%, no small feat, given the macroeconomic backdrop. His strong track record suggests that Tepper's stock picks might be worth further review. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors might be surprised to discover that, to close out the third quarter, Tepper had a whopping 47.1% of Appaloosa's portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 11.6% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 10.2% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 9.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 8.8% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 7.2%\n\nLet's take a look at Tepper's five top picks to see why he's so heavily weighted toward these AI stocks.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms might seem a surprising choice, but the company has a long history of using AI to bolster its business. The vast majority of Meta's revenue comes from digital advertising, and AI can more accurately surface relevant ads and other content on its social media sites.\n\nAs the world's second-largest digital advertiser, the recent rebound in ad spending has bolstered the company's fortunes. Meta has also released several AI-powered tools to help advertisers more accurately connect with their target market. Perhaps as importantly, the company developed a leading open-source AI model -- Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud infrastructure platforms, resulting in an entirely new revenue stream for the company.\n\nAt just 20 times forward earnings, Meta is selling at a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Tepper's investing decision.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft saw the writing on the wall and invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the past few years, helping spotlight the potential for generative AI. Its big tech rivals quickly follow suit, kicking demand for AI into overdrive. The tech giant answered the growing demand by infusing AI functionality across a broad swath of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. Furthermore, all the most popular AI models are available on Azure Cloud.\n\nThe biggest coup, however, was the debut of Microsoft Copilot, its AI assistant. Its ability to increase user productivity has generated strong demand and could produce incremental revenue of up to $100 billion by 2027, according to analyst calculations. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the third quarter, and Microsoft pointed out that three percentage points of that growth was the result of growing demand for AI.\n\nMicrosoft is currently trading for 31 times forward earnings. While that's a slight premium to the market, the company's strong legacy businesses and the opportunity afforded by AI make Microsoft a bargain at this price, which likely didn't escape Tepper's notice.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nWhile some viewed Amazon as slow out of the gate, it has jumped into the AI opportunity with both feet. The company has long used AI to handle product recommendations, inventory levels, delivery routes, and more.\n\nYet that's just the beginning of Amazon's AI opportunity. The company is now using generative AI to improve product listings, generate review summaries, and refine advertising. It also is working on an AI-powered tool that can answer questions about specific products.\n\nThere's more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a growing list of popular generative AI models, including a few of its own via its Bedrock AI. The company has also unveiled several AI-centric chips, including Inferentia and Trainium, designed to speed AI processing for AWS customers.\n\nDespite its strong recovery last year, Amazon is still selling for just 2 times forward sales, the standard for an underpriced stock, which likely piqued Tepper's interest.\n\n4. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion about AI stocks would be complete without a nod to Nvidia, a point highlighted by Tepper's position. Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized gaming and are the gold standard for AI applications.\n\nNvidia's processors have cornered the market in both data centers and machine learning, with an estimated 95% share in each. Experience in the field helped Nvidia quickly pivot to address the growing demand for generative AI.\n\nCompetitors are scrambling to develop competing processors, but Nvidia continues to maintain its edge. For the nine months ended Oct. 29, 2023, Nvidia spent $6.2 billion, or 16% of its total revenue, on research and development. The company's track record of continuing innovation will make it difficult to supplant.\n\nDespite the stock's recent run, Nvidia is still remarkably cheap, sporting a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- that benchmark for an undervalued stock -- of which Tepper was no doubt keenly aware.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Alphabet makes the lion's share of its revenue from digital advertising, in this case fueled by Google Search. The company has an impressive track record of deploying AI to improve its search algorithms and ad targeting, and the recovering ad market will no doubt improve the company's results.\n\nAlphabet didn't sleep on the potential of generative AI. The company integrated AI functionality into many of its flagship Google and Android products. As one of the Big Three cloud providers, it was able to expand the number of AI systems available to its Google Cloud customers.\n\nIts most recent offering, Gemini AI, is being hailed by the company as its \"largest and most capable AI model,\" outperforming rivals using a variety of widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, Alphabet's Vertex AI provides access to 130 foundational AI models with something for just about every use case.\n\nThe company's rebound over the past year notwithstanding, Alphabet still sells for just 19 times forward earnings, a valuation that Tepper likely couldn't pass up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Ackman Has Just 7 Stocks in His Portfolio. Are Any of Them Right for You?",
        "content": "Bill Ackman is one of the best-known hedge fund managers around.\n\nThe billionaire manager of Pershing Square Capital Management is an active poster on X (formerly Twitter) and he makes media appearances more than most of his hedge fund manager peers. He's been in the news for his activism at Harvard, but he's best known for his investments. In fact, at one time in his career, he was even dubbed \"Baby Buffett.\"\n\nAckman has made a number of high-profile investment bets, including shorting Herbalife, which failed, but he also made billions betting that the S&P 500 would fall as the coronavirus pandemic hit.\n\nToday, Pershing Square has $10.5 billion invested in just seven stocks. Let's take a look at each of the stocks in the portfolio, what they say about Ackman's investing style, and whether they are worth buying today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is now Ackman's biggest holding, making up 16.7% of the Pershing Square portfolio, across both classes of the stock. It's the newest holding in Pershing Square's portfolio as it was added in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAckman has explained that he sees the data the company generates from search and related products as giving it a competitive advantage in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). So far, the bet has paid off as Alphabet has outperformed the S&P 500, and the company also brushed off concerns (so far) that search would be disrupted by chatbots like ChatGPT.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG), the popular fast-casual Tex-Mex restaurant chain, is Ackman's second-biggest holding. Pershing Square has held the stock since the third quarter of 2016, making it its third-longest-held stock. Ackman currently owns $1.75 billion worth of Chipotle, and that investment has paid off handsomely as the stock is up 451% since Sept. 30, 2016.\n\nAt the time of the initial purchase, Chipotle was still struggling with the fallout from its E. coli outbreak in 2015, making the move something of a contrarian bet. Ackman said he believed Chipotle was fixable, and he helped install Brian Niccol as CEO of the chain, who is credited with driving the turnaround.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Howard Hughes\n\nAckman's third-biggest holding is Howard Hughes (NYSE: HHH), a diversified real estate holding company whose properties include multifamily residential, hospitality, and seaports. He's also chairman of the company.\n\nHoward Hughes is Ackman's longest-held stock; he owned it as early as the fourth quarter of 2010, as a result of its spinoff from General Growth Properties. He's hiked his stake in the company recently. Currently, Pershing Square owns $1.57 billion of Howard Hughes, and it makes up 14.5% of the fund's portfolio. Since the company was spun off from General Growth, it's up 114%, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\n4. Restaurant Brands International\n\nRestaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR) is another top holding of Ackman's, making up 14.4% of his portfolio. Between this investment and Chipotle, over 30% of Pershing Square's money is in restaurant stocks.\n\nRestaurant Brands International is the owner of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, and Ackman helped engineer the merger that combined Tim Hortons and Burger King. The company bought Popeyes later. Restaurant Brands International has underperformed the S&P 500 slightly since it started trading in 2014.\n\n5. Hilton Worldwide\n\nAnother consumer stock is No. 5 on Ackman's list. That's Hilton Worldwide (NYSE: HLT), one of the largest hotel operators in the world, which makes up 14.3% of the Pershing Square portfolio. Ackman started buying the stock in the fourth quarter of 2018 and bought nearly 1 million more shares in the third quarter. Like the other consumer stocks on this list, Ackman seems to like it because it's a simple, predictable business that generates cash and has pricing power.\n\nHilton has outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2018, gaining 161% versus the S&P's gain of 94%.\n\n6. Lowe's\n\nHome improvement retailer Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) also fits into Ackman's approach to consumer stocks as it operates in a duopoly with Home Depot. As of the end of the third quarter, Pershing Square owns $1.47 billion of Lowe's stock, making up 13.6% of the portfolio.\n\nPershing Square started buying Lowe's in the second quarter of 2018, and Lowe's stock has increased 120% since then compared to a 79% return for the S&P 500.\n\nPart of Ackman's thesis is that Lowe's should be able to narrow its gap with Home Depot, and Lowe's has outperformed Home Depot since his initial purchase as well.\n\n7. Canadian Pacific Kansas City\n\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE: CP), a railroad, is the last stock in Ackman's portfolio, and it's unique on the list as the only representative from the industrial sector. Pershing Square first bought CPKC in the fourth quarter of 2021, and it now makes up 10.4% of its portfolio. Canadian Pacific avoided the bear market and has narrowly beaten the S&P 500 since the end of 2021.\n\nAckman had owned CPKC shares back in the 2010s, and he said it was a mistake that Pershing Square sold the stock the first time around. Like other railroad stocks, Canadian Pacific enjoys wide operating margins.\n\nThree stocks for your buy list\n\nMost of these stocks have outperformed the market while Ackman has owned them, but three stocks in his portfolio stand out from the rest. Those are Alphabet, Chipotle, and Canadian Pacific, each of which has a strong competitive advantage.\n\nAlphabet's products like search and YouTube essentially have monopolies in their respective industries and generate bumper profits.\n\nChipotle has dominated fast-casual dining for nearly a generation, and it's learned to excel at the digital channel, giving it a superior profit margin and a brighter growth opportunity.\n\nCanadian Pacific generates operating margins in the 40% range and is the only transnational railroad linking Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, following its acquisition of Kansas City Southern.\n\nIf you're looking to follow Ackman's lead, starting with one of those three stocks makes the most sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn't one of them.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - European telecommunications lobbying group ETNO on Monday again urged Big Tech to help pay for the rollout of 5G and broadband as it released data showing Europe trails the United States and Asia in 5G networks, cloud computing, investments and revenues.\n\nThe comments by ETNO, whose members include Deutsche Telekom , Orange, Telefonica and Telecom Italia, come as the European Commission readies a proposal on digital networks and infrastructure on Feb. 21.\n\nThe EU telecoms industry's hopes of getting Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Netflix, Meta Platforms and Microsoft to help pay for the rollout of 5G and broadband were dashed last year after the Commission decided not to propose legislation to this effect but to leave it to the next team in 2025.\n\nDespite a record 59.1 billion euros ($64 billion) in investments by the sector last year, only 10 out of 114 networks in Europe were 5G standalone, ETNO said, citing a report it commissioned from research group Analysys Mason.\n\nOn edge cloud, which brings computing capacity close to the end user, Europe only had four commercialised offers in 2023 versus 17 offers in the Asia-Pacific region and nine in North America, it said.\n\nThe report said this was due to the fact that Europe's telecom capital expenditure per capita and average revenue per user (ARPU) in 2022 lagged that of South Korea, the United States and Japan.\n\nThe study reminded EU regulators of the Rights and Principles Declaration from 2022 which says that all market actors benefiting from the digital economy should make a 'fair and proportionate contribution' to digital network investment.\n\n\"The debate will shape the longer-term strength of the European telecoms sector, as well as its overall investment capacity,\" the report said.\n\n\"The status quo - both in terms of investment and of policy - will not deliver the levels of innovation that are so desperately needed to sustain growth and deliver on the Open Strategic Autonomy,\" ETNO Director General Lise Fuhr said.\n\n($1 = 0.9229 euros) (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

        "title": "2 Top AI Stocks With Up to 76% Upside in 2024, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "The markets have continued the strong rally so far in 2024. The Nasdaq Composite is closing in on a new all-time high, while the S&P 500 is already there after rising 22% over the last 12 months.\n\nIn such a bullish year for the markets, the one opportunity that everyone is talking about is artificial intelligence (AI) and which companies are likely to benefit over the next decade. This was a key theme driving shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) higher in 2023, and two Wall Street pros see even more upside.\n\nHere's why analysts remain bullish on these two tech stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia: 76% upside\n\nNvidia is the lead supplier of chips needed for AI training, and the business has been growing like there's no tomorrow. But even after the stock's monster run last year, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann sees shares of Nvidia reaching $1,100 in the next 12 to 18 months. That is 76% higher than the current share price of $625.\n\nNvidia has long dominated the market for graphics processing units (GPUs) and is estimated to control up to 95% of the market for AI chips. GPUs have become the gold standard for training AI models and running massive supercomputers and data centers. They are fundamentally faster and operate with better energy efficiency than central processing units (CPUs).\n\nThe stock is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50 based on Wall Street's earnings estimate for the fiscal year ending in January, but that could be a lot cheaper by next year. Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings per share to increase by another 67% over the next year. That would bring Nvidia's P/E down to 30.\n\nNvidia's growth so far has been mostly fueled by the consumer internet giants and cloud service providers, but CEO Jensen Huang sees another wave of demand on the way.\n\nIn the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings report, Huang said, \"Nations and regional [cloud service providers] are investing in AI clouds to serve local demand, enterprise software companies are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms, and enterprises are creating custom AI to automate the world's largest industries.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, the AI opportunity has years to play out, as it will take time for every industry to discover ways to use AI, not to mention time for data centers to upgrade their hardware systems to handle the tremendous data workloads.\n\nI believe the stock can move higher this year, but regardless of how it performs in the near term, investors should expect Nvidia's stock price to be a lot higher in 10 years than it is today.\n\n2. Alphabet: 21% upside\n\nAnother top AI stock that Wall Street is bullish about is Google owner Alphabet. The stock returned 58% in 2023, outperforming the Nasdaq's 43% gain on the year, but Barclays analyst Ross Sandler sees the stock reaching $180 in the next 12 to 18 months, or 21% higher than the current share price of $149.\n\nThe rapid adoption of AI plays right into the hands of Google, one of the biggest investors in AI technology. It helps companies manage and run their ad campaigns on Google Search and YouTube, which gets to the heart of why investors are optimistic about the company's prospects. Advertising drives three-quarters of Alphabet's total revenue.\n\nThe company recently introduced a new AI-driven feature called Circle to Search that enables users to find information about an object in an image or video by simply highlighting it. It's a good example of how AI will grow the value of Alphabet's advertising business.\n\nSearch already brings in $44 billion in quarterly revenue for the company, and it grew 11% year over year in the 2023 third quarter, primarily driven by retail ad spending. New AI-driven search tools could lead to higher user engagement, more search queries, and more shoppable ads.\n\nThe stock trades at a forward P/E of 22.

        "content": "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai will present Google results on Tuesday. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)\n\nAlphabet-owned Google has unleashed a wave of spending on AI start-ups and internal research and development as it rushes to integrate the technology into their products. Investors are waiting to see if the race against time and Microsoft (MSFT) has paid off as Google is scheduled to post fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.60, indicating 52.4% growth from the previous year’s reported figure.\n\nAlphabet's revenue is expected to be $85.24bn (£67bn), up from $76.05bn in the fourth quarter of 2022. Analysts anticipate net income to be $20.28bn, up from $13.62bn in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nRead more: What to expect from the Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia\n\n“On the artificial intelligence front, demand will likely drive growth in Google’s cloud business. We believe reduced economic uncertainty, combined with the necessity of AI to operate more efficiently, will bring in more cloud clients and increase client usage,” Ali Moghrabi, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said.\n\nEvergrande (3333.HK)\n\nShares in the Chinese property developer plunged 20% before a court in Hong Kong ordered its liquidation.\n\nOnce China’s biggest developer, Evergrande has reported more than $300bn in liabilities, earning the title of the world’s most indebted property developer.\n\nJudge Linda Chan said \"enough is enough\" after the troubled developer repeatedly failed to come up with a plan to restructure its debts.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite the ruling, analysts are sceptical any of them will get repaid in full. Some 90% of its assets are in the mainland, according to the Hong Kong court judgment on Monday, meaning Beijing could choose to shrug off the court order.\n\n\"I doubt (Evergrande's) offshore creditors would receive substantial recovery proceeds from the liquidation order,\" Zerlina Zeng, a credit analyst at Creditsights Singapore LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe landmark ruling could send ripples across the country’s financial system at a time when authorities are trying to curb a stock market sell-off.\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nRyanair revealed sharply falling profits following a surge in fuel costs and cut its full-year profit outlook after being removed from some online travel agent websites.\n\nThe budget carrier reported after-tax profits slumping to €15m (£12.8m) for its third quarter to the end of December, from €211m (£180m) a year earlier.\n\nThe Irish airline said the group’s fuel bill surged by 35% to €1.2bn (£1bn), which outweighed a 17% rise in revenues.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets calm after court orders Evergrande liquidation\n\nRyanair has told Boeing (BA) that if any US customers refuse to take delivery of 737 MAX 10 aircraft, that it would buy them “at the right price”. Boeing has been mired in regulatory and safety concerns following the Alaska Airlines incident where a fuselage plug blew off an aircraft earilier in January.\n\nRyanair, Europe’s largest by passenger numbers, already has 150 firm orders for the MAX 10, the largest jet in the 737 family, and options for 150 more, with the first deliveries due in 2027.\n\nNatWest (NWG.L)\n\nThe UK government could kick off a sale of NatWest shares to the public as early as the middle of this year, once a permanent chief executive has been installed at the bank, according to reports.\n\nThe multibillion-pound public sale of shares in the high street lender could take place as soon as June, The Times said. Shares are expected to be priced at a discount to make them more appealing to retail investors.\n\nA contract to a market research company has been awarded to study the public's views, alongside a tender to public relations firms and advertising companies who would work on the marketing campaign.\n\nNatWest remains 36% owned by the government after it was rescued during the financial crisis.\n\nWatch: China property giant Evergrande told to liquidate</p><p>A Hong Kong court gave the order Monday morning. </p><p>It comes after the world’s most indebted developer was crushed by more than $300 billion in liabilities. </p><p>The firm defaulted on its debts back in 2021, throwing the country’s whole property market into turmoil. </p><p>Now the liquidation order is likely to deepen the crisis in the sector, and jolt China’s fragile capital markets. </p><p>Beijing was already grappling with an underperforming economy and stocks wallowing near five-year lows. </p><p>Now any new hit to markets could undermine revival efforts, and ramp up demands for more stimulus measures. </p><p>Evergrande had been working on a $23 billion debt revamp plan with bondholders. </p><p>But those efforts were scuppered last September when billionaire founder Hui Ka Yan was put under investigation for suspected crimes. </p><p>A liquidation petition was first filed back in June 2022, but the proceedings were adjourned multiple times as Evergrande scrambled for a survival plan. </p><p>At least three other developers have already been ordered to liquidate by Hong Kong courts. \",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4NBUjhaWtz0JV_BeW_ySKw--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/37766985866f612e6c0613e6555dae99\",\"duration\":\"PT1M20S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/d2b36be1-9426-3664-8ab8-4aab1d9b8fbb.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/china-property-giant-evergrande-told-054122626.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"d2b36be1-9426-3664-8ab8-4aab1d9b8fbb\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Data centres improved greatly in energy efficiency as they grew massively larger",
        "content": "As you step into one of 42 data halls on a plot of 74,000 square metres near Sydney, Australia, you become immersed in a sterile science-fiction world. Towering rows of black server cabinets stand in meticulous order, containing thousands of whirring hard drives, the beating metal hearts of a massive “hyperscale” data centre. Overhead, fibre-optic cables carry data down into each cabinet; metal wires, electricity. Outside a substation delivers power; batteries and generators provide backup. The digital world pulses unceasingly on an uninterrupted flow of electricity.\n\nIn 2022 data centres used between 240 and 500 terawatt-hours of electricity, roughly 1-2% of that consumed worldwide, up from 0.5% in 2000. At the low end of estimates that is more than Australia used as a country; at the high end, more than France, the 10th-biggest consumer of electricity.\n\nGrowing demand for digital experiences means more and bigger data centres. Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft used 72 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2021, more than double their usage in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). By 2022 these four companies accounted for nearly 80% of global hyperscale data-centre capacity. A fair chunk of the rest is in China. Several hyperscale data centres are under construction in the remote northern city of Hohhot in the region of Inner Mongolia, on tracts as large as 140 football pitches. Huawei, a Chinese tech giant and cloud provider, is among the operators, along with major state-owned companies China Telecom and China Mobile.\n\nOutside China, the pace of data-centre construction has been taxing resources to the point that some governments have felt compelled to slow it down. In 2019 Singapore temporarily halted the construction of new data centres, concerned that building more might make it difficult to fulfil its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. (It began issuing permits again in 2023, allocating power for several new data centres including for ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.) In Ireland EirGrid, the national utility, has stopped issuing connections to new data centres until 2028 out of concern for running out of grid-connected energy capacity; data centres already account for 18% of electricity consumption there. (Microsoft may get around this issue by using a stand-alone gas plant to power a data centre in Dublin.)\n\nStory continues\n\nIn northern Virginia, Dominion, a utility company, paused new power connections to data centres for several months in 2022 to, as the company put it, “make sure that the integrity of our system can support this growth”. Sometimes referred to as data-centre alley, northern Virginia is home to just over three square kilometres of data centres, most of which are within 75 square kilometres in Loudoun County. Delivering a lot of electricity to a small area is logistically tricky. And demand is set to grow by about 85% over the next 15 years, Dominion says.\n\nPauses like these have not stopped data-centre growth, but rather shifted it elsewhere. More data centres are popping up in secondary markets that have fewer resource constraints, like Maryland and Malaysia. As data-centre activity grows in these areas, those governments may have to step in to protect their grids.\n\nDespite all this the internet’s use of electricity has been notably efficient. According to the IEA, between 2015 and 2022 the number of internet users increased by 78%, global internet traffic by 600% and data-centre workloads by 340%. But energy consumed by those data centres rose by only 20-70%.\n\nSuch improved efficiency comes partly from improved thriftiness in computation. For decades the energy required to do the same amount of computation has fallen by half every two-and-a-half years, a trend known as Koomey’s law. And efficiencies have come from data centres as they have grown in size, with increasingly greater shares of their energy use going to computation.\n\nThirst traps\n\nUnfortunately, some efficiencies of scale have come at the expense of another important resource: water. By the 2000s, as data centres evolved into tightly clustered racks of increasingly powerful servers, they began to require industrial-strength air-conditioning systems to cool the servers as they got hot from processing data. These systems require massive amounts of water to cool the air that cools the servers. In particularly hot places like Singapore, data centres’ thirst for water is even greater.\n\nAs chips get increasingly powerful, they run hotter too—packing more transistors into a smaller area means you can move electrons around more quickly, generating more heat. This makes chips more efficient per unit of computation, but requires more cooling per chip. In 2022 Google and Microsoft consumed 32bn litres of water, mostly in their data centres, the same as about 700,000 people in a rich country. (It is generally cheaper and more energy-efficient to throw away old water than to clean it and recycle it through cooling ponds.)\n\nThe world has been fortunate that the tech giants are concerned about the resources they use up, and are investing heavily in renewable energy (or that they have decided appearing concerned aligns with their long-term financial interests). Tech companies are by far the biggest buyers of green energy by means of power-purchase agreements (PPAs). These are long-term contracts between a buyer (like a data-centre company) and a power producer (like a solar- or wind-farm operator) to buy electricity at a predetermined price, instead of bulk-buying from utilities. PPAs provide a level of financial security, making it easier for renewable projects to get built. The data-centre industry has collectively added (or will add) 74 gigawatts of capacity in this way.\n\nTech companies also buy large quantities of renewable-energy certificates (RECs), which are a way of financing the creation of renewable capacity. A power company is issued RECs for electricity that is generated and delivered to the grid from a renewable-energy resource. They are then free to sell RECs as they wish. Tech giants using RECs can claim data centres as carbon-free when the actual electricity they are using to power the data centres is not.\n\nThe nuclear option\n\nData-centre giants have also invested more directly in unproven energy technologies, making bets before it might otherwise have seemed financially sensible. In the late 2000s Google invested in over two gigawatts of early solar and wind projects to help scale the technology to drive down costs.\n\nSuch investments are vital because renewable energy and data centres are far from a perfect match. A data centre is expected to be running 99.982% of the time, so it needs a steady and certain stream of power. Much of renewable energy is variable, dependent on the sun shining and the wind blowing. Running completely on clean energy will require other technologies to fill the gaps.\n\nNuclear technologies, like fusion or small modular reactors, could produce stable, limitless energy for data centres. They are not commercially available yet, but again data-centre companies are funding them. In 2023 Microsoft signed a PPA to buy fusion power from Helion Energy, a startup, by 2028. Tapping into geothermal energy is another possibility. Google first invested in the concept in 2008; in November the firm (along with Fervo, a startup) finished building a small, 3.5-megawatt geothermal plant in the Nevada desert. These technologies cannot yet compete at a commercial scale, but the same was true of wind and solar 15 years ago.\n\nA big need right now is long-term storage, literally saving energy for a rainy day. Currently when a grid fails, a data centre will run on batteries for a few minutes until methane-fuelled generators kick in. Google, Microsoft and the like are investing in alternative storage technologies. Hydrogen, for example, can pack a lot of energy into a small space, and in theory could power a data centre for days instead of minutes. And data centres can alleviate the problem of variable load that afflicts renewables-based grids. In a practice called “load shifting”, data-centre operators move certain tasks that are not time-sensitive, like training an AI model, to different times or even to different data centres. Google has created a system that can shift computation jobs to when and where grids are cleanest.\n\nTech firms are also playing a leading role in another emerging climate-friendly technology, durable carbon-dioxide removal (CDR). This involves taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it somewhere in a safe way that keeps it from ever getting back there. In 2020 Microsoft declared its intention to use the technology to help reach its goal of going “carbon negative”.\n\nSuch innovations help explain why the tech giants are making big promises about their environmental sustainability. Google and Equinix, another operator of hyperscale data centres, say they will run completely on carbon-free energy by 2030. Microsoft has committed to becoming carbon-negative and water-positive by 2030—that is, using offsets like durable CDR and cleaning dirty water. Microsoft says it will remove the equivalent of all the carbon the company has ever emitted by 2050 (when asked how the gas plant in Dublin fitted into these plans, Microsoft said its intention had been to use gas as a backup power source, and that the company remains committed to powering data centres “in the most carbon-friendly way possible”). Amazon’s goal is to reach net-zero carbon by 2040, running its data centres on 100% renewable energy by 2025 (as with the other companies, only when including RECs). Apple has committed to being 100% carbon-neutral by 2030 across its data centres and supply chains, through a combination of reducing emissions by 75% and investing in carbon removal. Meta says it will be net zero by 2030.\n\nThe tech giants will deserve plaudits if they can meet these goals. All the more so because the internet might be crossing an inflection point in electricity use after which it will grow even more quickly than it has to date. One factor in this surge in energy demand to come is edge computing. Bringing more computing power closer to the user means a lot more (smaller, less efficient) data centres. Several consultancies project, perhaps boosterishly, that the edge data-centre market will more than triple in value globally by the end of the decade, to about $30bn-40bn.\n\nAnother big factor is AI’s ravenous appetite for energy. AI requires a lot more calculations than regular computing. A rack of normal servers might run on 7 kilowatts of electricity; for AI racks it can be 30-100 kilowatts. The reason for this discrepancy is that AI uses much more powerful hardware than is needed for, say, storing photos or maintaining websites. Because AI is based on matrix maths, it involves large blocks of computation being done at once, which means a lot of transistors have to change states very quickly. That draws a lot more power than normal computer tasks, which flip far fewer transistors at once for a typical calculation.\n\nIt is no coincidence that many advanced AI firms are data-centre giants\n\nThis adds up fast. A large language model may be trained for weeks on tens of thousands of power-hungry special AI servers. And as models get more advanced they consume more resources. One estimate suggests that it cost OpenAI more than 50 gigawatt-hours of electricity to train GPT-4 (or 0.02% of the amount of electricity California generates in a year). That is more than 50 times more electricity than training its predecessor, GPT-3, required.\n\nAn insatiable hunger for power\n\nThe energy costs of actually using AI models will dwarf training costs, according to Nvidia, maker of the most popular AI chip. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside, found that GPT-3 consumes roughly a litre of water to generate 40-100 responses; GPT-4 probably consumes even more.\n\nThe tech giants are investing heavily in AI. It is no coincidence that many of the most advanced AI firms are big data-centre companies, or are partners with one. The future of AI, who will get ahead and who will lag behind, depends greatly on who can build out the necessary physical infrastructure to support it. Microsoft—a cloud provider, a major player in AI research and an investor in OpenAI—plans to spend more than $50bn per year on cloud infrastructure from 2024. Meta estimates that it will spend more than $30bn on data centres in 2024. CoreWeave, a startup which provides cloud infrastructure for AI companies, grew in 2023 from three to 14 data centres in North America.\n\nThis scale of construction portends a serious ramp-up in electricity consumption (see chart). A recent analysis in Joule, an energy journal, suggests that at the rate they are being produced, AI servers could use about 100 terawatt-hours of electricity each year by 2027, between a quarter and a fifth of total data-centre consumption. Schneider Electric, a French firm that builds power supplies for data centres, projects that AI’s share of data-centre electricity use will jump from 8% in 2023 to 15-20% in 2028.\n\nFurther gains in efficiency would help. Data centres may well achieve some through how they manage another challenge presented by AI chips: keeping them cool. Because they use up so much power, AI chips overheat more easily than normal ones and need special cooling technologies. One solution is to use liquid rather than air as a coolant, by circulating a fluid through a cold plate that is fixed directly to the chip. The heat from the chip goes directly into the coolant, which then flows through pipes to be cooled again. One study found that liquid cooling reduced the total power consumption of a data centre by just over 10%.\n\nSuch efficiencies will be helpful, but still amount to drops in the ocean compared with future energy demand created by the internet. No matter how efficient they get, you cannot stop data centres from needing power, because servers need power. Ultimately for data centres to become carbon-free, the electricity grids that power them will need to become carbon-free. Governments and the tech giants will have to work together towards that goal, but it will be a tall order. The geopolitics of climate change are not dissimilar to the geopolitics of the internet: convoluted and messy.\n\n© 2024 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

        "content": "On June 7th 2022 Asia-Africa-Europe-1, a fibre-optic cable which connects Europe and Asia, was cut where it crosses land in Egypt. Somalia and Ethiopia lost 85% of their connectivity for several hours; the cloud services of Amazon, Google and Microsoft were all briefly disrupted, increasing latency for much international traffic; LinkedIn went down. And that was just one cable, on land, where the repair job was simple. Were all of the subsea cables to be severed at, say, the entrance to the Red Sea between Yemen and Djibouti, financial transactions would stutter. Zoom calls between London and Singapore would lag and glitch. Connectivity would persist—packets would be rerouted through America, or through space via satellites—but not without major slowdowns.\n\nThe submarine-cable system carries 99% of intercontinental internet traffic. A subsea fibre-optic cable gets cut every three days or so, according to TeleGeography, a consultancy, often because of fishing or an anchor dragging across the ocean floor. Yet the digital world rarely misses a trick for two very physical reasons. The first is that with 552 (active and planned) subsea cables spanning 1.4m kilometres, there is enough redundancy in most places to make up for cable failures (see map). The second reason is that a fleet of 60 repair ships around the world are on stand-by to fix broken cables.\n\nFibre-optic cables run along various routes around the world, giving the internet options for directing traffic. In most cases if one path fails, packets of data will find their way around without users being the wiser. That is part of the beauty of abstraction. But in the Red Sea and Egypt, abstraction has masked a physical bottleneck. Just about all information sent from Asia to Europe flows through 11 fibre-optic cables at the bottom of the Red Sea, then mostly through Egypt via land cables controlled by one company, Telecom Egypt, before reaching the Mediterranean. If something disastrous were to happen to this route, people would notice.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch a digital choke-point might seem alarming given that the Suez Canal has been a vulnerable physical choke-point, as shown by the badly parked Ever Given container ship in 2021, or by the recent attacks on shipping by the Houthis. In many ways, though, the physical shape of the internet—where wires are laid, where they stop, who is connected with whom—is dictated by geography, politics and inertia. It is sensible to lay tracks where others have put them before. The British Empire opened the Red Sea route in 1870, when it laid telegraph cables to connect with its colonies. Telegraph was replaced by co-axial cable, then by fibre-optic.\n\nWhenever a subsea cable is broken somewhere in the world, a repair ship will be dispatched. A pulse of light may be sent down the line to help pinpoint a rupture in a cable that is a few centimetres thick. The repair ship then uses sonar and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to find the break and haul the ends of the cable onboard. There humans will splice on a new section of fibre with precision. It is like trying to align three pieces of hair. Then the cable is lowered and reburied (often by an ROV) at the bottom of the ocean. In most cases users have no idea a cable was broken. Repair jobs generally take just a few days or a week, during which time internet packets automatically get re-routed anyway.\n\nBut where there is a choke-point, especially in a remote spot, a cable break can be locally catastrophic. When the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in 2022, underwater mudslides severed the Tonga Cable, leaving Tongans without reliable internet for five weeks, until a repair ship could be wrangled. Many islands in the South Pacific have only one fibre connection, if any. Where there is no redundancy, there is vulnerability.\n\nBuilding routes other than through the Suez Canal would be wise. But it is not easy. In the 2000s a cable was proposed that link Jeddah and Istanbul, connecting by way of Amman and Damascus. Just after it launched, it was reportedly blown up during the civil war in Syria and never repaired. In 2021 Google started work on a new overland route through Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia; now that project appears to be on hold.\n\nAdding more connections will also help the one in three people globally who do not have or cannot afford the internet. Many African countries lack sufficient data centres to store information, or internet exchanges to route traffic. As a consequence many packets of data must make a slow intercontinental trip. Long-distance land cables help, but they are hard to lay and maintain across rugged terrain. As more infrastructure gets built this problem will ease. In 2024 a route called 2Africa, which extends from Britain around the continent to India, will speed up service for many. Satellites help too, but users need subsidies.\n\nLaying fibre-optic cables is expensive. In the past, telecoms companies like AT&T formed consortiums to pay for the task. Now cloud companies like Google and Meta do so. Their hyperscale data centres need massive amounts of connectivity to keep clouds updated. They have come to want the “predictability” that ownership brings, says Frank Rey of Microsoft.\n\nGoogle funded its first transpacific cable in 2008. It has since invested in at least 25 more, 12 of which it owns fully. Meta has invested in 15, one of which it owns outright. Microsoft partly owns four. Alcatel Submarine Networks, one of three major submarine fibre-optic-cable manufacturers in the world, reckons that more than two-thirds of current projects are supported by big tech firms. There is more than a whiff of vertical integration to this trend. As the cable map diversifies physically, it is concentrating corporately.\n\nChina, perhaps a bit oddly, stands outside this trend. Chinese companies are currently not invested in new transpacific cables, and planned cable routes mostly steer clear of hot spots like the South China Sea. Operators prefer to limit the interplay of politics and connectivity and let data come and go; Chinese and American network operators use many of the same cables for internet traffic, and there are no signs yet of China’s role as a regional connection hub waning. But the question of who controls the physical connections of the internet—which few companies or indeed which countries—will become more urgent in times of real-world conflict. The centrality of the internet to modern life has made securing it an urgent necessity.\n\n© 2024 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.\n\nFrom The Economist, published under licence.

        "title": "The internet is integrated into virtually every aspect of life",
        "content": "The sheer amount of gold in Fort Knox was so great that Auric Goldfinger, the villain of the 1964 James Bond film which carries his name, knew he could not simply steal it: instead he planned to use a nuclear device to irradiate it, destroying its value and thus increasing that of his own reserves. Casing the facilities of equivalent strategic worth to the world today—the hyperscale data centres of Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft—suggests that something almost as dramatic would be needed to take them down. They are fortresses with layer after layer of protection, from fences to airlock-style entrances to biometric scanners.\n\nGood thing, too. Much of the planet relies on these cloud fortresses, and will do so even more in years to come. Remarkable as the cloud is, there is no reason to think it is anywhere near completion. The generation of data and the need for its analysis continue to grow, and both storage and analysis are increasingly cloud-based. Hospitals use it to access patient records and share test results. Governments use it for elections, services and disaster alerts. The global financial system—bank transfers, stock trades—increasingly relies on it.\n\nBecause of abstraction and the distributed nature of cloud computing, no single data centre holds all the world’s valuables. No single cable keeps the entire internet connected. No single hack will wipe out everyone’s savings or turn everyone’s lights off. But as the internet becomes integrated into virtually every aspect of life, keeping its infrastructure secure will be ever more essential. Spending on cybersecurity globally is expected to surpass $200bn in 2024. Physical security for cloud servers is a big part of that bill. So is protecting servers from hackers, including those already inside otherwise secure buildings. All Google employees have a physical piece of hardware that they must use to log on.\n\nGiven that the internet came out of the Pentagon—its earliest incarnation was an American military research project, ARPANET —it may seem surprising that security is not built into its roots. But the goal of ARPANET, a project which began two years after “Goldfinger” hit cinema screens, was to develop a packet-switching system that would link the computers of various military-funded research institutions and, later, to ensure a multiplicity of routes such that the system could survive a nuclear attack. It was not to keep the system’s data safe. And as ARPANET gave way to the purely academic world of the early internet, the idealistic graduate students who fostered its growth focused on creating an open and accessible network. It was not until the first browsers became commercially available in the mid-1990s that a protocol designed to encrypt data, authenticate servers and verify that data has not been tampered with was added to the internet. It was soon outdated and replaced; the same process continues today.\n\nStory continues\n\nBig is beautiful\n\nAs well as attempting to steal data, hackers can also try to paralyse the systems that distribute it. On October 10th 2023 Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft and CloudFlare, a CDN provider, all disclosed that they had been the targets of a colossal distributed denial of service (DDoS, pronounced “dee doss”) attack in August and September. Google reported receiving 398m requests for data each second during the two-minute-long attack, more than 4,000 times the rate at which search queries normally come in—and seven-and-a-half times larger than the previous record.\n\nThe fact that the services under attack weathered the storm is just one more of the forces pushing the internet towards a more integrated business model, with companies operating at every level from cable and server to application, and thus favouring its giants. It is that sort of scale which allows firms to withstand and respond to attacks as well as they do now.\n\nThis is just one of the ways in which, as the cloud grows, more and more of that growth will be seen in the companies that dominate it. The biggest tech firms are spending heavily to distribute computing power to the edge of the network, to push an evolution from electronics to photonics, and to buy the capacity to provide reliable renewable power. The physical business of moving and processing the data used by people, companies and governments increasingly operates on an ever grander scale. As the infrastructure allows computation to be ever better distributed, the companies behind the scenes will continue to get bigger and bigger.\n\nPerhaps, one day, that will stop. Perhaps, one day, the world will not need ever more computation to feed its appetite for services, for entertainment, for economic growth. In developed countries economic activity is increasingly decoupled from the use of energy; GDP can grow as energy use falls. It may be that, one day, the world will have all the computational power that it needs. But if that day ever dawns, it will not do so for decades to come. And until it does so, the abstracted world of human and artificial thought and communication will demand ever more investment and imagination from those who provide its underpinnings.\n\n© 2024 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

For Baidu, the Samsung deal marks a major adopter of its Ernie AI, one of the earliest and best efforts to create a Chinese challenger to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nSamsung’s market share has crumbled in the world’s largest smartphone arena in past years to roughly 1-2%, crowded out by Apple Inc.’s iPhones as well as local brands from Xiaomi Corp. to Huawei Technologies Co.

While positive for sentiment, we don’t expect a material financial benefit to Baidu given the collapse of Samsung’s once-leading market share in China handsets.

        "title": "What AI can't do at work",
        "content": "AI still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs — the human touch. (Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nArtificial intelligence is now a part of our everyday lives and many of us use and encounter AI without even thinking about it. We ask Alexa to play music or check a recipe, Siri organises our calendars and Facebook, Instagram and X use the technology to decide which social media posts — or adverts — to show us.\n\nThe development of accessible tools like ChatGPT has also led to the integration of AI in the workplace. AI’s ability to analyse huge amounts of data and recognise patterns allows it to imitate human function and to problem-solve, reason, learn, perceive and carry out day-to-day admin tasks. Understandably, this had led to concerns about its potential to surpass human capacity in certain areas.\n\nAI may be capable of creating images and text, hiring, predicting trends and making financial decisions, but it’s important to remember its limitations. While the tech will undoubtedly bring a whole host of support and capabilities to our workplaces, it is essential to understand that it won’t completely replace humans — at least not yet, anyway.\n\nRead more: How AI could help us move to a four-day work week\n\nIt still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs — the human touch.\n\nAI can't empathise\n\n“AI has been a great tool to assist with data analysis and automation, but it lacks the genuine empathy and practical common sense in various aspects of work and life,” says careers expert Deirdre Orr. “The ability to understand emotions, navigate complex social dynamics, and make nuanced decisions based on context and experience sets humans apart in ways that AI cannot fully emulate.”\n\nEmpathy, the ability to see another person’s perspective and appreciate their point of view, is a powerful tool. Research suggests that the genuine feeling and expression of empathy has far-reaching effects in our personal and professional lives, and has been linked to better physical health, the maintenance of cognitive function, happiness, resilience, resistance to burnout and better relationships.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has also been associated with professional success, putting pay to the idea of ‘looking after number one’. In a 14-year study from the University of California-Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, those who were generous and agreeable were more likely to be promoted to a position of power.\n\nEmpathy can also increase sales and investment opportunities too, as being empathic can help people better understand the motivation of clients, customers and investors.\n\nRead more: Should you use AI to write your cover letter?\n\n“Empathy and common sense are invaluable assets in the workplace, each offer very unique qualities that AI cannot replicate,” says Orr. “They enhance collaboration, reduce conflicts, and boost employee engagement. Furthermore, these qualities stimulate innovation, improve customer relations, and aid in sound decision-making.”\n\nEssentially, empathy softens negative emotions — something that AI can’t do. Of course, this is less important if all jobs were to become automated overnight, but research suggests this is unlikely to happen any time soon. In healthcare the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial. (PhonlamaiPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nAI in the workplace\n\nWhile the new technology is likely to disrupt our workplaces, it will do so by taking on our admin-heavy tasks instead of replacing us completely. In part, a recent MIT study found, this is because AI is too expensive.\n\nThere are jobs in which empathy is even more important. Artificial Intelligence has been making significant strides in healthcare, from diagnosis to treatment and research. It has been rightly hailed as a game-changer, but its lack of an ability to empathise is its achilles heel. In healthcare — and particularly mental healthcare — the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial.\n\nFor people in distress, human connection and meaningful relationships are key components of recovery — so much so that compassion is an irreplaceable part of a therapeutic relationship. Having an empathic connection with a doctor, nurse or therapist builds trust, which can encourage compliance with treatments and help patients cope with difficult diagnoses. This is something AI simply can’t replicate and even if we were to create tech that mimics empathy and compassion, it would raise serious ethical problems.\n\nRead more: Will AI make us even lonelier at work?\n\nAnd, Orr adds, there are other problems with relying too heavily on AI. “It is limited in the workplace when it comes to actual ethical decision making,” she explains. “Moral judgement comes from within a human, so when it's time to fully assess a situation and issue a complex decision it would be very difficult for AI to provide a response that is fair, ethical, and unbiased.”\n\nA good example is discrimination in recruitment. AI can scan job applications and vet applicants quickly and effectively, making what is notoriously a time-consuming process much more streamlined. But, the decisions made by AI are shaped by the initial data it receives. So if the underlying data is unfair, skewed or discriminatory, the resulting algorithms can perpetuate bias, potentially contributing to widespread inequality.\n\n“AI just can't replicate or navigate the complex nuances of various human aspects in the workplace,” says Orr. “Also, AI is very limited when it comes to customer service. It can understand most simple commands and requests, but AI bots truly struggle to offer employees, customers and clients the personalised touch that is needed to provide exemplary customer service.”\n\nWatch: Accenture CTO explains how AI will aid businesses, new jobs</p>\\n<p>Accenture (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACN?p=ACN\\\">ACN</a>) Chief Technology Officer Paul Daugherty joins Yahoo Finance for the latest installment of its <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/live/ai-revolution\\\"><em>AI Revolution special</em></a> to help discuss the data and the ways workplace AI may effectively be incorporated into many business models to benefit workers.</p>\\n<p>Daugherty explains that the advent of AI is like nothing before, and so businesses will need to revolutionize how they approach work: \\\"We believe what's happening, what needs to happen, is companies need to re-invent work itself and how it happens.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were subdued on Monday, with markets preparing for a busy week of major earnings and central bank policy announcements. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among many of the tech giants due to report results this week, while the Federal Reserve will unveil its latest policy decision and deliver closely-watched commentary that could help determine the path ahead for interest rates. China Evergrande (HK:3333) is ordered to liquidate, starting a new and possibly lengthy chapter for the heavily indebted property developer.\n\n1. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around both sides of the flatline on Monday, as traders geared up for a week of key corporate earnings and central bank decisions.\n\nBy 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 55 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 19 points or 0.1%.\n\nA solid start to the new year for the main averages on Wall Street will likely face a stern exam in the coming days. Investors will be parsing through numbers from some of America's largest businesses and digesting influential commentary from the Federal Reserve, both of which may help clarify the outlook for the broader economy (see below).\n\nThe S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% on Friday, leaving the benchmark index near all-time highs, a move that reflects market hopes that inflation may be cooling without a meltdown in growth -- a scenario commonly referred to as a \"soft landing.\" The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also fell by 0.4% to end the prior trading week, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%.\n\n2. Big-name earnings ahead\n\nA parade of high-profile and possibly market-moving results are due out from a string of companies this week, including many of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have powered a recent surge in equities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft will report after the bell, only days after the tech giant's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which like Microsoft has been a beneficiary of a wave of hype around artificial intelligence, will also unveil its latest numbers following the close of markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday will feature semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), with investors on the lookout for the San Diego-based group's view of the year ahead for chipmaking. Quarterly figures are also due from Boeing (NYSE:BA), the embattled planemaker who has come under fresh scrutiny following a dangerous mid-flight blowout on one of its 737 Max 9 models earlier this month, as well as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), the Danish drugmaker behind the popular weight loss medication Wegovy.\n\nMore megacap tech firms are set to step into the limelight on Thursday, including iPhone-maker Apple, e-commerce behemoth Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\n3. Fed decision in focus\n\nMarkets will also be keeping their eye on the Federal Reserve, as the world's most influential central bank holds its latest two-day policy meeting.\n\nFed officials are tipped to keep interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs following the gathering on Wednesday, placing extra focus on any comments regarding the outlook for borrowing costs in the near term.\n\nIn December, the Fed signaled that it could reduce rates six times this year, fueling hopes for a cut as early as March. But several policymakers have moved to temper these expectations, indicating that worries remain that a rapid loosening in financial conditions could reignite cooling inflationary pressures.\n\nA stronger-than-expected advance estimate of fourth-quarter U.S. growth last week also bolstered the case for the Fed to hold off on lowering rates any time soon. Meanwhile, economists expect January nonfarm payrolls on Friday to show ongoing resilience in the U.S. labor market -- although the Fed will not be able to factor this particular piece of data into its latest projections.\n\nHow the Fed sees price gains and economic activity evolving in 2024 will likely influence bets over the timing of the first cut. According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, there is an almost 50% chance the bank will roll it out in May.\n\n4. China Evergrande ordered to liquidate\n\nChina Evergrande has been ordered to be wound up by a Hong Kong court after the world's most indebted property developer failed to secure a restructuring agreement with its creditors.\n\nThe group, which has over $300 billion in total liabilities, has been attempting to secure the deal for more than two years in the wake of a bond repayment and a series of court hearings.\n\nBut Justice Linda Chan on Monday appointed management consultancy Alvarez&Marsal to liquidate Evergrande, arguing that the move will provide some certainty to creditors. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" Chan said in the morning court session, Reuters reported.\n\nEvergrande's Chief Executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media that the decision will not impact the operations of its onshore and offshore units. But analysts have flagged that the liquidation process could be complicated and lengthy, as well as damaging to already downbeat sentiment around the state of China's property market.\n\nShares in Evergrande slumped by just under 21% after the announcement.\n\n5. Crude volatile amid Middle East turmoil\n\nOil prices were choppy on Monday, as traders fretted over increased disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nBy 05:08 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.4% lower at $77.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $82.68 per barrel. Both contracts had risen earlier in the day.\n\nThe attack, which U.S. President Joe Biden said was carried out by Iran-backed militants, resulted in the death of three American service members. It was the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.\n\nIran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns over a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings, Fed this week; Evergrande ordered to liquidate - what's moving markets\n\nSlovakia looks to buy Patriot air defence system from United States\n\nChina's vice premier urges more support for listed firms amid market rout",

        "content": "Crypto Ads Could Start Appearing on Google After Tech Giant Revised Policy\n\nGoogle is set to update its ad policies on Monday, January 29, allowing certain cryptocurrency products to be advertised. This policy change could see advertisements for the recently-launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) appear on its search engines.\n\nHowever, Google's policy update refers to the allowed products as \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States,\" leaving some ambiguity. Notably, one of the largest Bitcoin trusts, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), recently converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF following the SEC's approval.\n\nPreviously, GBTC shares were only available to accredited investors on the primary market, subject to a six-month holding period. Accredited investors must meet specific financial criteria, such as having a net worth over $1 million or a high earned income.\n\nIn contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs are available to the general public in the United States and are regulated under the Securities Act of 1933. This makes them a potentially safer option for Google to consider in advertising. The policy update is seen as a positive development, especially given Google's vast reach and influence in driving awareness and inflows for the 10 spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. BlackRock’s IBIT currently leads with the largest AUM, which recently surpassed $2 billion.",

        "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a muted fashion Monday, at the start of an action-packed week full of event risk, including the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year.\n\nAt 03:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% lower, while the CAC 40 in France traded 0.1% higher and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. rose 0.1%.\n\nFed to meet on Wednesday\n\nInvestors have started the new week on a cautious note, with the main indices trading in tight ranges ahead of a potentially crucial policy-setting by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.\n\nThe U.S. is set to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.\n\nThe Bank of England also meets this week, and is also expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday, following on from the European Central Bank keeping interest rates unchanged at a record-high 4% last week.\n\nRyanair trims annual profit forecast\n\nIn the corporate sector, Ryanair (IR:RYA) stock fell 2.9% after the budget airline trimmed its profit forecast for the year to the end of March after some online travel agents stopped selling its flights in December, forcing it to cut fares to fill seats.\n\nPhilips (AS:PHG) stock fell 4.4% after the Dutch medical device maker reported another loss in 2023, even though the losses were trimmed compared with the previous year, as it seeks to bounce back from a series of damaging recalls.\n\nBayer (ETR:BAYGN) stock fell over 5% after the German pharmaceutical giant was ordered by a U.S. court to pay $2.25 billion in damages, the highest amount yet in its ongoing litigation linked to an alleged carcinogenic effect of its Roundup weedkiller.\n\nHolcim (SIX:HOLN) stock rose 5% after the Swiss building materials giant unveiled plans to separate and list its North American business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe European banking sector is likely to be in focus later this week as a number of the region’s major lenders release quarterly earnings.\n\nAdditionally, in the U.S., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.\n\nCrude gains on Middle East turmoil\n\nOil prices rose Monday on increased worries of disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nBy 03:25 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $78.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $83.21 a barrel.\n\nBoth contracts rose last week for a second week in a row and settled at their highest in nearly two months on Friday.\n\nThis attack was by Iran-backed militants, according to the U.S. President Joe Biden, and resulted in the death of three U.S. service members, the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.\n\nIran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns of a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nAdditionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $2,050.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0840.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures were trading lower during Sunday night, as investors turned attention to major technology earnings reports as well as the Federal Reserve interest rates decision.\n\nBy 6:35 pm ET (11:15 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures dipped 0.2% while S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.3% apiece.\n\nThe previous trading week saw all three major indexes rise, buoyed by positive economic data. The US economy displayed stronger-than-expected growth in Q4, while annual core inflation was lower than economists' predictions, hinting at a possible slowdown in price hikes. However, the market's gains were somewhat subdued compared to the rally of the week before, following disappointing earnings reports from major companies such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe upcoming week is set to be eventful, with the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting of the year on the agenda, accompanied by significant data releases such as the nonfarm payrolls, ISM Manufacturing PMI, and JOLTs job openings. The Fed is anticipated to keep interest rates at their 23-year high, with investors keen to discern any signals about the timing of rate cuts this year.\n\nOn the data front, it's expected that non-farm payrolls may have increased by 162K in January, a slowdown from the 216K rise in December. The unemployment rate is predicted to remain stable at 3.7% for a second period, while monthly wage growth is likely to ease to 0.3% from 0.4%. The ISM PMI is expected to continue signaling a contraction in the manufacturing sector at the year's start.\n\nInvestors will also be keeping a close eye on the ADP employment change, Q4 labor productivity and employment costs, factory orders, and regional industry indexes such as the Chicago PMI and Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index.\n\nThe ongoing earnings season will continue to make headlines, with a roster of key companies set to report, including tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and others such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX).\n\nStory continues\n\nStay up to date with the latest earnings results using InvestingPro!

        "title": "A Fed meeting, big tech earnings and the January jobs report: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks closed out another week hovering near record highs as one of the busiest weeks of the quarter is set to greet investors.\n\nEarnings from five of the\"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) — will highlight a packed week of quarterly reports. In all, 106 S&P 500 companies including six Dow components are slated to report in the week ahead, per FactSet.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Fed is set to announce its latest policy decision. Investors expect the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Investors will be closely watching for any commentary during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's conference on Wednesday about when the Federal Reserve may begin cutting rates.\n\nOn Friday, the January jobs report is set for release where economists expect a modest tick down in job additions while the unemployment rate is projected to remain flat at 3.7%.\n\nElsewhere on the schedule, key updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy, as well as the latest data on job openings, highlight the economic side of things.\n\nOutside of big tech, results from AMD (AMD), Starbucks (SBUX), Pfizer (PFE), CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Boeing (BA) headline the reporting calendar.\n\nStocks will enter the final week of the month near all-time highs. After a rocky start to the year, both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are up over 2% so far in January. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up more than 1%.\n\nThe market narrative has shifted significantly since the last time Jerome Powell took the podium in December. Investors aggressively priced in a March cut and then scaled back those bets as economic growth has continued to surprise to the upside.\n\nBut with inflation down to its lowest levels in nearly three years, many Wall Street economists still believe that the Fed will begin cutting in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It is time for Fed officials to take the win and start dialing back the level of policy restrictiveness soon,\" Capital Economics deputy chief US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nInvestor bets are still mixed on when that cut will come. As of Friday afternoon, markets had priced in a 47% chance the Fed cuts rates in March, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Looking out to May, investors believe there is a 88% chance rates are lower by the end of that meeting.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen expects the Fed to change its post-meeting statement to more neutral language about the restrictiveness of policy, serving as \"a de-facto easing bias.\" But he doesn't believe Powell and the central bank will fully tip their hand just yet.\n\n\"Labor markets have cooled, and inflation has come down more rapidly than expected absent a large rise in unemployment, but we don't think the Fed is ready to send a strong signal about its intentions just yet,\" Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell arrives to speak at a press conference following a closed two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve in Washington, U.S., December 13, 2023. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGapen believes the Fed will be buying time to see more data. And some of that data will come in the days following the Fed meeting.\n\nThe January jobs report is scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. And while layoffs have dominated headlines in recent weeks, economists expect any signs of a broad labor market slowdown to remain absent from the data.\n\nThe report is expected to show 175, 000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month with unemploymentticking up slightly to 3.8%, according to data from Bloomberg. In December, the US economy added 216,000 jobs while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%.\n\n\"All told, the themes of improving supply, cooling demand and overall labor market normalization likely continued in January,\" Wells Fargo's team of economists led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. \"Although payroll growth has held up remarkably well recently, there are several signs of further moderation in the months ahead. On net, fewer industries are adding headcounts each month and job openings and hiring plans continue to pull back.\"\n\nAs if the economic calendar alone wouldn't be enough to keep investors on their toes, the biggest corporate earnings week of the quarter will also set the stage for how companies are holding up amid the higher interest rate environment.\n\nAnalysis from FactSet on Friday shows just how much upcoming earnings could drive the market narrative. Excluding Tesla, the other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks are expected to be the top six earnings drivers for the S&P 500, contributing year-over-year earnings growth of 53.7%. Excluding those six companies the remaining 494 companies would report a 10.5% earnings decline.\n\nFive of those key companies — Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Apple — are set to report in the week ahead.\n\nEvercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, January (-9.3 prior)\n\nEarnings: Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) Phillips (PHG), SoFi Technologies (SOFI), Whirlpool (WHR)\n\nTuesday:\n\nEconomic data: S&P CoreLogic 20-city year-over-year NSA (4.87% prior);Conference Board consumer confidence, January (112.5 expected, 110.7 prior)JOLTS job openings, December (8.79 million prior); Dallas Fed services activity, January (-8.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Alphabet (GOOGL), Electronic Arts (EA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Juniper Networks (JNP), Match Group (MTCH), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), Microsoft (MSFT), Pfizer (PFE), Starbucks (SBUX), UPS (UPS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended January 26 (3.7%); ADP private payrolls, January (+150,000 expected, +164,000 prior); Employment cost index, fourth quarter (1.0% expected, 1.1% prior) Federal Reserve monetary policy decision (no interest rate change expected)\n\nEarnings: Aflac (AFL), Boeing (BA), Hess (HES), Mastercard (MA), MetLife (MET), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Phillips 66 (PSX), Qualcomm (QCOM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, January, (-20.2% prior); Unit labor costs, fourth quarter (+2.6% expected, -1.2% prior); Nonfarm productivity, fourth quarter (+1.6% expected, +5.2% prior); Initial jobless claims, week ending January 27 (214,000 prior); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, January final (50.3 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, December (+0.5% expected, 0.4% prior); ISM manufacturing, January (47.5 expected, 47.2 prior); ISM prices paid, January (45.2 prior)\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Deckers Brand (DECK), Honeywell (HON), Meta (META), Merck (MRK), Royal Caribbean Group (RCL), Peloton (PTON), SiriusXM (SIRI), Skechers (SKX), Tractor Supply (TSCO), The Clorox Company (CLX), United States Steel (X)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, January (+175,000 expected, +216,000 prior); Unemployment rate, January (3.8% expected, 3.7% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, January (+4.1% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, January (34.4 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, January (62.5% previously); U. of Mich sentiment, January final (78.8 expected, 78.8 prior); Factory orders, December (+0.5% expected, 2.6% prior); Durable goods orders, December final (0.0% prior)\n\nEarnings: Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Charter Communications (CHTR)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors wondering where the S&P 500 is headed, at least for the next month or so, will want to pay attention to three key days this week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSingapore’s $200,000 Toyotas Fuel Angst Over Widening Wealth Gap Houthi Hit on Russian Fuel Has Oil Traders Recalculating Risks US Fires on Houthi Missile Hours After Trafigura Ship Attack Giuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy Chinese Engineers Are Keeping Russia’s Metal Furnaces Firing\n\nBetween Tuesday and Thursday, five Big Tech companies with a combined market value of more than $10 trillion will report earnings: Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will issue its decision on interest rates, followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference where he’s expected to discuss the outlook ahead.\n\nThe stakes couldn’t be much higher, with the S&P 500 Index pushing deeper into record territory on bets that central bankers are poised to began easing monetary policies and tech behemoths like Microsoft getting more valuable by the day.\n\n“Tech disproportionately moved the market last year and big tech continues to have the biggest earnings power, so the results will be crucial for the markets,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.\n\nAfter a shaky start to the year, the S&P 500 is rising again and on pace for a third monthly advance that’s added more than 18% since late October, when the index hit a near-term low before Fed officials started signaling that rate hikes were over.\n\nThe rally is again being led by megacaps including Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Nvidia and Meta Platforms, which were responsible for a majority of the index’s 24% gain last year as investors became captivated by the possibilities of artificial intelligence services. The so-called Magnificent Seven, which also includes Tesla Inc., just hit a record 29% of the S&P 500 despite a slump in shares of the electric-vehicle maker that’s erased more than $200 billion in market value just this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Booming\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet will kick off earnings on Tuesday after markets close. The two companies are among the best positioned to benefit from the AI boom after investing heavily in the field for years. Microsoft has been adding the features to its suite of software products, and investors are betting that AI will soon start boosting profit and sales growth.\n\nOn Wednesday, the focus shifts to the end of the Fed’s January meeting, where it’s expected to hold interest rates steady for a fourth-consecutive meeting. Traders will be primarily focused on what Powell and other policymakers have to say about the timing of easing. Recent data showing inflation continuing to recede and resilient US economic growth suggest central bankers won’t be in a hurry to cut interest rates.\n\nApple is the biggest draw on Thursday, when Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms also report in the afternoon. The iPhone maker has been dogged by concerns about revenue growth and is expected to report its first sales expansion in four quarters.\n\nWith most of the megacaps in record territory, there are concerns that investors are over exposed to just a handful of stocks, which could open the door for some pain if quarterly results underwhelm.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks were again named the most crowded trade in a Bank of America survey of fund managers, according to a research note published by the bank last week.\n\nNo Protection\n\nStill, traders aren’t rushing to scoop up hedges against declines, according to options market data.\n\nA gauge of projected price swings in Apple in the next three months is hovering near the lowest level in six years. Traders expect a 3.3% move in the stock in either direction a day after the results, which would be among the narrowest post-earnings swings in two years.\n\nProjected three-month volatility in Meta Platforms, which more than quadrupled since its November 2022 nadir, is at the lowest in two years. The cost of protection against a 10% decline in Microsoft in the next month is hovering near the lowest level since August relative to the cost of options that profit from a similar rally.\n\nTesla demonstrated the risks last week after missing fourth-quarter earnings estimates and warning that its sales growth would be “notably lower” in 2024. The stock tumbled 12% the following day, its biggest drop in a year.\n\nMicrosoft recently overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company with a market value above $3 trillion. The rally has made the stock even more expensive, at 33 times profits projected over the next 12 months compared with an average of 24 times over the past decade.\n\nTo Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt, there’s no doubt the megacap trade is crowded. But that doesn’t mean the stocks can’t continue to rally with economic growth slowing and easing financial conditions.\n\n“There’s a good reason for the crowded trade,” he said. “The environment is good for them.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?

        "title": "Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead",
        "content": "Investing.com -- It’s set to be an action-packed week in markets with the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, a flurry of big tech earnings and the latest U.S. jobs report. The Bank of England also holds its first policy meeting of 2024 while data out of China is expected to remain gloomy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.\n\nFed ahead\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.\n\nInvestors have pushed expectations for the Fed’s first rate cut to May from March following recent strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that cuts may not be as aggressive as expected.\n\nData on Friday indicated that inflation is moderating but consumer spending remains robust, leading to concerns that price pressures could begin to mount again.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post policy meeting press conference for any insights into how officials have been interpreting recent economic data.\n\nJobs report\n\nHard on the heels of the Fed decision the U.S. is to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.\n\nThe recent stock market rally which has powered the S&P 500 to record highs has been driven by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.\n\nA weaker than expected reading could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe economic calendar also includes data on JOLTS job openings and consumer confidence on Tuesday, followed a day later by a report on private sector payrolls and weekly data on initial jobless claims on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nMegacap earnings\n\nEarnings will be a major focal point in the week ahead with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.\n\nWith the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum.\n\nCollectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.\n\n\"There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Reuters. \"If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose\" for the market as a whole.\n\nBank of England\n\nThe BoE is expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday and while it may drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds it is expected to indicate that rates need to remain restrictive for an extended period.\n\nThe latest U.K. jobs report showed that wage growth rose at the slowest pace in almost a year in the three months to November, but inflation unexpectedly rose to 4% in December.\n\nBritain's economy started 2024 on a stronger footing but data last week indicated that supply disruptions in the Red Sea are reigniting inflation in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe BoE raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023, taking rates to a peak of 5.25% after inflation surged to a 41-year high of 11.1% in late 2022.\n\nChina PMIs\n\nChina is to release official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday that is likely to show that the world’s second largest economy remains on a shaky footing.\n\nChina's economy expanded by 5.2% in 2023, but its post-pandemic recovery has been shaky, with a protracted housing downturn, mounting deflationary risks and slowing global growth casting clouds over the outlook for this year.\n\nChina's central bank announced last Wednesday that it was making a 50-basis point cut to bank reserves, the biggest in two years, sending a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and the country's plunging stock markets.\n\nStill, analysts say more stimulus is needed this year to get economic activity on more solid footing.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nUS reviewing Venezuelan sanctions policy in wake of court decision - State Dept\n\nFrench farmers keep Paris roadblock threat as protests endure",

        "content": "With the market reaching new all-time highs and kicking off a new bull market, it's becoming obvious that some stocks are getting overvalued. This leaves some investors searching for stocks they can buy without paying a significant premium.\n\nRecently, I added to my positions in five of my favorite companies, as I believe now represents a great time to invest in this group.\n\nAmazon\n\nIn my book, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a perfect buy in this environment. It's no longer a solely e-commerce investment, as it has other dominant business segments like advertising and cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, or AWS). Both businesses have higher margins than e-commerce, so Amazon's profit margins are seeing massive increases over time. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nUnlike previous periods when Amazon achieved high margins, this margin boost isn't influenced by external factors. Instead, it has all been powered by efficiency improvements and it looks sustainable.\n\nInvestors have yet to see what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, and I think 2024 could be a glimpse into that future. That's why I purchased the stock now.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is better known by its former name and main business segment, Google. While Alphabet may have artificial intelligence (AI) investments and a cloud computing division (Google Cloud), it's still primarily an advertising company, with nearly 80% of its revenue coming from ads. In late 2022 and through the first half of 2023, this was a bad business to be in, as companies were cutting ad budgets in preparation for a recession.\n\nHowever, that recession didn't come, and these clients are starting to open up their ad budgets again, boosting Alphabet's business. In Q3, Alphabet's ad revenue rose 9.5%, getting the company back on track to produce respectable growth. Alongside other efficiency improvements, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) rose from $1.06 to $1.55.\n\nThe return of ad-spending plus continuous efficiency improvements have given Alphabet a cheap price tag of 22 times forward earnings, which makes it a promising buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is a top company in Latin America, and its e-commerce, logistics, digital wallet, and consumer credit businesses have become dominant products in their respective fields. When many companies' growth slowed in 2023, MercadoLibre was still full speed ahead -- it never saw its revenue growth rate dip below 50% on a currency-neutral basis. In its latest quarter, it put up its fastest sales growth of the past year at 69% (from a currency-neutral basis).\n\nFurthermore, MercadoLibre has been improving margins, highlighted by its operating margin increase from 11% to 18.2% in Q3.\n\nDespite this success, MercadoLibre still trades at a lower price-to-sales valuation than most of the past decade. MELI PS Ratio Chart\n\nMercadoLibre still looks like a screaming deal now, and I'd have no problem adding even more to my position (even if it is already one of my largest positions right now).\n\ndLocal\n\ndLocal (NASDAQ: DLO) is a company few have heard of, but it is a true hidden gem. dLocal's software allows its customers (including Amazon, Google, Shopify,Spotify, and Nike) to sell their products in locations with less developed digital payment infrastructure.\n\nWhile each of these companies could build its own solution for countries like India, Indonesia, or Kenya, it's far easier to concede a small amount of revenue to dLocal in exchange for their systems already being tailored for each country.\n\nThis has proven wildly successful, and dLocal's financials tell a clear story. In Q3, dLocal's revenue rose 47% year over year to $164 million, and net income increased 25% to $40.4 million. That gives dLocal a respectable profit margin of 25%.\n\nDespite its excellent growth, strong profitability, and great business model, dLocal trades for just 22 times forward earnings, making it a great bargain.\n\nUiPath\n\nFinally, UiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a leader in the robotic process automation (RPA) space. This technology allows its users to automate repetitive tasks, and it has AI plug-ins to increase the number of tasks it can automate.\n\nIt's a favorite stock of Cathie Wood and her team at Ark Invest, and this stock is currently the second-largest position across all of Ark's portfolios. The company is growing at a brisk pace, with annual recurring revenue rising 24% to $1.38 billion in Q3 of FY 2024 (ending October 31). It also has a healthy net retention rate, with the average customer spending $121 for every $100 they spent last year.\n\nAs companies look to improve efficiency and integrate AI, UiPath will be a logical choice. The company's business should benefit from this trend throughout 2024 and beyond. However, UiPath's stock doesn't garner a massive premium like many AI-related stocks, trading for a reasonable 11 times sales today.\n\nSo UiPath is a great investment right now, and it could make you look like a genius if you buy and hold it for the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "My Top-5 AI Growth Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist for 2024",
        "content": "The S&P 500 recently reached a new record high, signaling a bull market is here, and that means it's a fantastic time to bet on growth. Bull markets tend to favor growth stocks, and history shows us these times of market gains last longer than bear markets -- on average almost three years versus nine months. So there's reason right now to load up on stocks that may excel in this sort of environment and benefit from the momentum.\n\nThat's why I've got my eye on companies involved in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI) from chipmakers that power AI tools to companies using this technology to improve their operations. At a compound annual growth rate of about 21%, the AI market is forecast to reach more than $2 trillion by 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights. Companies investing now could greatly benefit down the road -- and so could you. Here are my top-five AI growth stocks to buy hand over fist for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is almost synonymous with AI these days. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) power the training of AI systems, the \"deep learning\" that allows them to understand complex concepts and deliver answers to our questions.\n\nNvidia has built an 80%-to-95% share of the AI chip market, according to analysts, and that's unlikely to change any time soon for two reasons. First, Nvidia now is a clear leader, so it may be difficult for rivals to attract customers away from the industry's \"go-to\" chipmaker. Second, Nvidia invests heavily in research and development (R&D), so it should stay ahead thanks to innovation too. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia's R&D spending increased 18% to more than $2.2 billion.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia's investments are bearing fruit, with return on invested capital soaring in recent times. NVDA Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nNVDA Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia's revenue has climbed over the past few years as it broadened its dominance from GPUs to power gaming and graphics to leadership in AI. And the company's profit has advanced too. Considering Nvidia's financial strength and AI market share, the stock is a no-brainer AI buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAI is helping Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) excel in both its e-commerce and cloud-computing businesses. The company has used AI in e-commerce for a while now, in everything from making warehouse operations and fulfillment more efficient to helping you, the customer, find just the right item. So, here, AI helps Amazon gain in efficiency, thereby lowering costs. By offering you a positive shopping experience, you're likely to come back. That's a double victory for Amazon's earnings.\n\nAs for cloud computing, Amazon has developed several AI tools that it offers its customers. For example, Amazon Bedrock gives clients access to top foundation models they can customize for their own use -- without having to build from the ground up or manage infrastructure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also offers Code Whisperer, a service that suggests code to developers, saving them valuable time.\n\nGenerative AI is \"top of mind\" for clients, Amazon said in its recent earnings call, so AWS, as the world's cloud-market leader, is in the perfect place to benefit in the years to come.\n\n3. Moderna\n\nModerna (NASDAQ: MRNA) may not be the first company that comes to mind when you think of AI. After all, it's a biotech developing vaccines based on mRNA technology. But Moderna actually could be a winner of the AI revolution and is investing in the technology today to increase its chances of that happening.\n\nModerna uses AI across its entire business, even launching an \"AI academy\" to train employees. But where AI really might change the game is in the area of drug development.\n\nModerna applies AI to explore relationships between the vast amounts of data it's collected over the years to produce better candidates. The company even signed a collaboration with International Business Machines (IBM) last year to use its AI tools. For example, an IBM foundation model can help predict a molecule's properties, helping scientists immediately understand the characteristics of a potential medicine.\n\nThe idea is AI can help Moderna more quickly identify the best candidates, and that may speed up the drug-development process, bringing products to market faster. This could score a win for Moderna, patients, and investors.\n\n4. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic(NYSE: MDT) is another potential winner in the AI-in-healthcare market -- a market expected to reach $208 billion in 2030 from $32 billion today, according to Grand View Research. Like Moderna, Medtronic has put the focus on this hot technology, creating an AI Center of Excellence.\n\nThe medical device giant created the center of excellence to cost-effectively drive AI innovation across its businesses with the goal of maintaining leadership in AI-enabled healthcare. Medtronic already uses AI across many of its products from the GI Genius endoscopy tool to the Touch Surgery Enterprise platform for AI-enabled surgery. So, it's well on the way to being a major player in the AI-in-healthcare revolution.\n\nOn top of this, you'll like the fact that Medtronic, following a transformation plan to become more efficient, may be heading into a new era of growth. In the most recent quarter, Medtronic reported growth across its business segments and geographies. Considering Medtronic's products hold Nos. 1 to 3 market-share positions, this performance may continue over time.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), parent of search giant Google, already has delivered an impressive track record of growth, as seen in the chart below. GOOG Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nGOOG Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nNow, AI may be set to deliver a new boost. Your searches on Google are about to garner even better results thanks to Alphabet's focus on this potentially game-changing technology. Alphabet recently unveiled its most powerful AI tool yet, Gemini, and tests of Gemini in search have resulted in improvements in quality and speed.\n\nWhy is this important? Google holds more than 90% of the search market right now, making it the leader by far. Supercharging Google search's capabilities should reinforce this leadership. That, in turn, should keep advertisers flocking to Google. Since this is Alphabet's biggest source of revenue, keeping Google search at the top of its game is crucial.\n\nAlphabet plans on applying Gemini across its products, from its smartphone to its cloud-computing offerings, so this investment in AI should go pretty far when it comes to driving growth. And that's why Alphabet is a top AI stock to buy this year in the new bull market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Bob Bakish said he will issue layoffs at Paramount in new memo. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nIn an internal memo yesterday (Jan 25.), Paramount (PARA) Global CEO Bob Bakish outlined his strategy for the entertainment giant in the new year, which suggests job cuts are coming to the company’s approximately 24,500 employees. Bakish laid out three goals: maximizing content, driving to streaming profitability, and unlocking the power of “One Paramount”—or strengthening the company internally through more collaborations across sectors.\n\nBakish said in his memo the company will have to “manage costs” in order to “drive earnings growth.” “As it has over the past few years, this does mean we will continue to reduce our workforce globally,” the CEO said. “These decisions are never easy, but are essential on our path to earnings growth.”\n\nParamount, which is owned by National Amusements, is over $15 billion in debt. Last year, it laid off  25 percent of its U.S. staff and shuttered Showtime Sports and MTV News. The company has also been unloading assets like its book publisher Simon & Schuster and is looking to sell BET Network. There have been reports of Paramount considering selling itself, too. Skydance Media, the investment firm RedBird Capital and Warner Bros. Discovery have all been floated as possible buyers.\n\nBakish seemed to acknowledge merger chatters in yesterday’s memo, though he didn’t share much concrete information. “Amid all this change, it’s no surprise that Paramount remains a topic of speculation. We’re a storied public company in a closely followed industry,” Bakish said. “But I have always believed the best thing we can do is concentrate on what we can control—execution.”\n\nJanuary has been a difficult month for those working in media and tech. The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is looking to cut 20 percent of the staff at its animation studio Pixar, TechCrunch reported earlier this month. Amazon (AMZN) has axed “several hundred” jobs in its streaming and studio units and over 100 staffers in its Audible division.Google (GOOGL) has cut over 1,000 jobs this year so far in addition to the 12,000 it already slashed last year. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent Alphabet, said the company plans to cut more.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the editorial side, the Los Angeles Times and Business Insider both announced mass layoffs this past week. (It was the second round of cuts for Business Insider in less than a year.) Condé Nast-owned Pitchfork, known for its music critique and coverage of the underground music scene, was folded into GQ Magazine last week, also resulting in job cuts.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nCourt Concedes DNC Had the Right to Rig Primaries Against Sanders 'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning MrBeast's First X Video Raises More Questions Than Answers About X's Creator Program The Five Most Underrated Episodes Of 'The Sopranos' Bill Nye and the Doomsday Clock Scientists Call for Action\n\nRead the original story Paramount CEO Bob Bakish's 2024 Goals Suggest Layoffs and Possible Merger and others by Nhari Djan at Observer.",

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the Best Drug and Alcohol Rehab Centers in Each of the 30 Biggest Cities in the US. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the Best Drug and Alcohol Rehab Centers in Each of 10 Biggest Cities in the US.\n\nSubstance abuse is a disturbing problem that can have widespread debilitating effects on an individual, as well as their family. Drug addiction or substance abuse disorder, has been defined as a “disease that affects a person's brain and behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medicine”. Unfortunately, there are numerous ways in which one can develop a chronic substance-abuse problem. Whether it is in response to peer pressure in social gatherings or just an attempt to experience all aspects of adolescent life, out of control drug usage can materialize from common occurrences. Prescription drugs can also lead to a dependency on pain killers, thereby, initiating a potential path down the addiction road. Furthermore, evidence also points to the idea that people with prior mental disorders are more likely to develop addiction habits. Given the nature of the issue, proper treatment is crucial in order to deal with this affliction. Hence, the bestdrug and alcohol rehab centers, equipped with the required expertise and medical experience, are in fact the most viable solution.\n\nDepth of the Problem\n\nStatistics regarding drug and alcohol usage and death rate are indicative of the seriousness of the problem. Alcohol use alone has led to 2.3 million deaths worldwide. For the US, this figure stands at 95,000 and death by opioid overdose also amounts to 50,000 annually. 20% of the Americans have been reported for alcohol use disorder and 3.8% for opioids. There is also a huge prevalence of other drugs in the society. What is even more concerning is the alarming amount of population (half of the population below 12) being involved in illegal drug usage, at least once in their life. 70% of the people who experiment with illegal drugs before the age of 13 go on to become addicts in the next 7 years. Research has also brought to the forefront the fact that drug and substance abuse is most commonly found in young males within the age bracket of 18-25 years. Thus, a tenaciously extensive problem, that can hamper the future of a country, requires concentrated efforts and qualified help in order to effectively manage and mitigate its impact. The best drug and alcohol rehab centers in the US are offering to deal with this situation with highest quality of treatment, care and support.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial and Industry Aspect\n\nWhile there are multiple social costs associated with drug and alcohol addiction, the financial aspect is equally significant. In 2020, the Federal Budget allocated $35 million for drug control. For users, the monetary feature can take many shapes. For instance, the use of the substance itself -- obtained legally or illegally-- as well as other associated costs like loss of job or absence from work or any legal charges etc. can become cumbersome. Then the cost of treatment in the best drug and alcohol rehab centers also varies with the centers, where it ranges from free to affordable to all the way up to expensive. A rough estimate for substance use, for an individual, has been reported at $11,487. The type of treatment is yet another factor that would have a strong impact on total cost. The cost for an individual’s drug rehabilitation has been estimated at $1,583 annually.\n\nThe pandemic hit the US substance-use disorder treatment market adversely in 2020, when it registered a 20% fall in the size, as compared to 2019. However, the market size was reported at $37.24 billion in 2022, and is expected to reach $60.18 billion by 2029, at a CAGR of 7.1% during the forecast period. A growing number of people seeking treatment for the disorder and the availability of increased insurance have been cited as plausible forces behind the upward industry trend. Furthermore, the impact of technology in this industry is also engendering positive results by making virtual treatment options a possibility, thereby ensuring speedy and easy access.\n\nKey Players in the Market\n\nThere are many organizations -- private, non-profit, and public -- that are involved in mitigating the deleterious effects of substance use disorder. In this long list, while drug and alcohol rehab centers are the most important players, pharmaceutical companies also have a substantive role to play. They are developing and introducing better medications for combating drug effects on human body and psyche. ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAD) and TONIX Pharmaceutical Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: TNXP) are two very prominent names. Both are making constant head-ways in providing better coping mechanisms against substance use disorder. The big conglomerates like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) are also playing their part in giving back to the society by targeting such major problems.\n\nACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAD) and TONIX Pharmaceutical Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: TNXP) are both companies that aim to develop treatments for many central nervous system problems. ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAD) has only recently discovered GPR88agonists which is a G protein-coupled receptor. It has a potential to enable improved treatment for substance abuse and dependency, along with many more mental problems. TONIX Pharmaceutical Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: TNXP) is also busy developing improved drugs, including TNX-1300. This drug, called as “Breakthrough Therapy” by the FDA, is aimed at treating cocaine intoxication.\n\nApart from them, insurance companies are another important category of organizations that can make a huge difference. Their financial support can ensure that low-income people with addiction problems, reach out to drug and alcohol rehab centers in the US. Cigna Group (NYSE: CI) is one such company.\n\nCigna Group (NYSE:CI) covers drug rehab insurance. They provide insurance for in-patient treatment, contingent upon medical urgency. Cigna Group (NYSE: CI) has already made a difference in reducing the number of opioid overdoses (down by 18% by the end of 2021) through their Healthcare program, available in some areas of the country. They are also conscious of their employee’s mental health and are actively pursuing ways for enhancing it. They believe that aside from ensuring a supportive and positive work environment, companies can utilize AI techniques and health data to monitor their employee’s mental state.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

        "title": "Earnings Countdown: Mega-Cap Stocks Take the Stage Next Week",
        "content": "Although next week will not be the most numerous in earnings reports, it will be the most important. Five of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks will be reporting and the two largest American energy companies – sharing with investors some of the most valuable economic data in the world.\n\nThus far, the earnings season has been generally upbeat with the majority of stocks reporting thus far beating both earnings and revenue estimates.\n\nTechnology\n\nFrom the Zacks Earnings Trend Report from research head Sheraz Mian, he notes that:\n\n“For the Technology sector, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +18.7% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues. Had it not been for the strong Tech sector contribution, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index would be down -5.9% (instead of up +0.6% as a whole).\r\n\r\nThe ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ - Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) - will start reporting Q4 results in the next few days. Total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +38.3% from the same period last year on +12.5% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +54.2% higher earnings on +12.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q3.”\n\nWhich is quite incredible when you think about it. We have many analysts and commentators commenting on how large a portion of the S&P 500 the mega-cap tech stocks have become, but the sales and earnings growth they put up is simply undeniable.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the market closes, we will get earnings from Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL, and then on Thursday Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta Platforms META.\n\nI also want to note the valuations on the five tech stocks reporting next week. Although there is much talk of “its only the mag 7 dragging the market higher,” none of them have absurd valuations, and a couple are quite appealing.\n\nWe can see that Amazon and Microsoft have the loftiest forward earnings multiples, while Meta Platforms and Alphabet have the lowest and Apple is right in the middle. Both Meta Platforms and Alphabet are trading below their five-year median valuations of 23.3x and 24.2x respectively and are forecasting EPS to grow 21% and 17% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Microsoft and Apple are trading above their five-year median valuations of 31x and 26x respectively. These are obviously historical premiums, but not excessively high. Microsoft is anticipating annual EPS growth of 15.5% over the next 3-5 years and Apple 12.7%.\n\nAnd finally, Amazon, with the most premium valuation is actually the farthest below its five-year median of 72.5x. Admittedly, Amazon’s valuation has always been a bit of a conundrum, because the e-commerce business runs with such low margins, but these days it is balanced by Amazon Web services, which is the largest cloud-service provider. AMZN is projecting annual EPS growth of 28.5% over the next 3-5 years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nI think that this data can yield a fairly simple conclusion; based on valuations Meta Platforms and Alphabet are quite appealing, while Microsoft and Apple may have to work off their premium multiples before they are as attractive. Amazon looks appealing as well based on its very high earnings growth expectations.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Apple and Alphabet have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.\n\nEnergy\n\nRegarding earnings expectations, energy stocks are on the completely other side of the spectrum from Technology. From the Earnings Trend Report:\n\n“Sectors expected to experience the biggest earnings declines in Q4 include Autos, Basic Materials, Medical, Energy, and Transportation.”\n\nEnergy stocks have struggled over the last year primarily due to the easing of Oil prices. Following the start of Ukraine-Russia war, and easing of inflation, the price of crude oil has steadily fallen from the $130 highs to $78 today, with intermittent spikes up to $95.\n\nThis reflects the cyclical nature of investing in oil stocks and doesn’t come as to big a surprise. But even with expectations of falling YoY earnings, I think this sector is still rather appealing, and worth considering as investments.\n\nOn Friday, US oil majors Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron CVX report earnings before the market opens.\n\nLike the technology stocks, when looking at energy from a historical valuation perspective it is hard to deny the attractiveness. Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron are trading at very reasonable valuations of ~10x forward earnings, easing considerably from the three-year highs near 30x. But they are also below the 10-year medians, which both stand at ~17.7x.\n\nChevron and Exxon Mobil also both pay hefty dividends of 4% and 3.7% respectively and have structural tailwinds. The structural tailwinds are namely a broad underinvestment in oil and gas infrastructure, which is likely to keep oil supply low for the coming years.\n\nBoth Exxon Mobil and Chevron have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe energy and technology sectors offer two very different outlooks regarding earnings, yet both may be appealing based on valuations. Because they are such critical and leading industries in the country, discerning investors would be wise to hold some mix of the stocks shared.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "US Wants Cloud Firms to Report Foreign Users Building AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said her department is exploring how to force cloud companies to disclose when a foreigner taps their computing power to fuel artificial intelligence applications, signaling the next phase of the tech war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Seeing War Advantage Trump Ordered to Pay $83.3 Million for Defaming Carroll Giuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy MacKenzie Scott Pares Her Amazon Stake by $10 Billion One of World’s Richest Doctors Sees Fortune Surge to $12 Billion\n\n“We’re beginning the process of requiring US cloud companies to tell us every time a non-US entity uses their cloud to train a large language model,” Raimondo said at an event Friday, without naming any countries or firms.\n\nPresident Joe Biden in October directed the agency to require such disclosures in an effort to detect foreign actors that might use AI to launch “malicious cyber-enabled activity,” according to Biden’s directive.\n\nThe Commerce Department has also been looking into ways to regulate the cloud via export controls, following up on sweeping restrictions limiting China’s access to the most powerful semiconductors. The worry in Washington is that Chinese companies can access the same computing power of those chips through cloud providers such as Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp.’s Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud.\n\nRead More: US to Tighten Rules Aimed at Keeping Advanced Chips Out of China\n\n“We want to make sure we shut down every avenue that the Chinese could have to get access to our models or to train their own models,” Raimondo said in an interview last month.\n\nChina’s development of AI and other next-generation technologies is a top concern for the administration, which sees Beijing as its primary global strategic competitor. Washington has tried to rein in China’s advances by restricting chip exports to the country and sanctioning individual Chinese firms, but the country’s tech giants have managed to make significant breakthroughs despite US curbs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US in October tightened its controls to capture more chips, equipment and geographies. One key update targeted Chinese-headquartered companies operating in more than 40 countries, an attempt to prevent those firms from using other nations as intermediaries to secure semiconductors they can’t access at home.\n\nBut what the rules didn’t address is Chinese firms’ ability to tap into the capabilities of those chips via the cloud.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how the US would regulate that type of activity. Cloud services don’t involve the transfer of physical goods, and Commerce has specifically said they are beyond the domain of export controls. Thea Kendler, assistant secretary for export administration, told lawmakers last month that “we may need additional authority in that space.”\n\nUS cloud providers have worried that restrictions on their activities with overseas users without comparable measures by allied countries risks disadvantaging American firms.\n\nThe Commerce Department will separately survey companies that are developing large language models about the results of their safety tests, Raimondo said Friday, though she didn’t provide details about what they will request. Large language models, or LLMs, are the software behind AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\nThe potential new requirements come as the Federal Trade Commission opened a separate antitrust inquiry into AI partnerships.\n\nRead More: Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft Face FTC Inquiry on AI Partners\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Alphabet didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n--With assistance from Dina Bass and Matt Day.\n\n(Updates with details and context throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?

        "title": "The generative AI smartphone age is here",
        "content": "Generative AI is coming to your smartphone. Yes, the biggest technology trend in years is landing on your most important device. But how exactly it will impact your everyday life is still unclear.\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung are leading the generative AI charge with their latest smartphones, the Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 lineup, and you can expect others to join the fray, including Apple (AAPL), throughout 2024 and beyond.\n\nAnalysts say generative AI capabilities will quickly become table stakes for companies. That will also help tech giants hoping to woo potential smartphone customers and spawn a new upgrade cycle at a time of anemic device sales.\n\n“I think in the not-too-distant future, all phones will have some level of these capabilities,” explained TECHnalysis Research founder and president Bob O’Donnell. “It's the kind of thing that I think … people can just start to expect.”\n\nAccording to analysts at UBS, generative AI smartphones will start off slow but increase in sales rather fast.\n\n“Combining Apple, smartphone and other Android brands, we project Gen AI smartphones to ramp from 50 [million units] or 4% penetration in 2023 to 583 [million units] or 46% penetration in 2027,” UBS analysts said in a January research note. Samsung is banking on its Galaxy AI offerings to boost sales of its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones. (Samsung) (samsung)\n\nSo what can you expect from AI smartphones beyond what your current device can already do? That’s still a surprisingly open question.\n\nGenerative AI on the go\n\nBeyond a few apps and features for existing software such as the ability to improve video calls or run photo editing programs locally, companies are light on details as to how generative AI will change the overall user experience.\n\nOn the PC side, Microsoft is loading its Copilot app onto Windows 11 machines, but that’s a web-based platform that doesn’t require any particular hardware on your side.\n\n“If I compare PCs and smartphones, I think there's much more hope that smartphones will actually start to, over time, demonstrate real value from AI and Gen AI,” explained Gartner senior research director Ranjit Atwal.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to UBS analysts, generative AI-capable smartphones could improve multimedia content creation; enable fast photo and video editing; and provide better speech-to-text, translation, and enhanced gaming capabilities. Samsung and Google are already offering powerful generative AI photo editing and translation capabilities in their latest devices.\n\nLike all things related to smartphones, Apple will play an outsized role in how generative AI technology makes its way into our devices. But how the company does so will be just as interesting as when it adds the feature to its iPhones.\n\n“Will they do it through Siri and then Siri automatically talks to the other apps, which would be a different way of presenting the same capability? Or … are they going to do something else? I think the devil is going to be in the details of how it’s implemented,” O’Donnell said.\n\nHowever Apple decides to bring generative AI to the iPhone, though, it will have a distinct advantage over rival Samsung, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster explained.\n\nThat’s because Apple controls every aspect of the iPhone, from the software to the hardware right down to the chip that powers it all. That kind of capability should help Apple ensure that the overall experience is as seamless as possible.\n\nIt also doesn’t hurt that Apple has been taking advantage of the neural engine in its A-series chips for years to help power a number of on-device machine learning processes. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to Apple soothsayer Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will bring generative AI capabilities including auto-summarization for long text and auto-complete writing tools and add generative AI features to the company’s developer tools. Apple, Gurman says, will debut those features at its annual WWDC developer conference in June.\n\nThat, however, also means that Apple will be well behind Google and Samsung in bringing generative AI capabilities to market.\n\nBut with the full extent of generative AI technologies for smartphones still up in the air, it might not actually matter.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Big Tech Announces Another Round of Job Cuts As It Continues Its Expensive Efforts To Turn GenAI Into Business Magic",
        "content": "According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) hold the highest cash and short-term investment balances among nonbanking companies in the S&P 500 community. Although they are not hurting cash-wise, they are also quite careful about their spending.\n\nAmazon and Google-parent Alphabet entered the new year by announcing more layoffs. Last year, Amazon, Google, along with Microsoft, Meta and Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM), trimmed their respective workforces by 6% to 13%, but layoffs started back in 2022, costing several thousand employees their jobs.\n\nNew Round Of Layoffs Suggests Big Tech Bit Off More It Can Chew\n\nLast week, Google announced its job cuts across engineering and hardware teams as it continues its push for greater efficiency. Although other parts of the tech giant were affected, mostly impacted were workers in hardware, central engineering and Google Assistant voice-activated software product. As it continues to keep up with its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon, Google eliminated about 12,000 jobs last year under the leadership of Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud titan, Amazon laid off hundreds across Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios divisions, taking the overall job cuts to 27,000. Last year alone, Amazon laid off about 18,000 employees.\n\nCutting Jobs To Fund AI Efforts\n\nAlthough it seems like a strange time for job cuts considering that Big Tech ended 2023 by exiting the post-pandemic slump with the recovery of online advertising, Big Tech is in an expensive arms race to build AI services. Therefore, it is not a surprise that Google and Amazon opted to continue the trend of cost-cutting efforts, while streamlining operations and focusing on key projects. But even though this year will bring increased AI spending, its impact on revenue will likely be limited. Although generative AI is expected to pay out big-time, but turning GenAI magic into the desired top and bottom-line business impact will take time. Microsoft gained the early lead in the AI-race thanks to its partnership with the ChatGPT creator, OpenAI, but Amazon and Google are determined to catch up and to do so, they will need to spend their billions wisely.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "EPAM Systems EPAM recently launched its Retail Media Orchestration Toolkit, built in collaboration with Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud. This toolkit is developed to solve the challenges that retailers face while scaling their business through retail media advertising space.\n\nEPAM’s Toolkit is developed as part of Alphabet’s Google Cloud Industry Value Network (IVN) initiative, which aims to create flexible solutions for retail media. IVN functions in collaboration with integrators, independent software vendors and content partners to build pre-integrated solutions.\n\nThe Toolkit unifies features, including multichannel reporting, automated omnichannel measurement for understanding sales impact, advanced audience creation using Google Cloud analytics and insightful analysis of brand and consumer data. These features will enable brands to create effective campaigns and make informed media investment decisions.\n\nSalesforce CRM and Moloco are among the first to work closely with EPAM to incorporate and utilize the toolkit's features like providing feedback, testing functionalities and exploring use cases together. The use of this toolkit will increase with the influx of more large-scale brands as the retail media will improve by 9.3% from 2022 to 2028, as suggested by the data released by WPP’s GroupM and IPG Mediabrands’ Magna.\n\nEPAM's collaboration with Alphabet to enter into the retail Media advertising space is not its first significant cloud-based partnership. The company has been steadily enhancing its cloud capabilities after collaborating with Amazon’s AMZN division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\n\nEPAM Systems is an Advanced AWS Consulting Partner and offers various AWS cloud services to tackle common cloud issues. EPAM helps businesses migrate to the cloud, develop cloud-native solutions or manage services and provide other customized AWS cloud solutions.\n\nEPAM is set to benefit significantly from the growth of the cloud computing market. According to a report by MarketsAndMarkets, the cloud computing market is projected to reach $1.24 trillion in 2028 from $626.4 billion in 2023, witnessing a compound annual growth rate of 15.1% during the forecast period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is benefiting from the ongoing digital transformation in businesses and their emphasis on customer engagement and product development. However, the near-term outlook for EPAM appears dim due to a slow demand environment, with organizations becoming more cautious about IT spending amid macroeconomic challenges. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict is expected to persist, causing disruptions to the company's business operations in the near term, as many of its delivery centers are located in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Media layoffs: Google, Paramount, Disney and others commit to job cuts in 2024",
        "content": "The media and entertainment industry's reckoning will continue in 2024 with more layoffs as rising costs and debt-ridden balance sheets continue to weigh on the embattled sector.\n\nPartly in an attempt to appease Wall Street, these companies over the past year have slashed billions of dollars' worth of costs. In addition, under profit pressuere, they rolled out ad-supported tiers, bundled their offerings, and raised the monthly prices of subscription plans.\n\nBut all of that wasn't enough to satisfy investors.\n\nValuation levels remain depressed. And streaming profitability still has a long way to go, with virtually all media companies (with the exception of Netflix) losing money on that business. The bottom line: more job cuts.\n\nHere's what top media and entertainment companies have in mind when it comes to layoffs in 2024: Media layoffs: Google's YouTube, Paramount, Disney and others others commit to layoffs in 2024 (Photo by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nParamount Global\n\nAs M&A rumors swirl about the future of the Paramount Global (PARA), CEO Bob Bakish announced layoffs in an internal memo obtained by Yahoo Finance on Thursday.\n\nThe executive cited the need to \"operate as a leaner company and spend less.\"\n\n\"As it has over the past few years, this does mean we will continue to reduce our workforce globally. These decisions are never easy, but are essential on our path to earnings growth,\" the memo read.\n\nNo specific numbers or timeline was provided. Paramount reports quarterly results on Feb. 28.\n\nYoutube\n\nNot even tech giant Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has been immune to layoffs.\n\nLast week, the company cut 100 YouTube employees from its creator management and operations divisions, a spokesperson confirmed to Yahoo Finance — its first corporate restructuring in a decade. YouTube has 7,173 employees worldwide.\n\nAccording to an internal memo viewed by Yahoo Finance, the cuts will effect YouTube’s creator management and operations teams.\n\nThe workforce reduction comes after Alphabet slashed thousands of jobs across its engineering, hardware and advertising teams in an effort to reduce headcount.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a widely cited internal memo that more layoffs were likely needed across the entire company in 2024 in order for the company to reach its goals.\n\nUnited Music Group\n\nUniversal Music Group (UMG), one of the industry's most prominent record labels, plans to lay off hundreds of employees later this quarter, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe layoffs, part of a broader restructuring, will supposedly be the largest since the company went public in 2021, Bloombergnoted.\n\nWhile UMG wouldn't fully confirm the report, a spokesperson hinted at the cuts in a company statement provided to Yahoo Finance: \"We are creating efficiencies in other areas of the business so we can remain nimble and responsive to the dynamic market, while realizing the benefits of our scale.\"\n\nPixar\n\nDisney's (DIS) animation unit will reportedly lay off as much as 20% of its 1,300 workforce, according to TechCrunch. The cuts come as streaming profitability lags while the company's box office has struggled.\n\nDisney did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for confirmation on the report. Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville, CA, United States - June 5, 2023. Pixar Animation Studios is an American computer animation studio. (JHVEPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nThe online publication, a subsidiary of German publisher Axel Springer SE, said Thursday it will cut \"about 8%\" of its staff — a recent trend that's permeated across major news organizations throughout the country. (See Los Angeles Times next.)\n\n\"We closed out last year with a plan in place, a clear target audience, and a vision,\" Business Insider CEO Barbara Peng wrote in a memo to staff. \"This year is about making it happen and focusing our company and efforts towards this future. Unfortunately, this also means we need to scale back in some areas of our organization.\"\n\nThe exact number of impacted employees was not immediately clear, but the cuts do represent the second round of layoffs in less than a year.\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nThe Los Angeles Times announced sweeping layoffs on Tuesday that eliminated the jobs of at least 115 staff members, or roughly 20% of its newsroom.\n\nThe workforce reduction was the largest in the newspaper's 142-year history, according to the Times.\n\nThe paper's owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, said the cuts were necessary in order to account for the loss of as much as $40 million a year due to a bleak advertising environment.\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nOne of the most storied sports publications laid off most (or possibly all) of its staff last week after its publisher, Arena Group Holds, had its license to operate the publication revoked.\n\nArena Group failed to make a $3.8 million quarterly licensing payment to Authentic Brands Group, which has owned the magazine since 2019. Authentic Brands Group sold the publishing rights to Arena Group in a ten-year deal that same year.\n\n\"This is another difficult day in what has been a difficult four years for Sports Illustrated under Arena Group,\" the publication's union wrote in a statement following the news.\n\nOUR STATEMENT on layoffs at Sports Illustrated. 'We expect The Arena Group to honor all the terms of our union contract and will fight for every one of our colleagues to be treated fairly.' https://t.co/6yXE2cDW5apic.twitter.com/XsNTLr4MqA\n\n— NewsGuild of New York (@nyguild) January 19, 2024\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Five of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech megacaps will report earnings next week, with artificial-intelligence investment, regulatory challenges and waning China demand among the shared themes in focus.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGiuliani Lists Yankees Loot, Trump Claim as Assets in Bankruptcy US Fires on Houthi Missile Hours After Trafigura Ship Attack MacKenzie Scott Pares Her Amazon Stake by $10 Billion Gas-Addicted Europe Trades One Energy Risk for Another Putin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Seeing War Advantage\n\nAlong with Microsoft Corp., which just hit a historic $3 trillion market valuation, Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are set to post record revenues for the quarter, underscoring the strength of the US economy. Even so, they are likely to be asked about further cost reductions after the significant job cuts they have each embarked on in recent weeks.\n\nApple Inc., grappling with slowing China sales, antitrust accusations and bruised from a patent fight, could give investors a better sense of early demand for its new Vision Pro, which some big-name developers are steering clear of. Boeing Co., mired deep in a safety crisis that prompted the US Federal Aviation Administration to freeze a planned production increase of 737 Max, will face more questions about how it plans to allay concerns over the quality of its aircraft.\n\nMonday: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday: Microsoft (MSFT US) is set to post a 16% jump to record quarterly sales, with TD Cowen seeing strength in its Azure segment from returning cloud customers and rising AI demand. The monetization of its AI-powered virtual assistant Copilot will be scrutinized though the product won’t make significant topline contributions until later this year, Evercore said.\n\nAlphabet’s (GOOGL US) earnings per share is seen rising 52%, with Jefferies pointing to ad revenue growth in the year-end quarter and the ramping up of NFL Sunday Ticket channel on YouTube as driving forces. Its Google Cloud segment should see “measured and gradual” growth as customers prepare for AI deployments, Jefferies added. Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD US) AI exposure will help drive sales 9.5% higher, in contrast to Qualcomm (QCOM US), which is seen revealing a stagnant topline when it reports Wednesday despite a rebound in its handset and automotive segments. Starbucks’ (SBUX US) North American same-store sales growth is projected to about halve to 5.8% from the same period a year ago. Domestic sales were volatile in November and December amid union walkouts and social-media calls to boycott the coffee chain over its perceived response to the Israel-Hamas war, William Blair noted. General Motors (GM US) deliveries were flat in the quarter as strikes cut output at four plants that make the automaker’s top-selling models. Despite the dropoff — deliveries were up 41% the same period a year ago — profit could still beat expectations as US production likely outpaced sales to account for lost output during the strike, Bloomberg Intelligence said. UPS (UPS US) adjusted earnings per share will slide by double-digits for the fourth quarter in a row, weighed down by higher costs from its new labor contract and tepid shipping growth. Investors will want to gauge the firm’s progress on winning back market share lost during fraught labor talks and hear about the impact of Red Sea shipping disruptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday: Boeing (BA US) will see operating profit of $287 million, snapping a five-quarter streak of losses on more commercial-aircraft deliveries and strong services demand. With its growth ambitions dented by the US Federal Aviation Administration’s move to freeze planned production increases for the 737 Max aircraft, executives are set to face intense scrutiny on the company’s next steps.\n\nMastercard (MA US) should be able to raise earnings per share by 16% for the quarter as cuts to expenses offset slowing revenue growth and increased buybacks. Company guidance for 2024 should be in line with consensus, Baird said.\n\nThursday: Apple (AAPL US) may score a modest beat on earnings estimates despite slowing sales in China, Evercore said, noting that a patent dispute involving its smartwatches should have little impact. Initial signs point to strong demand for the Vision Pro headset which, along with AI-driven features on its iPhones, could drive growth this year, Bank of America said. Investors will want more color on its overhaul of its App Store and iPhone features in the European Union to appease regulators..\n\nMeta’s (META US) 2023 ad revenue growth was fueled by Chinese e-commerce platforms but whether the Facebook parent can rely on the likes of Shein and Temu this year remains to be seen, given simmering China-US tensions, BI said. Meta may also need to focus investments in its large-language model to improve ad targeting amid declining user engagement. Amazon (AMZN US) may beat expectations for a low-double-digit revenue gain — consensus calls for 11% — given a stronger-than-expected holiday season and sequentially improving sales at Amazon Web Services, BI said. The addition of ads to its Prime video service, along with its cloud order book and insights on consumer shopping trends, will be in focus.\n\nFriday: Exxon Mobil (XOM US) has warned of a $2.5 billion writedown in some of its California operations in guidance released this month. Gas trading and downstream-derivative tailwinds shored up its profits, TD Cowen said, though consensus estimates point to a 35% fall in earnings per share. Lower oil prices have also dragged Chevron’s (CVX US) profits lower as earnings per share is seen retreating 21% with an LNG pricing uptick failing to offset lower refining margins.\n\nCharter Communications (CHTR US) investors may focus on broadband subscriber numbers after its fight with Walt Disney over fees left its pay-TV customers temporarily unable to view channels backed by the entertainment giant. Broadband revenue could still get a boost from better average revenue per user gains with the end of promotional discounts, BI said. Cigna’s (CI US) earnings per share likely jumped 32%, more than double the previous quarter’s rate, amid a rise in medical customers and a largely stable medical loss ratio. Medical costs, forecast 14% higher in the quarter, is a concern, especially after health insurance peer Humana’s recent move to cut its forecast on higher-than-anticipated expenses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire How the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?

        "title": "Electronic Arts (EA) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?",
        "content": "Electronic Arts EA is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jan 30.\r\n\r\nFor third-quarter fiscal 2024, EA expects GAAP revenues between $1.825 billion and $2.025 billion and diluted earnings in the range of $0.75-$1.01 per share.\r\n\r\nFor the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at $2.91 per share in the past 30 days. The figure indicates 7.38% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a 1.86% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 12.95%.\r\n\r\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\n\nElectronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Electronic Arts Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nElectronic Arts Inc. price-eps-surprise | Electronic Arts Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nSteady demand for EA’s digital and live services across its portfolio is expected to have aided active user growth in the fiscal third quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, Electronic Arts announced the release of EA SPORTS NHL 24, the latest installment of the hockey game. EA also launched EA SPORTS WRC, the official game of the FIA World Rally Championship.\r\n\r\nEA SPORTS UFC 5, the latest game of the martial arts franchise, was also released in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, an increase in active users after the release of blockbuster games like EA SPORTS FIFA and Apex Legends is expected to have boosted net bookings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Apex Legends Season 18 drove greater-than-anticipated player acquisition and monetization in the fiscal second quarter. The momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nOn Oct 6, EA announced strong engagement of players in its EA SPORTS FC ecosystem, including both EA SPORTS FC 24 and EA SPORTS FC Mobile, in the first week after its launch.\r\n\r\nNet bookings for the fiscal second quarter were $1.82 billion, up 3.8% year over year or 5% in constant currency.\r\n\r\nThe company expects net bookings between $2.25 billion and $2.45 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for bookings is currently pegged at $2.383 billion, indicating a rise of 1.8% year over year.\r\n\r\nEA's strength in Live Services in mobile game franchises, such as Battlefield 2042, It Takes Two, Madden Mobile, FIFA Mobile, Tetris, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is expected to have positively impacted the top line.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, EA announced the launch of EA SPORTS FC Tactical, a new mobile game that focuses on turn-based strategy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company has been witnessing increased operating expenses for game development and marketing. The rising expenses are expected to have kept margins under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nSluggishness in video game spending in the quarter is expected to have reflected in EA’s top-line growth. Per VentureBeat, which cited NPD data on consumer spending on video games, video game spending declined 5% in October and 7% in November. For the month of December, video game sales remained mostly even, with a slight 4% increase in total sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.\r\n\r\nEA currently has an Earnings ESP of -2.65% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some stocks worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nApple is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1.

Smith AOS has an Earnings ESP of +3.80% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nA. O. Smith is set to report its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AOS’ earnings is pegged at 95 cents per share, suggesting growth of 10.5% from the prior-year period’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nAlphabet GOOGL has an Earnings ESP of +2.26% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 30.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its product offerings on the back of its growing generative AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company recently added generative AI features, namely “Tab Organizer” and a theme maker, to Chrome 121.\r\n\r\nNotably, the Tab Organizer feature automatically creates tab groups based on open tabs by tapping the downward-facing icon in the top-left corner on Windows or right in macOS.\r\n\r\nFurther, the feature provides a Tab Group suggestion with a name and emoji, which users must manually accept and can be rated up or down.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Chrome now allows users to create custom themes for the New Tab Page using a generative AI text-to-image diffusion model, offering six suggested options and recent creations.\r\n\r\nThese new generative AI feature additions are expected to boost traffic on the Chrome browser. This, in turn, is expected to bolster the Google Services segment, which has been the key growth catalyst for Alphabet.\n\nExpanding Generative AI-Backed Offering\n\nApart from the latest generative AI additions to Chrome, Google's Art Selfie 2 uses generative AI to match users' faces with existing artworks, allowing them to find doppelgangers.\r\n\r\nFurther, Art Selfie 2 uses generative AI to create a stylized image of users’ faces, blending your selfie into a chosen scenario, allowing hair, head coverings, jewelry and clothing to be replaced.\r\n\r\nAlphabet also introduced an AI support assistant, which allows users to expand and ask questions, with the option to leave a thumb-up or down, view answer sources and suggest follow-up questions, enhancing its generative AI capabilities for virtual assistance.\r\n\r\nThe company is also set to introduce a generative AI-powered “Help me write” feature to Chrome for Desktop use. This new AI feature can adjust its writing style, including \"Shorten\" or \"Elaborate\" options, as well as \"Casual\" or \"Formal\" options, with fewer options than Docs or Messages.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing endeavors to infuse generative AI capabilities into its product offerings will result in an enhanced user experience, allowing Alphabet to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the generative AI market space.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market is expected to reach $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects in the promising gen AI market is expected to benefit Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntensifying Competition\n\nThe latest move is likely to aid Alphabet in strengthening its competitive position against peers like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META, which are also making continuous efforts to capitalize on the growth opportunities present in the booming generative AI market.\r\n\r\nNotably, Microsoft’s OpenAI introduced the GPT Store to create a marketplace for specialized chatbot agents based on their language models, particularly ChatGPT, allowing users to create unique agents for various purposes like salary negotiation and recipe development.\r\n\r\nFurther, Microsoft plans to offer users the ability to customize Copilot, a generative AI assistant, with customized versions called Copilot GPTs. These GPTs will be tailored for specific purposes like fitness, travel, or business.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Amazon announced generative AI capabilities for its virtual assistant Alexa, optimizing voice interactions, real-time information, smart home control and entertainment.\r\n\r\nAmazon also unveiled Titan Image Generator, a generative AI model that can create new or customize existing images, currently available in preview on Bedrock's AI development platform. This image generator tool uses English natural language prompts to create realistic images for advertising, e-commerce and media.\r\n\r\nMeta, on the other hand, unveiled Meta AI, an advanced conversational assistant for WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3, providing real-time information and photorealistic images.\r\n\r\nMeta AI uses Meta’s state-of-the-art foundational language model, Llama 2, for text-based chats, accessing real-time information through Bing's search partnership and offering image generation tools.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +8.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 6.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 points to a change of +26.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 indicates a change of +16.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12%. The $254.87 billion and $284.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $64.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $1.55 for the same period compares with $1.06 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.45%. The EPS surprise was +6.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alphabet surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is implementing layoffs of close to 700 employees, about 1% of its 70,000-strong workforce, following a previous reduction of 10% or around 8,000 workers in 2023.\n\nThis move comes amid ongoing cost-cutting pressures from investors, including activist shareholders like Elliott Management, to drive its margins.\n\nDespite these cuts, Salesforce still maintains 1,000 open positions, suggesting these layoffs are part of workforce adjustments rather than a significant strategic shift, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe company’s focus is on directing spending towards growth.\n\nLast September, Salesforce also shared plans to hire nearly 3,300 new employees across various departments, focusing significantly on sales, engineering, and developing the company’s data cloud product.\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft’s Bing Sees Modest Growth with ChatGPT Integration, But Google Still Leads the Search Market\n\nThese steps have contributed to a significant boost in its stock value, which increased by almost 80% over the last 12 months, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 37% rise.\n\nTech firms increasingly focus on artificial intelligence (AI), leading to a hiring surge in this area while other sectors face layoffs into 2024.

        "title": "Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks",
        "content": "In the last 10 years, Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) has experienced an annual average price return of around 19%, with a median dividend yield of 1.43%. That puts the total investment return at around 20% as an annual average over that period. I expect these returns are quite likely to continue, especially considering favorable future revenue estimates. The largest fundamental risk for the company seems to be its balance sheet.\n\n2024 operations updates\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nOn Jan. 16, Oracle released its first quarterly Critical Patch Update, or CPU, of the year. It addressed an important set of vulnerabilities across its product families. Around 389 new security patches are included, which target 191 common vulnerabilities and exposures, or CVEs. Thirty-seven of the patches are considered critical, focusing on fixing severe security risks.\n\nThe company's Financial Services Applications received 71 new security patches. Oracle Communications received 55 patches and Oracle Fusion Middleware received 40 patches. The CPU also addresses potential security weaknesses in MySQL, Java SE and the E-Business Suite.\n\nThese updates are crucial at a time when advanced technology companies like Oracle are expanding and adapting toward artificial intelligence and facing a range of threats from criminal organizations that are also utilizing such technologies. The updates should maintain the company's market position and keep clients' trust after a difficult period of heightened cybercrime. By 2025, worldwide cybercrime costs are estimated to reach a staggering $10.5 trillion annually, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.\n\nThe company's investments in advanced technology seem to be paying off, driving revenue growth and positioning it well in the cloud services industry. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Oracle reported a year-over-year total revenue increase of 9%. In the second quarter, it reported a year-over-year total revenue increase of 5%. The growth in the second quarter was largely driven by a 25% surge in cloud revenue, both IaaS and SaaS. The company has also been aggressively expanding into cloud data centers. Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison has noted that this reflects Oracle's commitment to high demand for cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial analysis\n\nOracle has particularly strong earnings growth as opposed to revenue growth historically. The chart below shows around a decade of plateaued revenue growth, which has now begun to increase. The second chart shows reliable earnings per share without non-recurring items growth over the last decade, albeit with periods of volatility. Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks\n\nBecause the company has focused on high-margin products, including databases and enterprise software, this can support earnings growth even when revenue increases are lacking. Oracle's continued shift toward cloud computing services is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the future. The recurring revenue model associated with cloud services leads to steady and predictable revenue streams that could contribute to maintaining around 20% annual total investment returns for shareholders over the next decade.\n\nOracle has a high net margin compared to its industry peers. At 19.64%, the major competitors that beat it on this metric are Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) at 27.97%, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) at 21.05% and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) at 22.25%. However, this should not undermine the company's strength in this area, as its net margin is ranked better than 90.93% of companies in the software industry, according to GuruFocus.\n\nTo help drive net margin growth, the company has been focusing on artificial intelligence, specifically through its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or OCI. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other leaders in the field have endorsed OCI's GPU clusters for AI infrastructure, reflecting strength in the area. In addition, Oracle is forming partnerships to focus on private and secure AI cloud services, which should further drive top-line growth and, more significantly, make it more efficient, creating further opportunities for net margin expansion.\n\nOracle has a strong record of repurchasing stock, doing so every single year on record since 2008. While its repurchasing rates have varied from under $1 billion in 2010 to $36.64 billion in 2019, the continuous effect of such financial management is highly beneficial for shareholders who are interested in price returns from the stock as opposed to dividends.\n\nValuation\n\nOracle does seem highly valued at the moment. Even with the GF Value line showing it to be fairly valued, I think the stock's valuation is a risk that investors need to consider. Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks\n\nIt has a price-earnings ratio of around 30.50 and a forward price-earnings ratio of around 20, which is more or less average for the industry it is in. However, if there is any slowdown in growth due to regulatory pressures surrounding its cloud infrastructure and AI services, the stock could see unwarranted volatility. This is true insofar as these regulatory risks are not already priced in. My perspective is they are not fully accounted for, leading to a potential slight overvaluation in the stock at present.\n\nTo get some perspective on the company's price-earnings ratio relative to its major industry peers, Adobe has a forward ratio of around 34, Synopsys of around 37 and Fortinet of around 37.\n\nBalance sheet and competitive risks\n\nOracle's balance sheet is one of the largest risks for the stock as its total liabilities have risen from 43.71% of assets in 2012 to 96.74% in the last trailing 12 months. Around 61.39% of assets are balanced by long-term debt right now, and the company issues debt on a regular basis, with only two years of no issuance since 2015. However, its cash flow from financing is usually negative due to the regular repurchase of common stock. I think this shows a financial management team far more focused on growth than the balance sheet; my only concern with this strategy is that too far an overextension could result in more moderate growth long term as a matter of equilibrium. The company might find itself needing to divert its resources to servicing debt, leaving less available for growth strategies and shareholder returns. During a severe economic crisis, the company's current level of debt would make it less agile to deal with the challenges.\n\nThe company is also going to face significant competition in cloud infrastructure, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Compute Engine. These companies have IaaS offerings and cloud solutions like private servers, bare metal servers and cloud-based object storage services. AWS is known for its extensive range of options, like EC2 and CloudFormation, providing security and tailorable compute capacity and resource management. Microsoft Azure has a global network of data centers and strong scaling capacity, while Google Compute Engine has notable security benefits and elastic load balancing.\n\nThe competition in these areas is fierce, and whether Oracle will be a dominant player is yet to be seen in many respects. It remains positioned for continued growth, but like all of the major organizations working in artificial intelligence and cloud solutions, specific niches are integral to maintaining market share.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Oracle is a buy for me. Whether the company's annual stock returns will average at around 20% over the next decade is speculative, but the company is positioned operationally to have strong performance ahead. However, the balance sheet and competition risks, in particular, make me skeptical about allocating a large amount to the investment. I feel less confident investing in Oracle than I do in Microsoft and Google, yet the stock remains on my watchlist for when I next allocate to the technology section of my portfolio.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "The FTC’s inquiry into Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet’s AI alliances is the opening shot in a showdown that could reshape tech",
        "content": "Antitrust regulators may have been late to the game in regulating social media giants. But on Thursday they made it clear they don’t intend to make that same mistake with AI.\n\nSo far, the reaction has been a big shrug.\n\nThe FTC’s surprise announcement that it was examining the multi-billion dollar partnerships between Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet and generative AI startups OpenAI and Anthropic, was a direct shot at what many consider the future of the tech giants’ businesses. And yet shares of Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet all finished Thursday’s regular trading session in positive territory.\n\nWall Street’s muted reaction marked a curious start to what could become the biggest Silicon Valley versus DC showdown since the effort to break up Bill Gates’ Microsoft nearly three decades ago. But with society and business still coming to grips with generative AI’s power and its fast adoption, the usual script may not apply. As the FTC moves forward with its inquiry, the power of the government to control AI, while balancing it with the demands of the marketplace, will be put to the test.\n\n“Concentrated economic power has become a huge threat to democracy and human autonomy,” tweeted longtime Silicon Valley investor Roger McNamee on Thursday after the FTC announcement. “Big Tech is using AI to extend its power, despite insane misuse of water & energy, theft of IP, low ROI use cases,” he said.\n\nThe inquiry announced by the FTC is a somewhat unusual approach for the agency, which tends to combat anticompetitive behavior via probes and lawsuits against M&A deals. In the case of Anthropic and OpenAI, these companies are independent—even if they do boast multibillion dollar investments and have cloud giants with outsized standing on their cap tables. Microsoft has invested at least $13 billion into OpenAI, and owns a 49% stake in the company. In October, Google agreed to invest $2 billion in Anthropic, and Amazon agreed to invest up to $4 billion in the company the month prior.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it’s likely not just the size of these investments that has the FTC looking into these companies in particular, but the concentration. Even though AI companies have ignited interest from investors across the startup ecosystem, close to half of the capital being poured into generative AI—approximately 44% of it—is coming from six companies alone, according to PitchBook. The FTC is probing five of them, and the sixth is GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft. Most startups aren’t going to be able to raise the kind of capital needed to build out and operate these large language models. (The cost to train GPT-4 alone, for example, was more than $100 million).\n\n“It's natural that the FTC is engaging,” Pete Flint, general partner at the seed-stage venture capital firm NFX, tells Fortune in an email, noting that these kinds of investments may include potential conflicts or bundling opportunities around commercial contracts that would give tech company investors an edge.\n\nAs Fortune has reported, these kinds of deals have come with much more than just equity. In the case of Microsoft, OpenAI depends on Microsoft for its cloud computing data centers. OpenAI uses them to train and run its models.\n\nWhile it might make sense for the FTC to put its nose into these kinds of partnerships, it’s unclear whether the FTC will have any kind of success in doing so, as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google don’t control any of these companies themselves—and could bring all of their generative AI efforts in-house. Alphabet already has a long history of doing just that, having set up Google Brain in 2011, and then buying DeepMind a few years later.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella took on the issue at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, saying that Microsoft’s approach is less competitive than if they were to build out generative AI capabilities solely on their own. “If we want competition in AI against players who are vertically integrated, I think partnerships is one avenue of, in fact, having competition,” he said. In a statement to Fortune for this story, Microsoft’s corporate vice president Rima Alaily said that “the U.S. has assumed a global AI leadership position because important American companies are working together. Partnerships between independent companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, as well as among many others, are promoting competition and accelerating innovation.”\n\nBut regulatory interest in OpenAI, in particular, appears to be heightened after the temporary ouster of its CEO, Sam Altman, by the board last fall, when Microsoft swept in with an offer to bring on the OpenAI team as a subsidiary of Microsoft. After the debacle subsided and Altman returned to OpenAI as CEO, Microsoft took a board observer seat at the non-profit, which was pointed out in the Competition and Markets Authority’s preliminary investigation announcement it made shortly after. It’s unclear whether Altman’s termination had anything to do with the FTC’s inquiry. An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.\n\nOpenAI, Anthropic, and Amazon declined to comment for this story. A Google spokesperson said that the company hopes “the FTC’s study will shine a bright light on companies that don’t offer the openness of Google Cloud or have a long history of locking-in customers—and who are bringing that same approach to AI services.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. received inquiries from the US Federal Trade Commission on their investments and partnerships with artificial intelligence startups Anthropic and OpenAI, part of a study on how AI is impacting competition in the technology industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Sinks After Warning About ‘Notably Lower’ Growth Rate Putin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Sensing Advantage in War US GDP Grew 3.3% Last Quarter, Capping Unexpectedly Strong Year Microsoft Cuts 1,900 Jobs in Gaming, Including at Activision\n\nThe antitrust and consumer protection agency on Thursday said it sent subpoenas to the companies to gather information. The probe focuses on more than $19 billion in investments by Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet’s Google, a series of transactions that cemented alliances between the world’s cloud-services giants and the leading developers of artificial intelligence software.\n\nAntitrust enforcers across the world have become concerned as many of the most promising AI startups now depend heavily on the old guard of dominant tech companies for their financing and infrastructure needs.\n\nIn comments during a public workshop Thursday, FTC Chair Lina Khan said the agency is closely monitoring the industry and warned that AI companies “cannot use claims of innovation as cover for law breaking.”\n\n“There is no AI exemption from the laws on the books,” she said.\n\nGoogle said it doesn’t have exclusive rights to Anthropic’s technology, and its investment doesn’t include a board seat or voting rights.\n\n“We hope the FTC’s study will shine a bright light on companies that don’t offer the openness of Google Cloud,” said Peter Schottenfels, a company spokesperson.\n\nMicrosoft said the US is a leader in artificial intelligence because of collaborations between American companies.\n\n“Partnerships between independent companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, as well as among many others, are promoting competition and accelerating innovation,” said Rima Alaily, Microsoft’s top competition lawyer. “We look forward to providing the FTC with the information it needs to complete its study.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon and Anthropic declined to comment. OpenAI didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe inquiry comes as technology giants take a bigger role in backing nimble AI startups in a bid to stake a claim in the booming sector. Over the past year, Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around AI tools powered by OpenAI’s technology, while Google has said it plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into its experimental search tool sometime this year.\n\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The ouster and subsequent reinstatement of Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive officer, in November exposed how inextricably linked Microsoft and the company have become. Those ties have already spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, Google in October committed to back Anthropic with $2 billion, and Amazon last year also agreed to an investment of as much as $4 billion. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, who left that company amid differences over the direction of the business.\n\nRead More: Big Tech’s Massive AI Startup Deals, By the Numbers\n\nRebecca Kelly Slaughter, one of the FTC’s three Democrats, criticized the tech giants for structuring their transactions in a way designed to avoid the US merger law that would have required them to notify antitrust enforcers.\n\n“It’s reasonable to wonder whether these investments could lead to a heavily consolidated market dominated by only a few,” she said at the same workshop where Khan spoke.\n\nBut, she warned, “studying a market is a compliment to, and not a substitute for, appropriate enforcement.”\n\nMicrosoft didn’t report the OpenAI transaction to the agency because the investment doesn’t amount to control of the company under US law, Bloomberg has reported. OpenAI is also a nonprofit, and acquisitions of non-corporate entities aren’t reported under US merger law, regardless of value.\n\nIn the case of Google and Amazon, the deals were structured as convertible notes, a type of debt that will convert to equity at the startup’s next funding round. Those don’t require notification to the agency until they’re converted.\n\nThe FTC is conducting the inquiry under its so-called 6(b) authority that allows it to issue subpoenas to conduct market studies. The agency generally issues a report on its findings after analyzing the information from companies, though that process can take years to complete. The agency is still finalizing the results of studies on pharmaceutical middlemen and supply chains that it started in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAlthough the information is collected for research purposes, the FTC can use any details it gleans to open official investigations or aid in existing probes. Last summer, the agency opened an investigation into whether OpenAI has violated consumer protection laws with its popular ChatGPT conversational AI bot.\n\nThe FTC and its sister agency, the Justice Department, share jurisdiction over antitrust probes and have been debating internally which should take the lead on AI. The Justice Department has generally handled antitrust issues related to Microsoft since its blockbuster monopolization case against the Windows maker in the late 1990s. The FTC, however, recently handled Microsoft’s acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard Inc.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission is looking into some of the agreements that have been struck between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers. The EU’s executive arm is investigating the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority said in December that it also would probe Microsoft and OpenAI’s partnership.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary, Julia Love, Matt Day and Jackie Davalos.\n\n(Updates with Google and Microsoft statements beginning in sixth paragraph. An earlier version’s ninth paragraph was corrected to show that Amazon invested in Anthropic in 2023, not this year.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Goldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors Why Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Googleparent Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is up on Thursday. It resolved a patent lawsuit on Wednesday involving AI technology, with the claim amounting to an extraordinary $1.67 billion.\n\nSingular Computing, established by Massachusetts computer scientist Joseph Bates, initiated the lawsuit. The company accused Google of misusing its computer-processing solutions.\n\nGoogle has also partnered with Hugging Face, a startup specializing in AI software, to host its platform on Google’s cloud computing network.\n\nThis collaboration will allow Hugging Face to offer its platform through Google Cloud, significantly expanding developers’ access to the startup’s AI tools.\n\nThe Hugging Face partnership will likely accelerate innovation by enabling more developers to create AI applications using Hugging Face’s resources and Google Cloud’s computing capabilities and specialized hardware, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThis agreement bolsters Google’s relationship with the open-source AI community, a sector increasingly competitive with significant tech companies in developing cost-effective AI models.\n\nHugging Face, a New York-based company founded in 2016, has gained popularity for sharing open-source AI models.\n\nThrough this partnership, developers using Hugging Face will benefit from the technological resources of Google Cloud.\n\nHugging Face CEO Clement Delangue highlighted the partnership’s potential to enhance the capabilities of both Hugging Face users and Google Cloud customers.\n\nGoogle’s involvement in Hugging Face’s recent funding round, valued at $4.5 billion, further solidifies its collaborative efforts in the AI field.\n\nIn 2023, Google committed close to $2 billion to AI startup Anthropic after reports of Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) decided to earmark $4 billion.\n\nGoogle already integrated its Bard artificial intelligence chatbot with several popular products, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBig tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google, remain aggressively invested in their AI ambitions.

Those ties have spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union.\n\nMeanwhile, Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees, who left the company amid differences over the direction of the business. Alphabet’s Google in October committed to back it with $2 billion, and earlier this year Amazon agreed to an investment of as much as $4 billion.\n\nThe FTC is conducting the inquiry under its so-called 6(b) authority that allows it to issue subpoenas to conduct market studies. The agency generally issues a report on its findings after analyzing the information from companies, though that process can take years to complete. The agency is still finalizing the results of studies on pharmaceutical middlemen and supply chains that it started in 2021 and 2022.\n\nAlthough the information is collected for research purposes, the FTC can use any details it gleans to open official investigations or aid in existing probes. Last summer, the agency opened an investigation into whether OpenAI has violated consumer protection laws with its popular ChatGPT conversational AI bot.\n\nThe FTC and its sister agency, the Justice Department, share jurisdiction over antitrust probes and have been debating internally which should take the lead on the AI. The Justice Department has generally handled antitrust issues related to Microsoft since its blockbuster monopolization case against the Windows maker in the late 1990s. The FTC, however, recently handled Microsoft’s acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard Inc.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission is looking into some of the agreements that have been concluded between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers. The European Commission is investigating the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary, Julia Love, Matt Day and Jackie Davalos.\n\n(Updates with additional company comments in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround Goldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around Can America’s New Union Hero Take on Elon Musk’s Tesla?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), with its dividend yield of 3.5%, presents a compelling investment opportunity in the real estate sector, focusing on data center properties. This area of specialization is particularly relevant in today’s data-driven world, tapping into the relentless expansion of cloud computing and data storage needs. The increasing reliance on digital infrastructure, driven by technological advancements and a shift towards remote work and online services, positions Digital Realty Trust as a strategic choice for investors seeking consistent, growth-oriented returns.\n\nA noteworthy aspect of investing in Digital Realty Trust is its indirect linkage to the world's leading tech companies, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While Digital Realty’s client base is diverse, these tech giants are significant lessees, making an investment in Digital Realty a way to indirectly benefit from the tech sector’s rapid growth. This connection adds an exciting layer to Digital Realty's investment appeal – it's akin to earning dividends from the ongoing digital revolution and the dominance of cloud computing.\n\nDigital Realty Trust also offers an exciting way to earn dividends propelled by the AI revolution. The data centers managed by Digital Realty are fundamental in powering AI technologies for companies like Microsoft and Google. This makes investing in Digital Realty a unique means of benefiting from the AI surge. As AI continues to transform industries and drive technological innovation, the demand for data processing and storage, core services provided by Digital Realty, is expected to skyrocket. This positions Digital Realty Trust investors to potentially reap dividends that are indirectly fueled by the exponential growth of AI – a sector characterized by its high growth potential but not typically associated with dividend income. This unique angle of earning from AI’s advancement through Digital Realty’s dividends adds an extra layer of appeal for forward-thinking investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nInvestors often grapple with the choice between growth and income; typically, high-growth investments do not provide regular income, and dividend-paying stocks may lack substantial growth potential. However, Digital Realty Trust defies this convention. By focusing on data center real estate, crucial for the operation of cloud computing and internet services, Digital Realty is anchored in a fast-growing industry. Simultaneously, as a REIT, it is obligated to distribute most of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.\n\nDigital Realty owns and operates an extensive network of data centers in key locations worldwide, including major urban and technology hubs. This global presence is essential in mitigating risks associated with regional economic changes. The company's facilities, serving as vital nodes for data storage and cloud services, ensure a strong and diversified tenant base. The growing demand for data processing and storage underscores the sustained need for Digital Realty’s properties. During the third quarter of 2023, Digital Realty announced a dividend of $1.22 per share, with total dividends paid from January to September 2023 amounting to $3.66.\n\nInvesting in Digital Realty Trust is more than a real estate play; it’s a strategic move into the heart of the tech revolution. As cloud computing and data storage needs balloon, powered by relentless digital transformation, the role of Digital Realty’s properties becomes ever more vital, potentially boosting dividend prospects. This unique positioning makes Digital Realty an enticing option for those looking to diversify their portfolio with a taste of the booming tech sector.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

        "content": "SaskTel's Digital Mobile Brand Launches AI-Powered Virtual Agent for Enhanced Digital Customer Engagement\n\nLüm Mobile adopts Alepo's Virtual Agent for all-digital customer experience Replaced old generation chatbot with human-like chat experiences The vertically tuned and integrated LLM, harnessed by Alepo, is as accurate as an experienced human agent.\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Alepo proudly announces that Lüm Mobile, SaskTel's innovative all-digital mobile brand, has launched Lümbot, a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual agent from Alepo to deliver an all-digital customer support experience. AI generated artwork depicting the future of digital customer service using TelcoBot.ai Virtual Agent by Alepo\n\nLümbot, which lives on Lüm Mobile's website, harnesses the power of Generative AI to provide subscribers with an unparalleled level of interaction. Unlike traditional chatbots constrained by preset rules, Alepo's AI Virtual Agent is able to comprehend and engage in human-like customer service sessions through the use of Large Language Model (LLM). The AI Virtual Agent understands nuanced subscriber interaction and offers a high task completion rate, measured by a drastic reduction in escalations to human agents since it was soft launched late last year.\n\nLümbot is designed to handle a wide range of inputs and can understand context, resulting in dynamic and evolving conversations. By continuously learning and improving over time through access to more data, Lümbot is fine-tuned for specific tasks, making it more proficient in understanding human-like language. Lümbot excels in maintaining context in conversation and using backend IT system to complete tasks on behalf of customers. Going beyond standard virtual agents, Lümbot intelligently adapts personas in real time based on session context, offering a tailored experience for each user.\n\nCharlene Gavel, SaskTel President and CEO, commented, \"With the introduction of Lümbot, we are taking a big leap forward in our digital journey, employing generative AI and LLM technology to enable a holistic, end-to-end digital customer service experience.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSunil Diaz, Alepo CEO, stated: \"Alepo is proud to partner with Lüm Mobile in delivering an AI-driven solution that not only enhances its digital brand but also boosts subscriber growth rates while effectively managing customer acquisition costs.\"\n\nGenerative AI, a promising technology pioneered by OpenAI, Microsoft and Alphabet, has seen slower than expected adoption in digital customer service mainly due to the inaccuracy risk inherent with Large Language Models, often referred to as 'hallucinations.' \"Through vertical fine tuning and prompt engineering, we were able to reduce error rates to below human agent levels, while increasing task completion rates, through automated IT system integration. This is the TelcoBot.ai secret sauce\", added Diaz.\n\nAs more vertically specialized Generative AI integrators, like Alepo, are able to solve the hallucination problem the adoption of generative AI customer service is expected to accelerate, disrupting traditional customer service tools and processes.\n\nThe TelcoBot.ai Virtual Agent is able to switch between Customer Service and Sales personas, solve customer problems, answer queries, sell upgrades, provide relevant information for prospects, all while providing an accurate, enjoyable, frustration-free, chat experience.\n\n\"Digital Customer Engagement is being reinvented by Alepo. The days of rigid chatbots and frustrating IVRs are over.\" concluded Diaz.\n\nLümbot is positioned to drive wireless subscriber take-up rates for Lüm Mobile by delivering an unparalleled digital experience. The AI virtual agent platform aims to make it easier and more enticing for customers to acquire services, ultimately boosting subscriber satisfaction. Lüm Mobile and Alepo look forward to the positive impact Lümbot will have on customer interactions and anticipate it becoming an integral part of the innovative services provided to subscribers.\n\nFor more details on the Lümbot project, see the case study here.\n\nAbout SaskTel\n\nSaskTel is the leading Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provider in Saskatchewan, with approximately $1.3 billion in annual revenue and nearly 1.4 million customer connections including more than 654,000 wireless accesses, 257,000 wireline network accesses, 295,000 internet and data accesses, 111,000 maxTV service subscribers, and 77,000 security monitoring customers.

        "content": "Microsoft’s MSFT second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, scheduled to be reported on Jan 30, are likely to be driven by the consistent growth in its cloud platform, Azure.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft expects Intelligent Cloud revenues (Azure falls under the segment) between $21.5 billion and $25.4 billion.\r\n\r\nOur model estimate for Intelligent Cloud revenues is currently pegged at $25.11 billion, indicating 16.8% growth from that reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Microsoft Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-eps-surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nContinued Growth in Azure to Drive the Top Line\n\nMicrosoft is benefiting from continued demand for cloud infrastructure monitoring, web-based application performance management and human capital management solutions, fueled by the increasing migration of workloads to the cloud.\r\n\r\nIn Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth in the range of 26-27% at cc, with increasing contributions from all Azure AI services.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Azure’s year-over-year top-line growth rate of 29% (up 28% at cc) was higher than 26% (up 27% at cc) reported in the previous quarter. The growth continues to be driven by Azure consumption-based business and the company expects the trends from the fiscal first quarter to continue into the second quarter. Microsoft’s per-user business should continue to benefit from momentum in the Microsoft 365 suite.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is also witnessing increasing momentum with Azure Arc, which now has 21,000 customers, up 140% year over year, including Carnival Corp., Domino’s and Thermo Fisher. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAzure’s increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally is expected to have strengthened Microsoft’s competitive position in the cloud computing market, dominated by Amazon’s AMZN division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS\") and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, AWS revenues (16.1% of sales) rose 12.3% year over year to $23.06 billion. AWS’ operating income was $6.98 billion, up 29.1% year over year. The expansion of its AWS portfolio has been helping Amazon to maintain its dominance in the cloud domain by gaining more customers.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s Google Cloud revenues rose 22.5% year over year to $8.41 billion, accounting for 10.9% of the quarter’s total revenues. Google Cloud reported operating income of $266 million compared with a loss of $440 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Leads Generative AI Race With Azure AI\n\nAzure AI provides access to best-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including the company’s own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build their own AI apps while meeting specific cost, latency and performance needs.\r\n\r\nAs OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider, Azure powers all of its workloads. More than 18,000 organizations, including Ikea, Volvo, Flipkart and Humane, now use Azure OpenAI Service.\r\n\r\nThe launch of enterprise capabilities of Azure OpenAI and Copilots across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is expected to be a game changer.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, Microsoft announced partnering with Meta Platforms to provide customers with more choice and security as they venture into the metaverse. MSFT is bringing Mesh for Microsoft Teams to Meta Quest devices. Mesh for Teams with Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 2 devices will enable people to connect and collaborate as though they are together in person.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Microsoft 365 apps will be available on Meta Quest devices, enabling people to interact with content from their favorite productivity apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and SharePoint within VR.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, Siemens SIEGY and Microsoft announced a new strategic partnership to drive cross-industry AI adoption. The companies are introducing Siemens Industrial Copilot, an AI-powered assistant aimed at improving human-machine collaboration in manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the launch of the integration between Siemens Teamcenter software for product lifecycle management and Microsoft Teams will further pave the way to enabling the industrial metaverse. It will simplify the virtual collaboration of design engineers, frontline workers and other teams across business functions.\r\n\r\nNew Azure AI Studio is becoming the tool of choice for AI development in this new era, helping organizations ground, fine-tune, evaluate and deploy models, and do so responsibly.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan 30.\r\n\r\nFor the quarter under review, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $70.71 billion, indicating an improvement of 12% from the year-ago reported number.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.60, indicating 52.4% growth from the previous year’s reported figure. The figure has been stable over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nThe company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in the remaining one, delivering an earnings surprise of 4.62%, on average.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Alphabet Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nSearch, YouTube & Ad Efforts to Consider\n\nThe company’s continued efforts toward innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the advancement of its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are expected to have driven traffic on its platform in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe integration of generative AI technology into the search engine might have continued to benefit Google Search. With the large language models (LLM)-powered enhanced search results, GOOGL is likely to have driven its search momentum in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nBard’s integration might have been a major positive for the company's search platform. Assistant with Bard, which aids in generating better AI-backed search results, is likely to have boosted the search traffic further.\r\n\r\nThe Search Generative Experience (SGE), which leverages generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is likely to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nThis, along with strength across Google Lens and Google Maps, is expected to have contributed well to the fourth quarter’s Search performance.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Search & Other revenues is pegged at $47.84 billion, indicating an increase of 12.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nComing to the advertisement business, Alphabet’s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are expected to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nSGE is expected to have aided the advertisement business as it can create relevant, customized and high-quality ads.\r\n\r\nStabilization in advertisers’ spending is expected to have benefited the advertising business. The strength in conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is likely to have driven the company’s momentum among advertisers during the fourth quarter. The improving performance of YouTube ads might have been another positive.\r\n\r\nHowever, softness in Network advertising might have been a major concern.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for Google advertising is pegged at $65.45 billion, suggesting growth of 10.8% from the reported figure in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nComing to the non-advertisement revenues of YouTube, strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts might have been a tailwind. Google’s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are likely to have acted as a positive.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of major updates and various user-friendly features of YouTube Premium is likely to have bolstered the Premium subscriber base in the quarter under review. Also, solid momentum in Connected TV might have been a plus.\r\n\r\nThese factors might have driven growth in Google’s Other revenues, for which the consensus mark is pinned at $9.65 billion, indicating growth of 9.7% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe growing momentum across Android 14 is likely to have benefited Alphabet’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAll the abovementioned factors are expected to have benefited Google’s Services segment’s performance in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Services revenues is pegged at $74.95 billion, suggesting growth of 10.5% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrength in Cloud & Other Bets to Benefit\n\nAlphabet’s go-to-market strategy, expanding cloud service portfolio and strengthening cloud infrastructure, including data centers and cloud regions, is expected to have benefited Google Cloud’s fourth-quarter performance.\r\n\r\nThe solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is likely to have contributed well to the performance of the Google Cloud segment in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud revenues is pinned at $9.04 billion, indicating growth of 23.6% from the reported figure in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s strengthening efforts toward bolstering its healthcare technology portfolio are expected to have driven growth in its Other Bets segment during the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other Bets revenues is pegged at $251 million, indicating growth of 31.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Alphabet this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is the case here, as you will see below.\r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +2.26%.

        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alphabet (GOOGL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAlphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 30 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOGL Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GOOGL\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Alphabet, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAlphabet Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 30 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOG Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GOOG\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alphabet Inc. here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Alphabet Inc., but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in GOOG?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet Inc., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.77.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet Inc.

        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Alphabet (GOOGL) will announce quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 52.4% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $70.71 billion, increasing 12% from the same quarter last year.\n\nOver the last 30 days, there has been a downward revision of 0.5% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Alphabet metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenue- Google properties' to come in at $57.02 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +12.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenue- Google Cloud' reaching $9.04 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +23.6% year over year.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- YouTube ads' of $9.10 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +14.3%.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenue- Google Advertising- Total' will reach $65.45 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +10.9% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- Google Search & other' will reach $47.84 billion. The estimate points to a change of +12.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenue- Google Network' stands at $8.52 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +0.5% year over year.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenue- EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa)' will likely reach $24.76 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +13.8% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- US- Total' should arrive at $40.09 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8.4%.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenue- Other Americas (Canada and Latin America)' will reach $5.16 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenue- APAC (Asia-Pacific)' to reach $13.82 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +15.3% year over year.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Total traffic acquisition costs' should come in at $13.95 billion. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $12.93 billion in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Headcount' at 182,484. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 190,234.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Alphabet here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of Alphabet have experienced a change of +5.9% in the past month compared to the +2.5% move of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

        "title": "Google Cloud partners with Hugging Face to attract AI developers",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - The cloud computing arm of Alphabet Inc said on Thursday it had formed a partnership with startup Hugging Face to ease artificial intelligence (AI) software development in the company's Google Cloud.\n\nFollowing the launch of generative AI tools focused on consumers from the likes of Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet, large and small businesses have become interested in deploying AI for their own purposes - such as boosting an existing product or serving an internal need. The need to create AI software that is optimized for specific tasks and needs prompted the partnership.\n\n\"It shows we are moving into a world where there's not just one model, but there as many models as companies, Hugging Face Chief Executive Clem Delangue told Reuters in an interview. \"Every company is training, fine tuning and optimizing their own models, which is the direction that the field is taking.\"\n\nRampaging demand for cloud-based AI computing suggests that at its current trajectory it will overtake the traditional cloud software market in the future, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said.\n\n\"It always starts infrastructure up because you first got to put in the machines that reflect the demand - and grow from there,\" Kurian said.\n\nThe companies reached a revenue-sharing agreement, but did not disclose the terms.\n\nThe arrangement will allow developers using Google Cloud's technical infrastructure to access and deploy Hugging Face's repository of open source AI software, such as models and data sets. Hugging Face has grown into a central hub for open-source AI software, and signed a similar arrangement in February last year with Amazon.com's cloud unit.\n\nThe partnership coalesced because cloud customers have become more interested in modifying or building their own AI models versus using off-the-shelf options, Kurian said. One such example is ensuring against specific safety frameworks in place to secure against data leakage, or evaluate the quality of the model running.\n\nStory continues\n\nReflecting the amount of interest in building AI software, the New York-based Hugging Face's repository of AI-related software will roughly double in size in the next four months, when it previously took four years to reach its current state, Delangue said.\n\nDevelopers will be able to use an advanced version of Google's in-house built AI chips, or tensor processing units. And Google will complete the technical integration required to use Nvidia's coveted advanced AI chips, the H100, within \"weeks\" not \"months,\" Kurian said.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Apple (AAPL) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.13 a share, just seven days from its upcoming earnings release on February 1, 2024.\n\nApple's Earnings ESP sits at 1.96%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.13 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09.\n\nAAPL is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Alphabet (GOOGL) as well.\n\nAlphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on January 30, 2024. GOOGL's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.64 a share five days from its next earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Alphabet, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60 is 2.26%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, AAPL and GOOGL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

That paves the way for more developers to tap the startup’s tools, which they use to build their own AI applications, and potentially speed up the pace of innovation.\n\nFor Google, the agreement strengthens its ties with the open source AI community, where engineers are developing models that can rival those of big tech companies — at a lower cost. Last year, a Google engineer made waves with a manifesto asserting that the tech giant risked losing its edge in AI to open source developers.\n\nFounded in 2016, New York-based Hugging Face has emerged as a popular destination for sharing open source AI models. As a result of the partnership, developers on Hugging Face’s platform will be able to use Google Cloud’s computing power and specialized chips for models and other generative AI products.\n\n“With this new partnership, we will make it easy for Hugging Face users and Google Cloud customers to leverage the latest open models together,” Hugging Face Chief Executive Officer Clement Delangue said in the statement.\n\nGoogle participated in Hugging Face’s last funding round, which valued the startup at $4.5 billion.\n\n--With assistance from Rachel Metz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the West’s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa’s Most Dramatic Turnaround Goldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors Can America’s New Union Hero Take on Elon Musk’s Tesla?

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Stocks to Buy at a Discount Now.\n\nDespite the Dow hitting an all-time high earlier this month and many technology stocks like Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) extending their gains from the past year, several analysts believe the stock market has a lot of room to run. Possible rate cuts is one of the reasons behind this optimism.\n\nBank of America's analyst Michael Hartnett earlier this month said in his note that this is still a buy the dip market as he believes the market is still pricing in 140 bps of rate cuts from the Fed this year and the first half of 2024 upside is \"bigger than downside.\"\n\nIf executed smartly, the strategy involving buying stocks on the dip has proven to post higher returns in the past. A 2018 report by S&P Global took a look at the efficiency of the ‘Buy the Dip’ strategy by analyzing historical returns. The report said that between 2002 and 2017, buying stocks that lost about 10% or more relative to the broader market index, during a single day, significantly outperformed the index. The report said that individual stock declines are usually triggered by weak earnings reports or disappointing guidance chances. But'Buy the Dip' strategy, according to the report, is still profitable when we exclude the effect of these events and short-term news. Stocks to Buy at a Discount Now\n\nPhoto by Marga Santoso on UnsplashMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with PE ratios less than 15 and year-to-date stock price decline of 5% and above through January 16. From these stocks we selected 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nStory continues\n\n12. Cenovus Energy Inc (NYSE:CVE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nCenovus Energy Inc (NYSE:CVE) ranks 12th in our list of the stocks to buy at a discount now according to hedge funds.

(NYSE:CVE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) (Long +23%) shares rallied as WTI oil prices rose to ~US$91/bbl over the month, the highest level since November 2022. The company also had tailwinds from higher refinery margins, particularly in North America which remains their key exposure. Cenovus continues to generate strong free cash flow at current oil price levels, with the long-life nature of its oil sands assets and its low cost of production providing a break-even oil price at around ~US$40/bbl. We estimate the company can reach its net debt target in early CY24, enabling a step-up in shareholder returns through on-market share buybacks.”\n\n11. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) shares are down by about 5.7% year to date through January 16.

The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) during this period was Panayotis Takis Sparaggis's Alkeon Capital Management which owns a $332 million stake in Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).\n\nEarlier this month, UBS published a report listing stocks for the next five years and labeled them as \"Enabling Tech\" companies. Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) made it to the list as UBS praised Baidu Inc's (NASDAQ:BIDU) valuation and said its non-tech business could be its long-term catalyst.\n\nAriel Global Fund made the following comment about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“By comparison, after a strong run last quarter, China’s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) declined alongside a correction in Chinese stocks attributed to weak gross domestic product. We believe this price action runs counter to the company’s solid business fundamentals. Baidu delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat in the period, driven by a recovery in ad and cloud revenues. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is launching a generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI’s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China’s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”\n\n9.

        "content": "Varonis Systems VRNS and Microsoft MSFT have collaborated to improve Microsoft 365 data security posture so that their joint customers can safely use artificial intelligence (AI) tools. This collaboration is set to integrate the Varonis Data Security Platform in Microsoft 365.\n\nThe platform is aimed at improving the security posture while deploying MSFT’s Copilot for Microsoft 365. The Data Security Platform enables security teams to locate and classify normal and AI-generated data, implement least-privilege access controls and prevent data loss by using Microsoft Purview Information Protection labels. Moreover, it allows the team to monitor the data activity and behavior while uncovering archived data.\n\nBusinesses can now access the Varonis Platform on Azure Marketplace. The joint effort will ensure continuous evaluation and improvement of data security before, during and after deploying MSFT’s Copilot for Microsoft 365.\n\nVaronis Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus Varonis Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nVaronis Systems, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Varonis Systems, Inc. Quote\n\nMicrosoft’s existing security model relies on a user's pre-set permissions to determine which files, emails, chats and notes can be used to generate AI responses. The Varonis platform offers enterprises additional options over the existing security model while deploying Copilot for Microsoft 365.\n\nGrowing Through Partnerships\n\nBeing a cybersecurity company, Varonis Systems has been deploying cybersecurity solutions for a number of industry leaders. Alongside Microsoft, the company has rolled out solutions for Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, Salesforce CRM and Amazon in the past year.\n\nVaronis Systems has deployed the least privilege automation for Microsoft 365, Google Drive and Box. The solution, introduced in January 2023, was focused on continuously removing unnecessary data risk without human intervention.\n\nWith the use of Varonis Least Privilege access, organizations using Alphabet’s Google Drive can identify the risk-prone data pathway. On the identification of a potential data breach, the solution automatically revokes access.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn September 2023, Varonis Systems announced a stronger integration with Salesforce combining the prior's capabilities with Salesforce Shield. In this collaboration, VRNS collected important activity data from Salesforce Shield and compared it with the company's unique metadata. The partnership enhances threat detection and investigation capabilities.\n\nThe collaborations with these industry giants provide market exposure and knowledge transfer opportunities for Varonis Systems while stabilizing its revenues. Nevertheless, the company confronts additional hurdles, including intensified deal scrutiny, prolonged sales cycles and the complexities posed by a challenging macroeconomic landscape, all of which contribute to its current softened position.\n\nCurrently, Varonis Systems has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and MSFT carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Alphabet and Salesforce carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each at present. Shares of VRNS, MSFT, GOOGL and CRM have rallied 76.9%, 64.8, 50.5% and 78.7%, respectively, over the past year.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.’s Ring home doorbell unit says it will stop letting police departments request footage from users’ video doorbells and surveillance cameras, retreating from a practice that was criticized by civil liberties groups and some elected officials.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Says Ukraine Downed Plane Carrying Prisoners for Swap Trump Races Toward 2024 Biden Rematch After New Hampshire Win Apple Dials Back Car’s Self-Driving Features and Delays Launch to 2028 Billionaire Joe Lewis Pleads Guilty in Insider Trading Case China Boosts Stimulus by Allowing Banks to Keep Smaller Reserves\n\nNext week, the company will disable its Request For Assistance tool, the program that had allowed law enforcement to seek footage from users on a voluntary basis, Eric Kuhn, who runs Ring’s Neighbors app, said in a blog post on Wednesday. Police and fire departments will have to seek a warrant to request footage from users or show the company evidence of an ongoing emergency.\n\nKuhn didn’t say why Ring was disabling the tool. Yassi Yarger, a spokesperson, said Ring had decided to devote its resources to new products and experiences in the Neighbors app that better fit with the company’s vision. The aim is to make Neighbors, which had been focused on crime and safety, into more of a community hub, she said. New features announced on Wednesday – one called Ring Moments that lets users post clips and a company-produced Best of Ring – highlight that push.\n\nThe move marks a course change for Ring, which from its startup days through its years as part of Amazon couched its mission almost exclusively as an effort to improve public safety through surveillance. “Our mission to reduce crime in neighborhoods has been at the core of everything we do at Ring,” founding chief Jamie Siminoff said when Amazon sealed the acquisition of his company in 2018.\n\nAmazon joins Google in paring back law-enforcement access to its users. The Alphabet Inc.-owned company last month said it was changing its location history feature on Google Maps, eliminating the ability of police to request data on everyone in the vicinity of a crime. Grabbing user data from Google had become an increasingly popular route for police departments, a Bloomberg investigation found.\n\nStory continues\n\nCivil liberties groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have long criticized Ring, accusing it of building a residential surveillance network available on demand to law enforcement and highlighting the history of biased policing in the US.\n\n“This is a step in the right direction but has come after years of cozy relationships with police and irresponsible handling of data,” said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst with EFF. Amazon last year agreed to pay $5.8 million to settle a complaint brought by the US Federal Trade Commission accusing Ring of privacy and data security lapses.\n\nGuariglia said in an email that he was skeptical that Ring and law enforcement could correctly assess what constitutes an emergency situation, and noted that police could still seek Ring footage without a warrant by knocking on someone’s door.\n\nInitially, when police departments sought footage from Ring doorbell owners in a particular area during an investigation, the company would email users and ask them to voluntarily share clips. Ring in 2021 began requiring police and fire departments to make those requests publicly through its Neighbors app, a Nextdoor-like hub that lets people upload footage and share information. That didn’t defuse the critiques, including from Senator Ed Markey, who lambasted the “growing web of surveillance systems” built by Amazon and other technology firms.\n\nSiminoff left Ring last year. He was replaced as chief executive officer by Liz Hamren, who had worked at Discord Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. Hamren told Bloomberg last year that Ring was rethinking its mission statement, in part to account for its expanded portfolio of devices, which include indoor and backyard home monitoring and business services.\n\n(Updates with comment from civil liberties group, FTC privacy settlement, beginning in the seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors Hong Kong’s High Rents Create a New Type of Cross-Border Commuter It’s the Tesla Earnings Call—Time for Elon Musk Bingo Can America’s New Union Hero Take on Elon Musk’s Tesla?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) announced on Wednesday that it is teaming up with some of the biggest names in tech to launch the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot program.\n\nThe NAIRR pilot, the NSF said, is designed to create a national resource for researchers and educators to access high-powered AI technologies with the goal of ensuring the US continues to lead in AI research and innovation.\n\nCompanies and nonprofits joining in the two-year pilot program consist of a murderers' row of some of the biggest names in AI, including Amazon (AMZN), Anthropic, Hugging Face, IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), OpenAI, and Palantir (PLTR), among others.\n\nFederal agencies participating in the effort include the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Agriculture.\n\nNAIRR, which was born out of President Biden’s AI executive order, will serve as a framework for how the government and private sector can advance AI technologies in the future. Nvidia is among a collection of companies providing the National Science Foundation with help for its National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource, or NAIRR, program. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“By investing in AI research through the NAIRR pilot, the United States unleashes discovery and impact and bolsters its global competitiveness,” NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan said in a statement.\n\n“To continue leading in AI research and development, we must create opportunities across the country to advance AI innovation and strengthen educational opportunities, empowering the nation to shape international standards and igniting economic growth,” he added.\n\nAccording to the NSF, NAIRR will function as a shared national infrastructure that will provide communities across the country with the hardware, models, and resources needed to advance the AI ecosystem.\n\nThe program, the NSF said, is necessary because AI resources have become concentrated and difficult to access for many communities, whether those are smaller colleges or institutions in rural areas and territories.\n\nStory continues Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nExamples of potential use cases include allowing an AI researcher to investigate the validation and verification of large models or a lecturer from a community college or minority institution to provide students access to AI systems.\n\nTech companies, the foundation explained, aren’t being paid to provide access to their services, but rather are making in-kind contributions to those made by government agencies.\n\nContributions include support for 20 research projects by Amazon, access to Anthropic’s Claude model for 10 researchers working on climate change projects, 100 compute grants from Hugging Face, datasets and benchmarks from IBM, $20 million in compute credits for Microsoft’s Azure, and $30 million in support from Nvidia, including $24 million worth of computing for the company’s DGX platform.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "A recent string of bad news has done nothing so far to harm the stock of Google parent company AlphabetInc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has been on a tear to start the new year while riding the broader tech-focused rally.\n\nTwo senior scientists from DeepMind Technologies Ltd., an artificial intelligence (AI)-focused subsidiary of Alphabet, announced they were leaving the company to form their own startup. Rumors are that the scientists forming their new company are in talks to have a financing round of around $217 million to help build their AI model.\n\nThis isn't the first time researchers from DeepMind left Alphabet to raise huge amounts of money on their own. An early-stage company called Mistral AI shared last month that it recently raised about $420 million in its second funding round in just seven months.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nFunders on this alternative asset platform are earning more than 14% annualized consignment profit funding Pro consignment opportunities. This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch? Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\n\nWhile the scientists are leaving on their terms, many Google employees were not so lucky, as Google recently let go over 1,000 people. Worse yet, Google CEO Sundar Pichai circulated a memo to the company to expect more layoffs to come.\n\nSundar described \"ambitious goals\" where Google will be \"investing in our big priorities this year.\" Most likely, these ambitious goals refer to AI.\n\nOne can only speculate why the scientists are leaving, but it does not speak well to belief in Google's ability to continue innovating compared to cutting costs to drive profits. These leading AI scientists can work anywhere — not just Microsoft Corp.'s OpenAI, but also on their own ideas with outside funding.\n\nIt's funding that might have been incubated in Google's own Moonshot Factory, formally called X Development. This is the same division that formed the self-driving car startup, Waymo.\n\nStory continues\n\nPosts by both current and former employees have publicly blasted the culture for lacking the ability to continue innovating.\n\nGoogle employee Diane Hirsh Theriault wrote a scathing summary of the leadership on her LinkedIn page, saying, \"From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.\"\n\nNot only are there hints of a deteriorating culture, but recent product launches have also been marred in controversy.\n\nTrending: Copy and paste Mark Cuban’s startup investment strategyaccording to his colorful portfolio.\n\nConsider just before the end of the year when Google unveiled its largest and most capable AI model called Gemini. Taken at face value, the six-minute video demo was impressive. Gemini made tasks such as voicing aloud its description of a drawing of a duck seamless, showcasing its ability even to know the difference between visual pictures and physical objects.\n\nHowever, it soon became clear that the demo was not conducted in real-time, which is significant given the unknown length of time to get Gemini production-ready. This misleading launch followed a similar disappointing demo when Google unveiled Bard to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which employees called \"rushed\" and \"botched.\" In that demo, Bard outputted incorrect information.\n\nPerhaps no other company needs to succeed more in the AI race than Google, which is at risk of its core Search business being disrupted — a division that generated 57% of its revenue in 2022.\n\nWhile cutting costs can drive profits in the short term for Google, investors would be wise to consider whether Google will be able to make the necessary changes and innovations to compete in a drastically changing landscape.\n\nLosing key employees and public confusion from misleading demos are not the positive developments investors might have hoped for, but regardless, there have been no signs of the stock slowing down.\n\nMany of these engineers have seen continued success after leaving the search engine giant. Artificial intelligence is the most funded category by venture capitalists, and many founders from big tech companies have gone on to raise billions.\n\nEven retail investors have begun pouring millions into artificial intelligence startups. On StartEngine, a leading equity crowdfunding portal, six companies are raising in the AI category, with WiGL Inc. leading those with over $7 million raised from more than 4,600 investors.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAverage retirement income in America has been revealed – Will you make enough each month?

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is leaving no stone unturned to enhance its Android offerings, which have been one of the key growth drivers of the company. Alphabet’s shares have gained 54.4% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 46.6%.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Google recently announced that the “Photo Stacks” feature of Google Photos is now getting added to Android.\r\n\r\nThe feature automatically groups similar photos within a short time frame, resulting in one image in the main grid. This is indicated by a number and icon in the Photos tab.\r\n\r\nFurther, this grouping feature displays images in a carousel, with options to set top picks, remove photos, or keep some but delete others to clean up the library.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid traction across Android users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Google Photos Capabilities on Android\n\nApart from the Photo Stacks feature, Google introduced a system-wide photo picker in Android 13, allowing apps to import photos without requiring permission to view the user's library, a method adopted by some apps.\r\n\r\nAlphabet also updated Google Photos capabilities on Android by introducing an AI-powered \"Highlight videos\" feature for Android users, replacing the previous \"Movie\" maker functionality. The new \"plus\" icon opens a \"Create new\" sheet, allowing users to create albums, collages, cinematic photos and animations.\r\n\r\nThe company also added another Google Photos feature in Android 14, which allows developers to create share sheets with app-specific actions, replacing Google Photos' custom implementation with a native one. The \"Sharing image\" sheet slides up, allowing users to select more images and use the Markup tool.\n\nStrength in Google Services Segment\n\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will bolster the company’s Android offerings, which, in turn, will strengthen its Google Services segment, which constitutes the majority of the total revenues.\r\n\r\nNotably, Alphabet revamped its Android bookmarks page for Google Chrome, featuring larger image previews for saved links and folders and displaying blue folders for core bookmarks and available image previews.\r\n\r\nThe company also added new features to its Google Messages app, including a \"plus\" shortcut, offering Android users a redesign, including a left-facing compose field and an emoji shortcut, along with Magic Compose, a new Gallery icon and a plus menu at the right.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s growing endeavors to strengthen Google Services offerings are expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, which has risen by 5 cents in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET, Apple AAPL and Itron ITRI, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nArista Networks shares have returned 115.2% over the past year.

        "title": "Why tech layoffs aren't yet a sign of a labor market slowdown",
        "content": "More than a dozen companies have conducted layoffs since the start of the year.\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) trimmed a small part of its staff on Monday, for instance. And on the same day, Amazon (AMZN) slashed workers from its Buy with Prime unit, marking the latest in a trend of cuts across major companies to start the new year.\n\nBut economists don't see these job cuts as a firm sign the labor market is headed for an outright downturn. So far, that is.\n\n\"What you see in the news in terms of companies announcing layoffs and what you see in the economic data are not necessarily the same thing,\" explained Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro.\n\nIn other words, the bark of headlines about layoffs may simply be harsher than the actual bite.\n\nCase in point: The most recent reading of weekly unemployment claims showed the lowest number of filings since September 2022. The consistency of this weekly data has been crucial for economists searching for signs of cooling in the labor market.\n\nDutta noted that the layoffs right now aren't \"particularly widespread\" and the amount of workers cut appears to be smaller than the tech layoffs seen at the start of 2023.\n\nJefferies US economist Thomas Simons said companies announcing layoffs — and actually making the move — don't always happen at the same time. They can show up with a lag in the data, or not at all, depending on how significant the layoffs are.\n\nAlso, given the strength of the economy, Simons added, Americans might not be rushing to file for benefits. A consistently low unemployment rate could give laid-off workers confidence that they can get hired again quickly.\n\n\"Reassuringly, the job-finding probability of unemployed workers remains in line with its pre-pandemic level, suggesting that the labor market remains strong and job opportunities remain plentiful,\" a Goldman Sachs team of economists wrote in a research note to clients on Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimons also highlighted that higher-than-average wage growth in recent years — and households coming from a stronger financial position than at other comparable times in history — could support Americans when they are let go from a job. \"There's probably a good number of people in this sort of middle or upper middle class who get laid off from a job and just won't bother to file for unemployment insurance,\" Simons told Yahoo Finance. \"It may not be worth it to them.\"\n\n\"There isn't a lot of worry. If [layoffs] start to kick up,\" he added, \"we might see ... catch-up unemployment filings. For now, it's kind of a different.\"\n\nIndeed, the latest projections from the economics team at Goldman Sachs, which doesn't believe the US will enter a recession in 2024, show economic growth of at least 2.2% in each of the first two quarters of this year.\n\nTo Dutta at Renaissance Macro, this is the key to why the economic data may never catch up to the headlines. Economic growth stimulates further job growth, Dutta said.\n\n\"If the economy is growing, it's hard to see that much in terms of labor market weakness,\" Dutta said.\n\nThe last shoe?\n\nThere are signs of slowing in the labor market that worry some economists.\n\nFor instance, Deutsche Bank senior economist Brett Ryan — whose firm still predicts a mild recession in the first part of 2024 — said that while the layoffs aren't yet in data, there are other labor market indicators signaling a cooling off.\n\nFor one, job growth as a whole has narrowed. Deutsche Bank's research reveals that gains in two sectors — leisure as well as private health and education — account for 95% of the private payroll gains in the last six months. The narrow breadth could project slowing growth moving forward as those sectors reach a post-pandemic balance.\n\nThat potential slowdown, combined with a declining hiring rate, makes weekly jobless claims, or other metrics that measure layoffs, the \"shoe that hasn't dropped yet,\" said Ryan.\n\n\"Firms are reluctant to lay off employees because of the sort of scarring experience of having to rehire them after the pandemic,\" Ryan said. \"But the question is, how long can it last?\" Scary layoffs?

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Sri Lanka passes new law to regulate online content",
        "content": "(Recasts after parliament passes bill, adds result in para 6, fresh quotes throughout)\n\nBy Uditha Jayasinghe\n\nCOLOMBO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill to regulate online content, the speaker of the parliament announced, a law which opposition politicians and activists allege will muzzle free speech.\n\nThe Online Safety Bill proposes jail terms for content that a five-member commission considers illegal and making social media platforms such as Alphabet's Google, Meta's Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, liable for such content on their platforms.\n\nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe's government says the bill is aimed at battling cyber crime including child abuse, data theft and online fraud.\n\n\"Sri Lanka had 8,000 cyber crimes complaints last year. We all agree that we need laws to address these issues. This is why we are bringing this law,\" Public Security Minister Tiran Alles said on Tuesday while introducing the bill in the house.\n\n\"It is not to suppress the media or the opposition...Any complaint will be taken up by the commission, who will be appointed by the president and they will decide how to act.\"\n\nThe bill was passed with a majority of 46 votes in the 225-member house, the speaker announced. 108 votes were in favour while 62 members voted against it.\n\nThe Asian Internet Coalition (AIC), which has Apple , Amazon, Google and Yahoo as members, warned Sri Lanka that the bill could impact investment in the country's IT industry and called for extensive amendments to it.\n\n\"We unequivocally stand by our position that the Online Safety Bill, in its current form, is unworkable and would undermine potential growth and foreign direct investment into Sri Lanka's digital economy,\" the AIC said in a statement.\n\nLast year, the United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) said the law \"could potentially criminalise nearly all forms of legitimate expression\" while New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it would \"seriously threaten\" the right to freedom of expression in the country.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Sri Lanka has engaged with AIC and consulted with stakeholders since November. We are open to considering fresh changes and bringing them as amendments to the legislation at a later date,\" Alles said before the debate on the bill concluded on Wednesday and voting was called.\n\nA small group of activists and opposition members protested against the legislation outside parliament.\n\nHarsha de Silva, a lawmaker of Sri Lanka's main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya, told parliament that it was not right to hold social media platforms accountable.\n\n\"This legislation is a threat to our democracy,\" he said. \"This will have a severe negative impact on expanding e-commerce in Sri Lanka, to provide jobs to our youth and help our economy, which is in desperate need of growth.\" (Reporting by Uditha Jayasinghe; Writing by Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Kirsten Donovan)",

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) was a hot market last year, and that trend is expected to continue in 2024. Forecasts indicate the AI industry will skyrocket from $207.9 billion in 2023 to nearly $2 trillion by 2030.\n\nBut just because an organization uses AI doesn't mean it can deliver multiple years of results. To find stocks with long-term potential, invest in companies with track records of success with it.\n\nHere are three such companies to consider: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Not only has each achieved impressive results with AI, but they also operate in different industries, providing you with a diversified portfolio. Here is why these companies make compelling investments.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThe e-commerce retailer uses AI to manage the army of robots in its warehouses, where they work around the clock to help achieve lightning-fast delivery speeds, sometimes within hours of a customer order.\n\nAmazon's AI technology also can predict which products are in demand based on location and when customers will want them. This enables the company to work with suppliers to make sure these products are in stock when needed.\n\nAI also helps third-party sellers on Amazon's site to create product listings. The success of these sellers is important: They delivered $34.3 billion of Amazon's $143.1 billion in third-quarter sales. That's more than the $23.1 billion in third-quarter revenue generated by Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing platform.\n\nAWS provides AI services to other businesses, such as United Airlines, helping AWS to maintain its position as the global leader in cloud computing.\n\nThat enabled Amazon to achieve a 13% year-over-year jump in third-quarter sales to $143.1 billion. The company expects fourth-quarter sales to reach at least $160 billion, a 7% increase over the previous year.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet uses AI across an array of services. For example, its YouTube receives over 500 hours of content every minute. That requires AI to ensure all videos comply with YouTube policies, and over 95% of removed videos were detected by AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe technology is also strengthening its position in the search-engine space. If you have used Google to perform a search with a photo, it was Alphabet's AI that analyzed the image.\n\nAI is also a component of the company's all-important advertising business, which accounted for $59.6 billion of Alphabet's $76.7 billion in third-quarter revenue. It helps advertisers create digital ads, and as of the third quarter, around 80% of advertisers were using the company's AI products.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be a momentous one as it plans to change how its Chrome web browser targets consumers with digital ads. On top of that, forecasts suggest a strong year in 2024 for digital advertising, with predictions calling for 13% growth in digital ad spending, which is higher than the past two years. This suggests it will be a windfall year for Alphabet's ad business.\n\n3. Palantir\n\nLast year, data analytics company Palantir released its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), and it's been a boon. Businesses are using it to boost operations, such as improving procurement efficiencies, and increasing the fill rate for online orders.\n\nPalantir nearly tripled the number of businesses using AIP in the third quarter alone as its customer count jumped 34% year over year.\n\nIts AI capabilities only strengthen Palantir's economic moat since its systems were built to handle classified government intelligence data. This enabled the company to win customers such as the U.S. government's Special Operations Command (SOCOM), which awarded Palantir a multiyear contract to help its AI-powered mission command platform.\n\nThe demand for Palantir's AI feature helped to deliver strong results. In the third quarter, the company enjoyed double-digit revenue growth as sales rose from $477.9 million in 2022 to $558.2 million. And this is just the latest in years of rising revenue. PLTR Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company also achieved what CEO Alexander Karp called, \"the most significant profit in our company's 20-year history\" as third-quarter net income reached $73.4 million, a dramatic turnaround from the prior year's net loss of $123.9 million.\n\nAnd exiting the third quarter, Palantir's balance sheet was impressive. Total assets were $4.2 billion with $3.3 billion of that in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Contrast this with total liabilities of $921.5 million.\n\nThe secular trend of artificial intelligenceis delivering meaningful results for Palantir, Alphabet, and Amazon. As a result, these three companies are well positioned to deliver ongoing revenue growth over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Salesforce, Inc. CRM, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, Colgate-Palmolive Company CL and American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Alphabet, Salesforce and Comcast\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., Salesforce, Inc. and Comcast Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAlphabet shares have matched the Zacks Internet - Services industry's performance over the past year (+46.7% vs. +46.2%), but outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (+42.6%) and the S&P 500 index (+20.8%). The company’s strong cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Moreover, expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.\r\n\r\nAlso, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Alphabet’s expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well.\r\n\r\nIts growing efforts to gain a foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. However, sluggishness in the company’s Network advertisement business remains a headwind. Additionally, its growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Salesforce have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+80.2% vs. +57.6%). The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The company’s sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line.\r\n\r\nContinued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams. Salesforce’s strategy of continuously expanding generative AI offerings will help the company tap the growing opportunities in the space.\r\n\r\nHowever, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Also, the challenging macroeconomic environment could hurt its growth prospects.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here >>>)\r\n\r\nComcast shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (+10.7% vs. +9.0%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the third quarter. Broadband user base increased in the reported quarter.\r\n\r\nComcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company expand much faster and at a lower cost compared with competitors. Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for the company’s profitability. Its streaming service, Peacock, is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales.

        "title": "Nvidia Dominates the AI Market, but Don't Ignore These 3 Challengers",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 1,420% over the past five years. Its growth was largely driven by the expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which prompted more companies to install its high-end GPUs in their data centers.\n\nNvidia generated 80% of its revenue from its data center chips in its latest quarter, while its gaming business -- its original growth engine prior to the AI boom -- only brought in 16% of its revenue. The bulls believe Nvidia's data center business will continue growing as companies develop more advanced generative AI platforms and large language models, and that its GPUs will remain the industry standard for processing those complicated tasks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's current list of customers supports that bullish view. ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Amazon, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and other tech giants all use its chips to power their AI services. But over the long term, other chipmakers could loosen Nvidia's iron grip on the AI market. Let's take a closer look at the three most likely challengers.\n\n1. Intel\n\nNvidia's GPUs usually work alongside Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) high-end Xeon CPUs in data centers to accelerate machine learning and AI tasks. For Intel, which still controls about 94% of the server CPU market, Nvidia's expansion into the data center market is an unwelcome intrusion which implies its CPUs can't efficiently handle AI tasks on their own.\n\nCPUs still process one piece of data at a time, while GPUs process a large array of integers and floating point numbers simultaneously -- which makes them better suited for graphics and AI applications. To close that gap, Intel launched its own line of Xe GPUs in September 2020, and its Xe-HP (High Performance) and Xe-HPC (High Performance Compute) directly target Nvidia's data center GPUs. It followed that up with the rollout of its new \"Max\" data center GPUs last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an unusual departure from its first-party foundry model, Intel outsources the production of its GPUs to its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- which also manufactures Nvidia's high-end GPUs. Those chips haven't gained much momentum yet, but Intel's ongoing expansion of that business -- and its ability to bundle its GPUs with its Xeon CPUs -- might eventually hurt Nvidia.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nNvidia's expansion into the data center market gave it an edge against Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which controls a much smaller slice of the discrete GPU market. However, AMD has been fighting back with its new Instinct data center chips for AI tasks.\n\nIt launched its first three Instinct GPUs (the MI6, MI8, and MI25) in 2017, which were followed by additional 7-nanometer and 6nm MI chips over the following four years. It launched its latest MI300 Instinct chips, which were built on TSMC's 5nm and 6nm nodes, last December. In the latest benchmarks, AMD's top-tier MI300X beats Nvidia's H100 in terms of processing power and memory bandwidth, but Nvidia claims the H100 still outperforms the MI300X when it's running on optimized software.\n\nAMD's AI ambitions could cause problems for Nvidia, especially if it continues its tradition of selling its chips at lower prices. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are already testing or running Instinct GPUs -- and that customer list could grow longer as cost-conscious data center operators shop around for the best deals.\n\n3. Internally developed chips\n\nLast but not least, Nvidia's dominance of the data center GPU market is driving many of its top customers -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta -- to develop their own AI accelerator chips. It could take years for those projects to bear fruit, but the development of those chips raises red flags for Nvidia's long-term growth.\n\nLast year, Google published a research paper that suggested its own fourth-generation TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) were faster and more efficient than Nvidia's A100 chips. Meta also recently poached an entire research team from Graphcore, the AI start-up that claims its \"graph processing\" method can process AI tasks more efficiently than Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThese tech giants are still buying a lot of Nvidia's A100 GPUs to process their AI tasks, but they could gradually replace those chips with their first-party silicon to cut costs. If that happens, Nvidia's biggest growth engine could sputter out.\n\nInvestors shouldn't assume Nvidia is invincible\n\nNvidia's future looks bright, but investors should expect it to face some unpredictable challenges over the next few years. Intel, AMD, and first-party chips won't throttle its growth anytime soon, but they could eventually evolve into major threats. Simply put, investors shouldn't assume Nvidia is an invincible leader of the AI market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Forget Microsoft in 2024: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) skyrocketed after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022. The chatbot highlighted how far AI has come, with the potential to advance countless industries, including cloud computing, e-commerce, consumer products, healthcare, education, autonomous driving, and more.\n\nIn fact, according to data from Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. The market's trajectory would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the decade's end. As a result, it's not surprising that numerous AI stocks have soared over the last year.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) shares have climbed 69% since last January, rallying Wall Street with its 49% stake in OpenAI. The partnership has granted Microsoft access to some of the industry's most advanced AI models, suggesting the Windows company has significant potential in the sector.\n\nHowever, AI is expanding quickly, presenting dozens of other attractive ways to invest in the industry. Some of these options could have more growth potential than Microsoft, or offer more value.\n\nSo forget Microsoft in 2024. Here are two AI stocks to buy instead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're probably aware of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) meteoric rise last year. Its stock soared 239% in 2023 as the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for AI developers worldwide.\n\nAs interest in AI soared, so did demand for GPUs, and Nvidia was perfectly positioned to supply its hardware to the entire market. The company achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI chips alongside soaring earnings.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended October 2023), Nvidia's revenue rose 206% year over year as operating income increased 1,600%. The company profited from a spike in AI GPU sales, represented by a 279% rise in data center revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has a powerful position in AI. Competition in the software side of the industry is heating up, with companies like Microsoft and Amazon facing off over leadership in AI cloud services. However, increased competition only means more chip customers for Nvidia, with the company likely to flourish for years. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows that over the next two fiscal years, Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share, while Microsoft's may achieve about $15 per share. Multiplying these figures by each company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (Nvidia's 48 and Microsoft's 35) yields stock prices of $1,152 for Nvidia and $525 for Microsoft.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 96% and Microsoft's 33% over the next two fiscal years. While both figures are impressive, Nvidia's higher percentage and prominent role in AI make it a more attractive investment this year.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has massive potential in AI.\n\nThe company has grown into a tech behemoth, hosting nine products with more than 1 billion users. Its top performers are Google Search, Android, and Chrome. While these services enabled Alphabet to build a lucrative digital advertising business, they could also prove to be assets in its AI expansion.\n\nLast December Alphabet unveiled Gemini, a highly anticipated AI model that is expected to be competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4. The popularity of Alphabet's various services and Gemini could prove to be a powerful combination. With the new model, Alphabet could create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, offer more effective advertising, introduce new AI tools on Google Cloud, and better track viewing trends on YouTube.\n\nAlphabet surpassed $77 billion in free cash flow last year, significantly more than rivals Microsoft or Amazon. The company's considerable cash reserves strengthen its outlook in AI, as it has the funds to invest heavily in its research and development and overcome potential hurdles. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThese charts show Alphabet's stock is also far cheaper than Microsoft's. The company has lower figures in two key valuation metrics: forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, forward P/S divides its market cap by estimated revenue. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nForward P/E and P/S are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares, as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In this case, Alphabet is a far bigger bargain than Microsoft on both fronts. Alongside considerable potential in AI, Alphabet is a no-brainer buy in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The market expects Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +52.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $70.71 billion, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alphabet Inc.\n\nFor Alphabet Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.26%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Alphabet Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alphabet Inc. Would post earnings of $1.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.55, delivering a surprise of +6.90%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The market expects Alphabet (GOOGL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis internet search leader is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +52.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $70.71 billion, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

        "title": "Why Investors Need to Take Advantage of These 2 Computer and Technology Stocks Now",
        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Alphabet (GOOGL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.64 a share seven days away from its upcoming earnings release on January 30, 2024.\n\nAlphabet's Earnings ESP sits at 2.26%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.64 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.60.\n\nGOOGL is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on January 29, 2024. SMCI's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $5.48 a share six days from its next earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Super Micro Computer, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.07 is 8.19%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, GOOGL and SMCI could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Salesforce, Inc. CRM, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, Colgate-Palmolive Company CL and American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Alphabet, Salesforce and Comcast\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., Salesforce, Inc. and Comcast Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAlphabet shares have matched the Zacks Internet - Services industry's performance over the past year (+46.7% vs. +46.2%), but outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (+42.6%) and the S&P 500 index (+20.8%). The company's strong cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Moreover, expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.\r\n\r\nAlso, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Alphabet's expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well.\r\n\r\nIts growing efforts to gain a foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. However, sluggishness in the company's Network advertisement business remains a headwind. Additionally, its growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Salesforce have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+80.2% vs. +57.6%). The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The company's sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line.\r\n\r\nContinued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams. Salesforce's strategy of continuously expanding generative AI offerings will help the company tap the growing opportunities in the space.\r\n\r\nHowever, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Also, the challenging macroeconomic environment could hurt its growth prospects.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here >>>)\r\n\r\nComcast shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (+10.7% vs. +9.0%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the third quarter. Broadband user base increased in the reported quarter.\r\n\r\nComcast's plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company expand much faster and at a lower cost compared with competitors. Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for the company's profitability. Its streaming service, Peacock, is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increasing competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Colgate-Palmolive Company and American Water Works Company, Inc..\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "Returns on Capital Paint A Bright Future For Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)",
        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) look very promising so lets take a look.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Alphabet:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.26 = US$81b ÷ (US$397b - US$86b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThus, Alphabet has an ROCE of 26%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 9.0%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for Alphabet.\n\nSo How Is Alphabet's ROCE Trending?\n\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Alphabet. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 26%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 63%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Alphabet thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nOur Take On Alphabet's ROCE\n\nTo sum it up, Alphabet has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Since the stock has returned a staggering 173% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Alphabet looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

        "content": "Warren Buffett used to think that 'predicting' the stock market was the most important thing in investing — until 1 book changed his life forever. Here's the real key to long-term gains\n\nWarren Buffett is one of the most renowned investors of our time. So, it’s easy to forget that he was once a beginner too.\n\nBuffett claims he bought his first stock at age 11 and spent his first eight years in the market focusing on stock price movements instead of studying the underlying companies.\n\nDon’t miss\n\nCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2024 Take control of your finances in 2024: 5 money moves to start the new year off strong\n\n“I had the whole wrong idea,” he said in a 2022 interview with journalist Charlie Rose. “I thought the important thing was to predict what a stock would do and predict the stock market.” Buffett says he even read books on technical analysis and charted stocks.\n\nHowever, when he was 19 or 20 years old he read a book that would change his perspective forever: “The Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham. Instead of charting stocks or \"stock picking,\" Graham advocated for the valuation of underlying companies. His theory is that stock prices eventually follow the company’s financial performance.\n\nTo paraphrase Graham in another one of his books, \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\"\n\nThis simple philosophy shifted Buffett’s view on investing forever. “I realized that I was doing it exactly the wrong way,” he said. “I rejiggered my mind, when I read the book ...”\n\nThis philosophy has worked for Buffett over many decades and could serve retail investors looking for new opportunities in 2024. Here are two companies that seem misaligned with their stock prices this year.\n\nGSK\n\nGSK plc (GSK) is arguably undervalued. The stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.91. It also offers a dividend yield of 3.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe underlying business is in a transition. Activist hedge fund Elliott Management took a position in the company in 2021, pushing for changes to unlock value. In 2022, the company spun off its consumer health-care division into a new independent firm called Haleon. The spinoff was said to be financially beneficial for GSK. \"One of the perks for GSK of the demerger was also a £7bn dividend which helped to reduce net debt of £19.8bn at the end of 2021,\" reported the Financial Times.\n\nThe company has been focused on its core pharmaceuticals and vaccine products. This seems to be delivering growth. In 2023, GSK raised its guidance for the year twice. It expects revenue to be as much as 13% higher and adjusted earnings per share to be as much as 20% higher than the previous year.\n\nStrong sales and a low valuation should put this megacorporation on your radar of undervalued stocks.\n\nRead more: This Pennsylvania trio bought a $100K abandoned school and turned it into a 31-unit apartment building — how to invest in real estate without all the heavy lifting\n\nAlphabet\n\nGoogle’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) is in the midst of an interesting battle. Rivals have deployed billions into large language models and artificial intelligence that some say could erode Google’s dominance in the search market.\n\n“[Google is] the 800-pound gorilla in this [market] … I want people to know that we made them dance,” Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella told The Verge shortly after OpenAI released ChatGPT.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff Bezos has bet on another AI startup, Perplexity AI, that’s also trying to capture some of this lucrative market.\n\nFor now, Google retains its crown as the king of search engines. The platform holds 91.61% market share, as of December 2023, according to data from StatCounter. Google is also actively competing in the AI race with its ChatGPT rival Bard, which is being gradually integrated across the company’s portfolio of apps.\n\nThese initiatives could help the company sustain its growth momentum. In the third quarter of 2023, the firm reported 11% growth in revenue and 41.5% growth in net income year-over-year. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.22, which isn’t cheap but could be justified by this robust growth rate.\n\nThis fair-valued stock should certainly be on your watchlist for 2024 as the AI race heats up.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nRobert Kiyosaki warns: ‘Cash is trash’ — Discover the power of diversifying with gold now Only 20% of Americans are confident they'll have a comfortable retirement — use this 1 magic move to get back on track ASAP (It will only take seconds but most people don't do it.)

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 5 Top Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Investing is a long-term game. You win by finding great companies and then buying and holding them. Your investment will grow in value as the underlying businesses grow.\n\nSo, how do you apply that mindset to technology stocks, where it's often a matter of disrupting your competition or being disrupted? It can be tricky, but there are bonafide winners with the size and fundamentals to continue thriving for years.\n\nHere are five of the very best companies in the tech sector. Consider adding these to a diversified portfolio, and you'll get richer while sleeping well at night.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a hot trend on Wall Street. Still, AI will likely grow and develop over the coming decades. Chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has quickly established itself as the chip kingpin of this new era. Its graphics processing chips specialize in demanding applications, and that natural fit catapulted the company to an estimated AI chip market share between 80% and 95%.\n\nIt's hard to see Nvidia completely losing that market share, even if competitors chip away at it over time. The companies investing in AI are spending billions of dollars, which could make it harder to get them to switch from what's already working. AI unlocked a new level of growth at Nvidia last year, but AI's long-term potential means that the stock should enjoy years of growth.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nModern technology is built on the cloud -- centralized servers and data centers that shift computing power off organizations' premises. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) might have built its reputation on e-commerce, but its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, is the world's leader. That makes the stock a no-brainer long-term buy and hold.\n\nToday, Amazon holds nearly a third of the global cloud platform market, meaning that most of your online web activity at least touches AWS at one point or another. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow by 20% annually through the decade's end, which will almost certainly trickle to AWS. Add in Amazon's other business units, and the future looks bright.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nData has arguably become the critical resource companies and governments crave in this modern world. Data helps companies know their customers, themselves, and their competitors. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has arguably the most data of any company on Earth thanks to its decades of dominance in Google Search and YouTube. These are the world's two most heavily trafficked sites.\n\nFor investors, Alphabet's massive audience gives it many billions of dollars in high-margin advertising revenue, which helped the company bring in over $77 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months alone. The company's data, deep pockets, and AI potential mean that Alphabet will likely leverage itself into years of growth ahead.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nSocial media has become a regular part of daily life for people worldwide, and nobody does it better than Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). The company owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, making money by showing ads to the 3.96 billion people using its apps monthly. The company's a cash cow, generating $37 billion in cash flow over the past year, and invests heavily into new opportunities, like AI and the metaverse via Reality Labs.\n\nStudies have shown that social media is addictive, which, admittedly, probably isn't great for its users' mental health but makes Meta Platforms' core business very sticky. While many of the world's largest companies are led by outsiders, Meta is still headed by its co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who is only 39. He's built the company into the tech giant it is today, so long-term investors should feel great about Meta's future.\n\n5. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCybersecurity has become one of the most critical pieces of any corporate budget. Getting hacked or suffering a data breach can cost a company millions in financial and reputational damage. CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) is part of a new generation of security companies, leaning on AI and cloud technology to provide security that learns in real-time, something legacy solutions like antivirus software can't match.\n\nCrowdStrike is by far the youngest company on this list, but it's established itself as a leader in its field. Notably, the business is already quite profitable despite still chasing revenue growth. More than 23,000 organizations use CrowdStrike, which sells its products in modules. Customers buy access to more modules as CrowdStrike expands its offerings, leading to durable growth from adding new customers and cross-selling to existing ones. Cybersecurity isn't going anywhere, making CrowdStrike a security leader to hold onto.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "AI Cheat Sheet: The 5 Most Popular Stock Picks (and Why)",
        "content": "If you got sick of all the artificial intelligence (AI) talk in 2023, you should know it probably won't lessen in 2024. With some saying AI and machine learning (ML) could be as transformational to business as the internet, it's best to roll with it. Especially because the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes AI will impact 40% of jobs globally.\n\nAI/ML is an expansive area, so it may be tough to know where to start. Just a few examples of the technology include:\n\nSpeech recognition (great for automobiles and drive-thru kiosks) Chatbots (terrific for online customer service and many other functions) Cybersecurity applications Virtual assistants Autonomous vehicles Factory robotics Medical research and diagnosis\n\nWhile the arena is massive, there are a few popular companies investors should know right off the bat. I'll start right at the top with heavyweights Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and then up-and-comers like Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) and UiPath(NYSE: PATH).\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia is among the most important companies because of its high-powered, essential data center hardware and software. Without Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and other products, AI applications would be difficult to execute. This has brought the company incredible success, which the infographic below depicts. NVDA INFOGRAPHIC\n\nFirst, we can see that total revenue increased 205% year over year (YOY) to $18 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 on the back of data center revenue, which increased 278% to $14.5 billion -- a ridiculous clip. Even more incredible, data center growth accelerated in Q3 of fiscal year 2024, eclipsing 171% in Q2.\n\nThe next major takeaway is the company's operating income (center of the graphic). It soared 1,633% to $10.4 billion on a 57% margin. Nvidia's profits skyrocketed because demand was higher than supply. They cannot produce enough to satisfy their customers, so they have pricing power.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has some challenges, like U.S. restrictions on exports to China and competition working hard; however, Nvidia creates new chips that meet export requirements to China, and it has a significant head start on competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\n\nTrading at 74 times earnings, the stock isn't cheap and likely won't be anytime soon. This drops to 46x on a forward basis (compared to Microsoft at 35x), which is more palatable. NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nWall Street has a history of underestimating Nvidia's future earnings. Still, be cautious at the current price or consider dollar-cost averaging.\n\nAlphabet\n\nIn late 2022, Alphabet found itself caught flat-footed when OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the stage, and Microsoft invested billions to bring the generative AI tech to Bing. Suddenly, there was serious competition for Google Search -- Alphabet's gravy train that produced $127 billion in revenue through Q3 2023, 57% of the company's total sales.\n\nLuckily, Alphabet has studied AI for years and has many solutions that have come out or are coming soon. There is Bard, Alphabet's answer to ChatGPT. Alphabet recently upgraded Bard with its Gemini tech to enhance its performance.\n\nGoogle Search has new features that allow users to search with a picture, optimize translation services, and provide more relevant results. The company developed its own chip, the tensor processing unit (TPU), for generative AI applications. Perhaps the ChatGPT release was the kick in the pants Alphabet needed to get its AI program to the market.\n\nAlphabet's sales are up 7% YOY through Q3 2023 to $221 billion; however, growth accelerated to 11% in the last quarter. More impressively, cash from operations is up 22% this year, reaching $83 billion to show that Alphabet is still a cash-flow machine. The stock is fairly valued, trading close to its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon is among the most exciting AI companies because it benefits from AI on multiple fronts. Generative AI software requires massive data processing, much of which runs through the cloud. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest provider of cloud services. Growth at AWS slowed in 2023 because companies cut their data usage budgets in anticipation of a recession, but AI and increased budgets could turn this around in 2024.\n\nThe company also uses AI in digital advertising and logistics, and Amazon Bedrock provides foundational models for companies to tailor AI applications to their needs.\n\nWhile AWS growth slowed in 2023, areas like digital advertising thrived, and Amazon grew total revenue by 11% through Q3 2023 to $405 billion. Positive free cash flow and net income also returned after a difficult 2022.\n\nThe stock trades well below its recent averages based on operating cash flow and sales, as shown below. AMZN PS Ratio data by YCharts. CFO = cash flow from operations. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio.\n\nThe valuation and opportunity make Amazon stock an alluring buy.\n\nPalantir\n\nPalantir has been unapologetically hyping its AI prowess since before AI was the thing to be. The company helps governments and businesses manage, analyze, visualize, and act on data. It also provides a platform where clients can build and deploy applications, and its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software expands on this by using AI to enhance logical decision-making.\n\nPalantir is a critical partner in the defense industry and is making strides in the private sector. Last quarter, private sector sales increased 23% YOY to $251 million, while government sales grew 12% to $308 million. Palantir also achieved its fourth straight quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits, has $3.3 billion in cash and investments, and has no long-term debt. It's no wonder it's a popular stock. Still, its 17% YOY growth last quarter may not justify its current valuation of 17x sales.\n\nUiPath\n\nUiPath is getting some well-deserved attention lately. The company is a leader in robotic process automation (RPA). RPA has many use cases that get to the heart of AI/ML: efficiency.\n\nFor instance, picture a large company that receives hundreds of invoices daily through email. Instead of manually downloading and inputting them (as is the case now), RPA does this automatically with minimal human intervention. This is why UiPath reported $1.4 billion annual recurring revenue on 24% growth and over 10,800 customers last quarter.\n\nThere is intense industry competition, namely from Microsoft, which gives investors pause. However, the company is on firm financial footing, reporting $1.75 billion in cash and investments with no long-term debt, and trades for just 10x sales. This makes UiPath a very compelling stock for growth-oriented investors.\n\nMany terrific companies are doing innovative things in AI. Of these popular companies, I think Amazon and UiPath are the most intriguing buys based on potential and valuation; however, each name has a lot to like.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Sundar Pichai Lays Out 7 Goals For Google in 2024, Highlighting Cost Savings and A.I.",
        "content": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai may be issuing more job cuts in 2024. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s “year of efficiency” initiative for 2023 has paid off handsomely. And now Google (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai is pulling something similar that could mean more job cuts for the tech giant’s nearly 200,000 employees.\n\nIn an internal memo last week, first reported by The Verge, Pichai laid out seven goals for Google in 2024:\n\nDeliver the world’s most advanced, safe and responsible A.I. Improve knowledge, learning, creativity and productivity. Build the most helpful personal computing platforms and devices. Enable organizations and developers to innovate on Google Cloud. Provide the world’s most trusted products and platforms. Build a Google that’s extraordinary for Googlers and the world. Improve company velocity, efficiency and productivity, and deliver durable cost savings.\n\nOne item that stood out from this list is the last bullet point about efficiency and “durable cost savings.” At the beginning of 2023, Pichai, who is also the CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet (GOOGL), announced a plan to lay off 12,000 employees, or 6 percent of the company’s workforce. Apparently that’s not enough. In the first three weeks of 2024 so far, Alphabet has already cut over 1,000 employees across various departments, including ad sales, engineering, hardware and YouTube.\n\n“We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,” Pichai said in a separate internal memo on Jan. 17 . “The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices.”\n\nDespite cost savings, in his list of 2024 goals Pichai highlighted Google’s commitment to A.I., a central battle field for Big Tech companies. In December 2023, Google unveiled Gemini, its latest answer to OpenAI’s GPT model. The new A.I. model is supposed to encompass all of Google’s products, as the company is also launching two more advanced versions named Gemini Pro and Gemini Ultra.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) closed at $147.71 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.18% move from the prior day. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.22% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.36%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.32%.\n\nThe company's stock has climbed by 3.68% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.64% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.61%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.60, signifying a 52.38% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $70.71 billion, indicating a 12.03% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.26% upward. Alphabet Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Alphabet Inc. has a Forward P/E ratio of 22.21 right now. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 25.98.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, GOOG's PEG ratio is currently 1.32. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Services industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.93.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 75, placing it within the top 30% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia's rivals are circling, but they're still years from catching up",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is the AI king. Its share of the global AI chip market is estimated at anywhere between 70% and 90%. Its high-powered graphics processors, which are perfect for training AI models and putting them to work, are in such demand that getting them is a task all its own.\n\nIn June, with the AI craze in full swing, Nvidia’s market cap eclipsed the $1 trillion mark. And on Friday, shares of the company hit an all-time high of $549.91.\n\nIt’s not just Nvidia’s hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The company’s Cuda software, which developers use to create AI platforms, is just as important to Nvidia’s staying power.\n\n“Software continues to be Nvidia's strategic moat,” explained Gartner VP analyst Chirag Dekate. “These ... turnkey experiences enable Nvidia to be at the forefront of mindshare, as well as adoption.”\n\nNvidia’s lead didn’t happen overnight. It’s been working on AI products for years, even as investors questioned the move.\n\n“Nvidia, to its credit, started about 15 years ago working with universities to find novel things that you could do with GPUs, aside from gaming and visualization,” explained Moor Insights & Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead.\n\n“What Nvidia does is they help create markets and that puts competitors in a very tough situation out there, because by the time they've caught up, Nvidia is on to the next new thing,” he added. Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the Hon Hai Tech Day in Taipei on Oct. 18, 2023. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nBut threats to Nvidia’s reign are rising. Rivals Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) are marshaling their forces to grab their own slice of the AI pie. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s own data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nIt’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Meta (META), are increasingly turning to their own chips in the form of what are known as ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits.\n\nStory continues\n\nThink of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it.\n\nASICs, on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. They’re built specifically for a company’s own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\n\nThat’s a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as hyperscalers focus more on their own ASICs, they may have less of a need for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThat said, on the whole Nvidia’s technology is well ahead of its competitors.\n\n“They have a ... long-term research pipeline to continue driving the future of GPU leadership,” Dekate explained. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind when it comes to AI chips is how they’re used. The first way is training models, which is called, well, training. The second is putting those models into practice so that people can use them to do things like generate a specific output you want, whether that’s in the form of a text, images, or something else entirely. That’s called inferencing.\n\nOpenAI has inferences of ChatGPT, while Microsoft has inferences of Copilot. And every time you send a request to either program, they take advantage of AI accelerators to generate the text or image you want.\n\nOver time, inferencing is likely to become the primary use case for AI chips as more companies seek to take advantage of different AI models.\n\nStill, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. So even if Nvidia’s market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAlphabet shares have matched the Zacks Internet - Services industry's performance over the past year (+46.7% vs. +46.2%), but outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (+42.6%) and the S&P 500 index (+20.8%). The company’s strong cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Moreover, expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.\r\n\r\nAlso, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Alphabet’s expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well.\r\n\r\nIts growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. However, sluggishness in the company’s Network advertisement business remains a headwind. Additionally, its growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Salesforce have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+80.2% vs. +57.6%). The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The company’s sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line.\r\n\r\nContinued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams. Salesforce’s strategy of continuously expanding generative AI offerings will help the company tap the growing opportunities in the space.\r\n\r\nHowever, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Also, the challenging macroeconomic environment could hurt its growth prospects.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here >>>)\r\n\r\nComcast shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (+10.7% vs. +9.0%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the third quarter. Broadband user base increased in the reported quarter.\r\n\r\nComcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help the company expand much faster and at a lower cost compared with competitors. Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for the company’s profitability. Its streaming service, Peacock, is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increasing competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL), Baker Hughes Company (BKR) and American Water Works Company, Inc.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is under fire from employees past and present who think that the company's leadership lacks vision.\n\nWhat Happened: Diane Hirsh Theriault, a software engineer at Google, criticized the tech giant’s leadership on LinkedIn earlier last week. Theriault asserted that the company lacks visionary leaders and has been conducting random layoffs for the past six to 12 months.\n\nTheriault described Google’s leaders as “profoundly boring and glassy-eyed,” stating that the company hasn’t launched a successful executive-driven initiative in years.\n\nThe employee also criticized Google’s approach to product development, comparing it to the BogoSort algorithm, where elements are reordered randomly until they land in order.\n\nAccording to the post, Google’s executives are trying to steer the company towards artificial intelligence (AI), but without a clear vision.\n\nMeanwhile, layoffs continue across various departments, including engineering, sales, support, UX, product, data science, and SRE.\n\nSee Also: Ex-Googler Calls Out CEO Sundar Pichai’s ‘Lack Of Visionary Leadership,’ Says Company Morale At ‘An All-Time Low’\n\nThe employee also highlighted a growing sense of nihilism among the staff, with many choosing to just do their jobs until they are let go. The post ended with a lament for the loss of Google’s once magical work environment and the fear-driven atmosphere that has replaced it.\n\nAccording to Equity Research Analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Justin Patterson, Google CEO Sundar Pichai'squest for \"durable cost savings\" might have harmed the company.\n\n\"While we expect layoffs will be more modest than 2022’s, we do believe Alphabet may have unintentionally harmed productivity by creating uncertainty over which roles will be affected,\" Patterson noted.\n\nWhy It Matters: This isn’t the first time Google’s leadership has been called into question. In November, former Google employee Ian “Hixie” Hickinsoncriticized Pichai for displaying a \"lack of visionary leadership\" and disinterest in maintaining the ethos of Google that made it a successful company.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe also stated that the employee morale at Google is at an all-time low and that therapists in the Bay Area would say that all Googlers are “unhappy” with the company.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Tim Cook Shares BTS Of Apple’s Next Big Bet As Vision Pro Pre-Orders Are Now Live\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: World Economic Forum on Flickr\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report ALPHABET (GOOG): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Google's Sundar Pichai Wants To Focus On 'Durable Cost Savings' In 2024 While His Engineers Ring Alarm Bells Over 'Lack Of Vision' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The Market Isn't Following the Classic January Script",
        "content": "January so far is unfolding far differently than the stock market playbook suggests.\n\nWhen people talk about the January effect in the stock market, they are referring to any of four separate but overlapping things.\n\nThe overall market tends to rise in January. Small stocks usually beat big ones. Last year's disasters often come roaring back. The month of January allegedly predicts the full year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with PFE.\n\nSo far this year, the market isn't following the classic playbook. Through Jan. 19, the market was indeed up, but barely. Stocks have gained 1.54% as measured by the most widely used gauge, the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.56%.\n\nSmall stocks aren't performing as they're supposed to. The Russell 2000 Index of small stocks was down 4.05%, even after including dividends.\n\nMissing rebound\n\nWhat about last year's big losers? Normally, they would rebound. For tax reasons, people often sell losers in November and December, recording losses they can use to offset gains elsewhere. Some of these tax-loss punching bags get pushed down below their inherent value. Normally, they bounce in January.\n\nBut this year, the January rebound is missing.\n\nAs a sample of last year's losers, I chose 10 stocks that were down 8% to 50% in 2023. They included such well-known names as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), as well as some lesser-known names.\n\nEight of these 10 losers were down 30% or more in 2023, and six were down 40% or more. By contrast, the S&P 500 was up more than 26% last year, including dividends. From such severe underperformance, I expected to see a rebound, at least what Wall Street calls a dead cat bounce.\n\nIt hasn't happened. Eight of the 10 losers in my sample have kept right on falling. As a group, the 10 are down 6.04% through Jan. 19, rubbing salt in the wound of last year's losses.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nTo understand why January is not following the normal playbook, it helps to look at the anatomy of this January's advance. I used Guru Focus software to run some diagnostic x-rays.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are 35 U.S. stocks with a market value of $200 billion or more. Through Jan. 19, their median gain is 2.9%.\n\nBy contrast, if we look at a sample of mid-sized stocks, the median return so far this year is a loss of 1.45%. And if we look at small stocks, it's a loss of 3.3%.\n\nThat shows this year's market advance is due entirely to the big boys. Stocks like Microsoft Corp. ((NASDAQ:MSFT), up 6%), Alphabet Inc. ((NASDAQ:GOOGL), up 4.8%) and Nvidia Corp. ((NASDAQ:NVDA), up 20.1%) have a big weight in the S&P 500, and push market indices up, even as the typical stock goes nowhere.\n\nIt's also revealing to slice things up by market sectors. In health care, the median stock is down 1.35%. Real estate stocks are down 2.16%, even after dividends are included. In the industrial sector, the typical loss is 2.61%.\n\nPeople say that this is a tech-driven market, but wait a minute. The median technology stock is down 1.85%. So it's big tech that's driving the bus, not all tech.\n\nThe barometer\n\nA final bit of January lore is the notion that January predicts the full year. But data throw cold water on this idea.\n\nI've studied the accuracy of the so-called January Barometer over 74 years, from 1950 to the present. In the simplest form, the barometer has been correct 73% of the time.\n\nSound pretty good? It's not, because a naive forecasting model, which simply declares that every year will be an up year, is correct 77% of the time.\n\nThen, too, January is part of the year it is supposed to predict. If you remove that head start factor and make January predict the next 11 months, the barometer works only 68% of the time.\n\nFinally, the barometer does very poorly as a warning system. When January is down, the full year is still up in most cases. The accuracy rate for down Januaries is only 43%, or 41% is the head-start factor is removed.\n\nThere are still several days to go this month, so we'll see whether January is an up month or a down month. Either way, don't put too much faith in what it tells you.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston.

        "content": "As part of Yahoo Finance's AI Revolution week, Radio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook for generative AI adoption and corporate valuations. He argues \"we are no closer to superintelligence, I would believe, than we were 10 years ago,\" despite perceptions of AI models becoming more \"superintelligent.\"\n\nWindsor says AI hype and competition may spark damaging price wars, making valuations unsustainable. He sees names like Nvidia (NVDA) facing \"significant correction\" eventually as hype fades, though presently \"it is the AI training place to go and no one has really laid a glove on the company yet.\"\n\nFor other AI exposure, Windsor advises looking at Google (GOOG,GOOGL) and Meta (META) which have \"significant exposure to AI, but it's not really been priced in.\" However, he cautions their revenue does not come from generative AI yet, making it a long-term play.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Alphabet's division for developing new technology is laying off dozens of workers as it turns to outside investors to help fund its projects, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe division, X Lab, is switching to a structure that will enable its ventures to be more easily spun out of the unit with support from Alphabet and outside investors, the report said, adding that the layoffs were focused on support staff.\n\n\"X tackles global challenges like climate change and connectivity and we continually look for ways to streamline how we bring our moonshots to life,\" a spokeswoman for the division told Reuters.\n\nX Lab is Alphabet's research division that takes on special projects like \"Taara\", which aims to bring internet services to remote areas of the world using beams of light. It has given rise to self-driving technology firm Waymo, drone delivery service Wing and health tech startup Verily Life Sciences.\n\nIt has recently been in talks with venture capitalists, sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms on funding, the report said.\n\nAlphabet's \"Other Bets\" unit, which includes X Lab and houses firms developing cutting-edge and experimental technologies, posted a $1.19 billion loss for the in the third quarter. But the figure was smaller than its $1.6 billion loss a year ago as the Google-parent reined in spending.\n\nThe move on Monday came days after Google said it would lay off hundreds of employees in its advertising sales team and its hardware, Voice Assistant and augmented reality teams amid its aggressive campaign to cut costs and improve efficiency.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",

        "title": "The mental health app data privacy problem is getting worse",
        "content": "Mental health apps have become increasingly common over the past few years, particularly due to the rise in telehealth during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, there's a problem: Data privacy is being compromised in the process.\n\n“Data is incredibly lucrative in the digital space,” Darrell West, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Yahoo Finance. “That’s how companies are making their money. Many large companies derive a substantial part of their revenue from advertising. People want to target their ads on particular people and particular problems. So there’s the risk that if you have a mental health condition linked to depression, there are going to be companies that want to market a medication to people suffering in that way.”\n\nIn 2023 the Federal Trade Commission ordered the mental health platform BetterHelp, which is owned by Teladoc (TDOC), to pay a $7.8 million fine to consumers for sharing their mental health data for advertising purposes with Facebook (META) and Snapchat (SNAP) after previously promising to keep the information private. Talkspace did not meet most of Mozilla's privacy standards for mental health apps. (Apple App Store)\n\nCerebral, a telehealth startup, admitted last year to exposing sensitive patient information to companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, TikTok, and other third-party advertisers. This info included patient names, birth dates, insurance information, and the patient's responses to mental health self-evaluations through the app.\n\nAnd mental health app Talkspace's privacy policy explicitly states the company can \"use inferences about you made when you take their sign-up questionnaire that asks questions about things like your gender identity, sexual orientation, and whether you’re feeling depressed (all before you’re ever offered a privacy policy) for marketing purposes, including tailored ads.\"\n\nMental health app policies 'seemed like a money grab'\n\nOverall, according to the Mozilla Foundation’s Privacy Not Included online buyer’s guide, only two out of the 27 mental health apps available to users met Mozilla's privacy and security standards in 2023: PTSD Coach, a free self-help app created by the US Department of Veteran Affairs, and Wysa, an app that offers both an AI chatbot and chat sessions with live therapists.\n\nStory continues\n\nMozilla began assessing these apps in 2022 due to their surge in popularity during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“We were concerned that maybe the companies might not be prioritizing privacy in a place where privacy seemed paramount,” Privacy Not Included program director Jen Caltrider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the apps fell short of Mozilla’s privacy and security standards in both 2022 and 2023, due to how they control user data, track records, secure private information, or use artificial intelligence.\n\n“It seemed like a money grab, capitalizing on vulnerable people during a bad situation, and it felt really icky,” Caltrider said.\n\nTelehealth is a ballooning industry\n\nA report from Grand View Research estimated that the global telehealth market was valued at roughly $101.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow 24.3% on an annual basis from 2024 to 2030.\n\nNorth America represents the largest market share in the world at 46.3%, though other countries are quickly adopting telehealth as well.\n\nMental health apps are also projected to grow substantially between 2024 and 2030, with Grand View Research estimating a compound annual growth rate of 15.2% after the global mental health app market reached $6.2 billion in 2023.\n\nThis also means there are significantly more opportunities for personal data to be exposed. A December 2022 study of 578 mental health apps published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 44% shared data they collected with third parties.\n\n“I sit on two sides of the fence,” Diane O’Connell, attorney and president at Sorting It Out Inc., told Yahoo Finance. “On one end, the convenience of [mental health apps] has really provided greater access to mental health and physical healthcare. But on the other end, having private health information hackable is a concern as well.”\n\nSomeone using one of these mental health apps to seek help for depression or anxiety may start to see advertisements for antidepressants, even if they have never expressed interest in taking medication.\n\nLegal loopholes\n\nData brokers capitalizing on mental health data is nothing new. A February 2023 report from Duke University found that out of 37 different data brokers that researchers contacted about mental health data, 26 responded, and 11 firms “were ultimately willing and able to sell the requested mental health data.”\n\nIt's also completely legal.\n\nHIPAA — the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act — was implemented in 1996 by President Clinton as a way to “strike a balance that permits important uses of information, while protecting the privacy of people who seek care and healing.” It's now considered America’s primary healthcare privacy law.\n\nHowever, not all entities are bound by HIPAA, including many mental health apps. According to HIPAA Journal, the law applies to “the majority of workers, most health insurance providers, and employers who sponsor or co-sponsor employee health insurance plans.” Those who do not have to abide by HIPAA include life insurers, most schools and school districts, many state agencies, most law enforcement agencies, and many municipal offices. BetterHelp is a mental health app that was fined by the FTC for passing user information on to advertisers. (BetterHelp)\n\n“HIPAA only applies between a conversation or information shared between a doctor and their patient,” Caltrider said. “A lot of these [mental health] apps, you’re not considered patients in the same way. Some of them you are. I think Talkspace is a good example of [how] once you become a client of Talkspace, they have a different privacy policy that will cover your interactions than before you become a client. They have it so that when you’re a client, you have a relationship with an actual therapist as opposed to a coach.”\n\nThis happens often with talk therapy apps, Caltrider explained, adding that HIPAA “doesn’t cover the vast majority of what a lot of people are sharing with mental health apps.”\n\n“People don’t understand that [HIPAA] only covers the communications between the healthcare provider, and so these apps aren’t covered by that,” Caltrider said. Even if HIPAA applies to the conversation between you and a therapist, some of the metadata collected about your appointment times and which apps you use for video calls may not be covered by the law.\n\nHIPAA protections are also contingent on the type of provider you're meeting with; a licensed therapist is considered a healthcare professional, but an emotional coach, professional coach, or volunteer is not.\n\nThe 'Napster argument'\n\nAnother legal loophole that data brokers and mental health app providers are able to use is in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, which extended HIPAA guidelines to those considered “business associates of covered entities,” the HIPAA Journal stated.\n\nAccording to O'Connell, many private equity firms bought medical practices and hospital networks after Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. Because the investors conducting these M&A deals were not in the medical industry, O’Connell explained, the HITECH Act didn’t apply to them since they weren’t considered business associates — a billing, healthcare, or health insurance company — under HIPAA.\n\n“It created this confusion of how do you exchange data in these merger and acquisition deals when you’re not allowed to exchange personal health information with the company who’s actually trying to buy you?” O'Connell said.\n\nThat’s where terms and conditions come into play. O’Connell called it the “Napster argument,” alluding to the former peer-to-peer file-sharing network that shut down permanently in 2001 following multiple lawsuits related to music copyright infringement.\n\n“Napster wasn’t stealing music — it was just creating a platform for people to share it,” O’Connell said. “So you come up with these different arguments on how the regulations don’t apply, and then you create a fact pattern that fits your narrative until somebody takes you to court, and then the judges decide.”\n\nAccording to West, the main issue is that the US lacks a national privacy law, meaning “there aren’t a lot of regulations that govern behavior in this area, and so there’s a wide range of companies out there. Some of them take privacy very seriously, and others do not.”\n\n“We are not opposed to mental health apps,” West said. “There are many virtues. It brings medical services to a wider range of people because you don’t have to physically go to a doctor’s office.”\n\nWest added, “We just want to make sure that people are aware of the risk and that there are better protections built in. And people need to look at the privacy practices of the particular app they’re using to make sure it has the protections that the individual patient wants.”\n\n—\n\nAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and healthcare policy for Yahoo Finance.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.5%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.66 indicates a change of +15.5% from what Alphabet Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet Inc.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $70.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12%. The $254.87 billion and $284.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet Inc. reported revenues of $64.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $1.55 for the same period compares with $1.06 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.45%. The EPS surprise was +6.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alphabet Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet’s Moonshot X Lab Cuts Staff, Turns to Outside Investors",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Alphabet Inc.’s lab for pioneering technology is laying off dozens of employees as it turns to outside investors to help fund its ventures.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlorida Governor DeSantis Drops Out of 2024 Race, Endorses Trump Hong Kong Stocks at 36% Discount Show True Depth of China Gloom Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Say Buy the Dip After Treasury Rout Gloom Over China Assets Is Spreading Beyond Battered Stocks Hedge Funds Rake in Huge Profits Betting on Catastrophe Risk\n\nThe division, known as X, has in recent months ramped up discussions on funding with venture capitalists and other investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as it is private. The lab is adopting a new structure that’ll enable its projects to more easily spin out of X as independent startups with support from Alphabet and outside backers, according to one of the people and an email to staff obtained by Bloomberg.\n\nX seeks bold approaches to major challenges like climate change and connectivity, but its efforts have yielded few durable businesses thus far.\n\n“We’re expanding our approach to focus on spinning out more projects as independent companies funded through market-based capital,” Astro Teller, who leads to lab, wrote in the email. “We’ll do this by opening our scope to collaborate with a broader base of industry and financial partners, and by continuing to emphasize lean teams and capital efficiency.”\n\nAs part of the restructuring, X is laying off dozens of employees, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. The layoffs are focused on support staff, the person said. Alphabet didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nLaunched by Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, X has captured the public imagination by pursuing projects from self-driving cars to high-altitude balloons that connect remote communities to the internet. But in recent years the lab has come under more pressure to show that it can turn its speculative bets into profitable businesses, and Alphabet as a whole is waging a campaign to cut costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Job Cuts at Google Are Now ‘Business as Usual’: Tech Daily\n\nThis month, Google eliminated hundreds of jobs on teams including hardware and engineering, with more cuts potentially on the way as it sharpens its focus on artificial intelligence. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who has sought to instill greater financial discipline, is moving into a new role as president and chief investment officer, in which she will oversee a division that includes X.\n\n“She will put more heat into the kitchen and help drive success and viable businesses,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in an email.\n\nSince Google reorganized itself as a conglomerate in 2015, X’s moonshots have sought to “graduate” as Other Bets, or independent ventures under the banner of parent company Alphabet. But Alphabet could only accommodate so many Other Bets, creating a bottleneck for X ventures that were ready to take the next step, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. Startups within X often faced a choice between waiting for a spot to open up or striking out on their own.\n\nX employees had explored raising outside capital for their ventures in the past, but they ran into concerns from Alphabet leadership, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nIn addition to seeking venture capital, X has met with family offices, sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and strategic investors, or companies operating in the same industries that the moonshots are targeting, according to the people.\n\nSilicon Valley’s innovation labs have come under threat in a time of layoffs and budget cuts. Last year, Google slashed most jobs at Area 120, an in-house startup incubator. X cut some jobs last year but has refrained from making more significant changes until now.\n\n“This approach will give us more opportunity to focus on what Xers do best: inventing breakthrough technologies to help solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges,” Teller wrote in the note to staff. “Because the world needs moonshots more now than ever.”\n\n—With assistance from Sarah McBride, Mark Bergen and Sankalp Phartiyal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Help You Retire a Millionaire: 2024 Edition",
        "content": "Retiring a millionaire isn't just a goal for some investors, it's a necessity. Being a millionaire isn't what it was 30 years ago -- thanks to the dollar's devaluation -- but it still requires continual investing, with consistent deposits.\n\nWhile investing in the broader market is a surefire way to achieve this goal, buying individual stocks can increase your rate of return if you buy the correct ones. Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have the allure of providing unprecedented growth (just look at Nvidia), which attracts many investors.\n\nThe market is full of highly valued AI stocks right now, but I've identified three that look like strong candidates to beat the market over the long term, thanks to their reasonable valuations.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been heavily investing in AI for some time. While it has multiple AI tools, none is more important than its Gemini generative AI model. Generative AI represents the next iteration of search engine technology, as instead of looking for a topic and the user doing the summarizing, the engine does it for you.\n\nAlthough Alphabet stumbled out of the gate as Microsoft launched Bing's version of it (powered by Open AI's ChatGPT) well before Google's Bard, the latest generative AI model has massive potential. Gemini recently launched a new update that solidified itself as the top platform for building generative AI programs. It's the first model to outperform human experts in the massive multitask language understanding test and also other competitors in more specialized areas like reasoning, math, and code.\n\nAlphabet has yet to recognize revenue from this product, but it will come throughout 2024 and beyond as various companies build a generative AI solution on the Gemini platform.\n\nThis is exciting news for Alphabet, and many investors may want to get in on the action. Fortunately, Alphabet trades at a reasonable 22 times forward earnings -- much cheaper than many of its big-tech peers. With a strong upside and a fair stock price, Alphabet is well-positioned to accelerate your path to becoming a millionaire.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. UiPath\n\nPart of the allure of generative AI models is that it improves the user's speed and efficiency. UiPath's (NYSE: PATH) products are also in the same grain, as its RPA (robotic process automation) software is used to automate repetitive tasks, freeing employees up to do original thinking that computers and AI models cannot.\n\nTo function properly, UiPath needs a lot of data to ensure the process it's automating is done correctly. That's where AI comes in, as UiPath has multiple tools to mine for data within a business. Additionally, it can monitor employees to pinpoint repetitive tasks and flag those as a process that could be a candidate for automation.\n\nUiPath's solution is becoming increasingly popular, and the company has rapidly expanded. In Q3 FY 2024 (ending Oct. 31), UiPath's annual recurring revenue increased by 24% to $1.38 billion. However, the RPA market is expected to expand in the coming decade, as Polaris Market Research pinpoints the global RPA market to be $66 billion by 2032.\n\nWith that kind of growth ahead, coupled with UiPath trading at a reasonable 10 times sales, it's a no-brainer buy right now.\n\n3. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) may seem like an odd inclusion on a list of AI stocks. However, Airbnb has utilized AI for some time in its alternative stay and experience platform. In its early days, Airbnb was plagued by its reputation of being used only to find party houses. To improve its reputation and crack down on parties, Airbnb created an AI model that looks at several booking factors to determine how high of a chance the house could be used for a party.\n\nAdditionally, Airbnb purchased another AI platform known as GamePlanner.AI. Because this is a \"stealth\" company, the technology they developed remains a secret. However, GamePlanner.AI was led by Adam Cheyer and Siamak Hodjat, who created the Siri voice assistant for Apple.\n\nWith Airbnb ensuring AI is an integral part of its offering, it is an excellent AI investment right now. Throw in its price-to-free cash flow (its price-to-earnings ratio is currently skewed due to a one-time tax benefit) at an incredibly low level, and Airbnb is a strong candidate to be bought right now. ABNB Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nAll three of these companies are integrating AI into their systems and could easily crush the market over the next five years, further accelerating your path to becoming a millionaire.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

This stuff is just next level — one has to be entrenched in generative AI to truly get it, I think. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nWhat my simpleton self does know is this: 2024 will be the year of AI embedding itself into the very fabric of workplaces and the internet. In turn, this will be the year where many companies in the AI space swing from 2023 losses to profits.\n\nIt will be the year where big and powerful players such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) will get more powerful and profitable due to AI advances. These companies are attracting the best AI talent because they can afford to do so. This will widen their lead in the race to introduce game-changing AI products and services.\n\nHaving said all of this, maybe you understand AI better than me. I can appreciate that.\n\nHere are some of the sights and sounds on the AI front from WEF 2024, as Yahoo Finance Live was told.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorkday co-CEO Carl Eschenbach\n\n\"I think you'll start to see co-pilots.

We can start to look at recruiting as a way to leverage AI. And then we have this thing called a career insight hub that will help both managers and employees navigate their careers and give those recommendations on where you should go and get new skills to advance your career. And it will help them with internal mobility of your people.\"\n\nHP CEO Enrique Lores\n\n\"The AI PC is coming this year. And it's going be probably one of the biggest changes in the PC industry since the PC was invented more than 20 years ago. It'll allow customers to run AI applications locally. So what today you need to do in the cloud with a large language model, you will be able to do that in the PC. And from a cost, security, and speed perspective, it brings a lot of advantages.\"\n\nQualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon\n\n\"One big conversation right now is how we can help industries and what are the different use cases. And there's an incredible amount of interest in getting [AI] on the device. Just think about automotive as an example. Natural language communication is perfect when you are behind the wheel, and the car is now a new computing space. So how can we add those capabilities to some of the models, some that are in development with the existing hardware that we have.\"\n\nTech investor & Black Eyed Peas star will.i.am\n\n\"One project that I just launched with Mercedes is called Sound Drive that utilizes AI and transforms how we listen to music while we commute.

        "title": "These 5 Wildly Popular High-Flying Stocks of 2023 Could Be Duds in the Rest of 2024, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Over the long term, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return in the ballpark of 10%. When a given stock generates a return below that level it can be disappointing. That's especially the case for growth stocks for which investors have great expectations.\n\nSuch growth stocks led the charge last year, helping the major market indexes achieve big gains. Many analysts don't think you should look for a similar performance in the new year from all of them, though. These five wildly popular high-flying stocks of 2023 could be duds in the rest of 2024, according to Wall Street.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nThanks to a 57% return in 2023, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) ended the year just a hair away from becoming the most valuable company in the world based on market cap. The tech stock's modest rise in recent weeks has allowed it to claim the title, albeit just barely.\n\nHowever, Wall Street doesn't expect much more from Microsoft. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of less than 6%. The most pessimistic analyst thinks that Microsoft's share price could fall nearly 22%.\n\nValuation is one key concern. Microsoft's shares trade at a sky-high forward earnings multiple of 34.8.\n\n2. Apple\n\nYou can probably guess which company Microsoft knocked out of the No. 1 spot. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) reigned as the largest company in the world for several years. But the stock's 48% gain in 2023 wasn't enough to keep it on top after losing ground a little this month.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to continue to go neck-and-neck with Microsoft in the battle of market caps. The average 12-month price target for the stock is also less than 6% above its current price.\n\nThe main knock against Apple is its lack of growth. In its last reported quarter, the company's revenue slipped 1% year over year. Even with services revenue reaching an all-time high, Apple simply isn't delivering the growth that it has in the past.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that sizzled last year. Its shares skyrocketed 58% thanks in large part to the flurry of interest in generative AI.\n\nWall Street doesn't expect Alphabet's sizzle to completely fizzle in 2024. However, the consensus forecast is decidedly less enthusiastic than investors would like. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of just over 7%.\n\nSome investors could still be concerned about Google Cloud after Alphabet reported slowing growth for the unit in the third quarter of 2023. Others could worry that the U.S. economy won't have the soft landing that many economists predict, which could dampen Alphabet's advertising revenue growth.\n\n4. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) wowed investors in 2023 with its share price more than doubling. The company ramped up production of its electric vehicles and launched its Cybertruck.\n\nBut Wall Street doesn't predict nearly as big of a wow from Tesla this year. The average price target for the stock is nearly 8% above the current price. That's not bad, but it's a lot lower than investors would prefer. One especially bearish analyst even thinks that Tesla stock could plunge almost 90%.\n\nMost of the analyst ratings came before Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) that he wants to gain around 25% voting control of the company. Whether or not Musk achieves his goal -- and what it might mean for the stock -- remains to be seen.\n\n5. Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) is something of an outlier in this group. It isn't part of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The company doesn't have a clear connection with AI. However, Lilly was without question a wildly popular stock last year with its shares jumping 59%.\n\nAnalysts aren't looking for a wild performance from Lilly in 2024, though. The average 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of barely over 2%.\n\nAs was the case with Microsoft, valuation appears to be the primary issue for Wall Street with Lilly. The pharma stock's forward earnings multiple tops 51. That's a nosebleed level.\n\nIs Wall Street right about these stocks?\n\nI don't know if these five stocks will beat analysts' price targets or not. Wall Street could be right about the stocks' near-term prospects. However, it doesn't matter, in my opinion. What's important are the long-term prospects for each company.\n\nMy view is that AI will provide a strong tailwind for Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla over the next decade and beyond. I think that the opportunities for Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro, weight-loss drug Zepbound, and Alzheimer's disease drug donanemab (which awaits an approval decision) put its valuation in a much more favorable light.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me one bit if analysts revise their price targets upward for several, if not all, of these stocks in the coming months. Whether they do or not, I predict that all five will remain wildly popular in 2024 and for years to come -- for good reasons.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Turn $1,000 Into $2,000 by 2029",
        "content": "Growing your wealth over time can be easy work. Set up an investment portfolio that can deliver a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 15%. Let it run for five years if you're looking to double your money. So, if you put $1,000 into that investment, you'd have $2,000 by the end of 2029.\n\nNow, where can you find stocks promising to provide an average return of 15% per year for the next five years? First, you may not need a stock at all if an index-tracking exchange-traded fund (ETF) can get the job done.\n\nAn index fund tracking the venerable S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) probably wouldn't quite do it, for example. The CAGR for this market tracker worked out to 12.6% over the last five years and -- for investors who prefer basing their decisions on more reliable long-term statistics -- 8.1% in the last three decades. Sure beats the average interest rate on savings accounts, but it won't double your money in five years.\n\nThere are other index funds that seem likely to meet these goals, though. Switching to the more volatile bet on mostly tech stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index, the average return in five years lands at 20.6%. That's more than enough for my stated purposes. It's not a surefire guarantee, of course -- the truly long-term Nasdaq 100 return stops at 8.9% from a 30-year perspective. That's volatility from the dot-com bubble rearing its unexpected head three decades later.\n\nStill, a Nasdaq 100 tracker, such as the  Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), may deliver the desired return if the artificial intelligence (AI) boost of 2023 sticks around for a few more years. But this is one of those instances where hand-picked stocks might provide the returns that a more stable index fund probably can't. On that note, let me show you a couple of top-notch stocks that should see average five-year returns of 15% or more.\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) offer that rare combination of thrilling growth prospects and the proven flexibility to stay on that growth track for years and maybe even decades ahead. And they're not even expensive right now despite having gained more than 60% each in the last 52 weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nA proven winner with a flexible future\n\nAlphabet stands as a bastion of innovation in an ever-evolving digital landscape -- often leading from the front. The Google parent continues to push boundaries, especially in the realm of AI.\n\nEven its namesake search service can be seen as a form of AI, and the company keeps adding more digital smarts to its main business, with tools like natural language processing and sophisticated results-ranking algorithms based on deep learning analytics. Products such as Google Translate and the Google Maps navigation feature take the AI connection one step further, explicitly building the consumer experience around neural networks and machine learning systems.\n\nThe company's sustained revenue growth and strategic investments signal a future as dynamic as its past. The Alphabet umbrella structure lets the company try new and entirely different business ideas without confusing consumers expecting the Google brand to focus on online services. That's a stroke of flexible genius from 2015, among the first acts of CFO and financial heavyweight Ruth Porat, formerly the CFO of financial services giant Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is well within reason at 6.2 times trailing revenues, far below fellow AI experts such as Nvidia or Microsoft. All in all, Alphabet offers a compelling case for investors looking for a blend of stability and forward-thinking growth. Shareholders have enjoyed a CAGR of 21.4% for five years and 23.3% since the initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. That's a paragon of high-growth stability rarely seen in the tech sector or anywhere else.\n\nPast returns are no guarantee of future results, but Alphabet's history inspires plenty of confidence in the stock's future prospects. If you want to double your money in five years, this stock seems likely to deliver the goods.\n\nThe innovative powerhouse Jeff Bezos built\n\nAmazon's journey from an online bookstore to a diversified e-commerce and cloud computing behemoth shows its capacity to defy market boundaries.\n\nThe Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform didn't exactly invent cloud computing, but it was one of the first widely available cloud systems on a global scale. Started as an experimental way to squeeze some business value out of unused capacity in Amazon's e-commerce data centers, AWS has grown into the company's most profitable and fastest-growing arm. Its robust selection of AI tools should accelerate that trend in the years ahead.\n\nThe company's strategic investments in new technologies and markets, from healthcare to entertainment, reveal a bottomless appetite for growth. Founder Jeff Bezos famously expects Amazon to operate as if every day is \"day one\" for a brand-new upstart with limitless growth potential. Current CEO Andy Jassy has embraced the same philosophy, and it shows in Amazon's appetite for seemingly risky growth-boosting bets.\n\nFrom overnight and same-day shipping to cloud-based AI tools and the innovative Amazon Market platform for independent retailers, Amazon has a long history of investing billions of dollars in promising growth boosters. Not every swing is a home run, as proven by disappointments such as the forgettable Fire Phone and Amazon Auctions projects. However, the big wins more than make up for a few misses along the way.\n\nIf Amazon keeps up this growth-oriented attitude and impressive hit ratio for another five years, I don't see why the annual stock returns would fall below 15%. There may not be any guarantees in the stock market, but an Amazon investment at 2.9 times sales comes close. Like Alphabet, Amazon looks poised to double your money in five short years.\n\nThere you have it -- two stocks and one ETF that should double your money by 2029. Any combination of Amazon, Alphabet, and the Invesco QQQ Trust should help you achieve that goal and build your wealth well beyond that modest target.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "5 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "In 2023, numerous technology names made a dramatic comeback following a brutal bear market in 2022. For the year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 43%. However, many stocks experienced triple-digit increases, leaving some investors questioning whether they could still find affordable stocks.\n\nFortunately, many value stocks stayed inexpensive despite the industry's strong performance, and those looking for a bargain may want to consider these five tech stocks in particular.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) performed well in 2023, but a new technology led some investors to question the company's future role in tech. OpenAI's ChatGPT introduced a generative AI tool that reinvigorated artificial intelligence, and its alliance with Microsoft made many investors wonder whether users would abandon Google in favor of Bing.\n\nNonetheless, Alphabet has introduced a competing generative AI tool called Gemini, a sign the company has no plans to surrender competitively. Moreover, Alphabet's $120 billion in liquidity gives it the resources needed to remain competitive in AI. Additionally, at a P/E ratio of 27, it is the cheapest of the so-called \"magnificent seven\" stocks, making it a more compelling buy as it works to win over AI investors again.\n\n2. Intel\n\nLike IBM, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) suffered for years after falling behind competitively. However, CEO Pat Gelsinger aimed to reclaim its technical lead and become a leading chip producer.\n\nTo this end, its Emerald Rapids and Meteor Lake processors have come a long way in closing Intel's competitive gap with AMD. Also, Intel Foundry Services has attracted many of tech's top businesses as clients.\n\nAdmittedly, Intel posted negative free cash flow for the year as it invested tens of billions in improvements. But free cash flow turned positive in the third quarter, and with the stock selling at just 16 times earnings, investors could find themselves wishing they had bought shares as it reclaims some of its competitive advantages.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. IBM\n\nIBM (NYSE: IBM) had become an afterthought in tech as its businesses became stagnant. However, buying Red Hat in 2019 and redefining itself as a cloud and supercomputing company has breathed new life into the venerable tech giant. Furthermore, it spun off its managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl, showing a willingness to part with underperforming assets.\n\nDespite struggles, IBM maintains a growing payout with a 4% dividend yield, and its $5.1 billion free cash flow in the first nine months of 2023 covered $4.5 billion in dividend costs. With a P/E ratio of just 22 and a return to a growth trajectory, IBM is well positioned to deliver market-beating returns.\n\n4. PagSeguro\n\nPagSeguro Digital(NYSE: PAGS) is not a familiar name to American investors. Nonetheless, the Brazil-based fintech company has stood out for offering a unique financial product. Its platform serves as a digital wallet comparable to PayPal's Venmo that can also act as a checking account for Brazilian consumers and businesses. Additionally, it provides point-of-sale services and prepaid cards.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2023, free cash flow came in at 368 million reais ($75 million), up from a negative 169 million reais in the same year-ago period. With the international stock showing signs of recovery and a P/E ratio of 13, investors have both a bargain price and the catalyst needed to drive significant returns.\n\n5. Verizon\n\nCompetition, legacy costs, and capital expenditures have hampered Verizon's (NYSE: VZ) stock for years. While it is one of three nationwide 5G providers, keeping up with technological change while maintaining its network quality rating has come at a high cost.\n\nHowever, the rise of AI and IoT makes Verizon's network a more vital part of the U.S. communications infrastructure. Moreover, investors receive a 6.8% dividend yield, and since free cash flow for the first nine months of 2023 rose 18% to $15 billion, the telecom stock covered the $8 billion in dividend costs. At a P/E ratio of 8, this is a bargain income investors should not ignore.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "10 Top Rated Blue Chip Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are In Love With: January 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten top rated blue chip stocks Wall Street analysts are in love with in January 2024. If you want to skip our latest stock market coverage and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then you can read 5 Top Rated Blue Chip Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are In Love With: January 2024.\n\nWith 2024 officially in full flow, the stock markets are performing well. The NASDAQ 100 index is trading at all-time high level, and the S&P 500 joined it on January 19th when it touched 4,804 and crossed its previous all-time high reading of 4,796 recorded two years ago.\n\nThe market as a whole appears to be entering 2024 with cautious optimism. Throughout 2023, investors battled with the Federal Reserve and economic data to time their bets and decipher Mr. Market's moves. Now, investors are trying to figure out whether the Federal Reserve's optimism through its interest rate hiking cycle in 2023 will prove warranted. The economy is performing well, in an interesting conundrum. While economic growth is always welcomed by the market, this time around, it accompanies concerns that perhaps a robust economy will also mean that the Fed feels comfortable keeping interest rates higher for longer.\n\nThroughout the interest rate hiking cycle, and especially last year, the Fed has maintained that a soft landing for the U.S. economy might be on the horizon. What this means is that while interest rate increases will slow down growth, there won't be a recession.  Should this be the case, then the pain for consumers in the form of job losses can be mitigated.\n\nYet, even if the economy doesn't tip into recession, the system is already under stress from high interest rates. The start of the year has marked earnings reports from banks, and the consensus on that front is that while interest income is at all time high levels, bank deposit costs are also growing much faster than belt tightening managers would like. Some of the offending banks on this list are M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY). Discovery, known for its digital banking services that provide branch less banking and loans, saw its net income plummet to $388 million during the fourth quarter from a sizeable year ago figure of $1 billion. At the core of this massive drop was an uncertain lending environment due to high rates. This forced Discovery to allocate more funds to risky loans in its portfolio, which ended up affecting the income statement. M&T and KeyCorp bother suffered from higher deposit costs. These led M&T to report a 6% drop in its net interest income, with KeyCorp's NII plummeting by a sizeable 24%.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting from banks, technology stocks are off to a good start this year. One of the most widely talked about technology industries in the world is the semiconductor industry, and January saw a lot of optimism from the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). TSMC reported its fourth quarter of 2023 earnings, and at the accompanying analyst call, the firm's management expressed confidence that it could capture the market for A.I. chips.\n\nTSMC's CEO Dr. C.C. Wei shared at the firm's fourth quarter of 2023 earnings call:\n\nNo matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models as the amount of computation required for training and inference is increasing.\n\nAs a result, AI models need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing, and we are all well positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI. To address insatiable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading edge process technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering.\n\nTSMC's optimism about A.I. coupled with Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) raising its second quarter of fiscal 2024 guidance by a cool $700 million is proving beneficial to technology stocks and the semiconductor sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up by a healthy 5.8% over the past five days, mirroring the performance of broader stock indexes.\n\nAmidst this cautiously optimistic environment that's seeing investors eager to not miss out on potential future trends, we thought to take a look at some top rated blue chip stocks that Wall Street analysts are in love with. Some stocks that Wall Street analysts love that might catch your eye are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 10 Top Rated Blue Chip Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are In Love With: January 2024\n\nA robotic process automation system in a modern datacenter.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Wall Street analysts are in love with, we ranked all U.S. based companies with market capitalization greater than $50 billion and more than $5 billion in annual revenue by their average analyst share ratings. Naturally, the companies with the highest average ratings are also those that Wall Street analysts think are great. The lower the score, the higher rated the stock is by Wall Street analysts.\n\nFor these stocks we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Roar Higher in 2024: 2 Revolutionary AI Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "The past isn't exactly a crystal ball. But sometimes, a look back in time can offer us clues about what might happen in the future. You can apply this to investing by looking back at an index's past performance and noticing patterns that may repeat themselves today or in the future. And by doing this right now, you'll see history calls for the Nasdaq Composite to roar higher in 2024.\n\nSince the index's launch in the early 1970s, as part of every rebound from an annual decline, it's gained for at least two consecutive years. And after each annual loss of 10% or more, the Nasdaq climbed an average of 56% over those two years. Considering the Nasdaq advanced 43% last year, if the index follows its routine of the past, it could be heading for another double-digit increase in 2024.\n\nHow could you as an investor benefit from a soaring Nasdaq? By investing in companies that contribute the most to the index's movement -- such as the top 10 most heavily weighted in the index -- and then narrowing that down to companies offering exciting growth prospects now. And that brings me to two companies set to lead in artificial intelligence (AI), a market forecast to reach more than $1.3 trillion by 2030. Let's check out two revolutionary AI stocks to buy before the Nasdaq rockets higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) started out by conquering the gaming and graphics marketplaces thanks to its graphics processing units (GPU) -- and that's driven earnings gains over time. But in recent years, the rest of the world discovered the power of GPUs, and Nvidia's sales and share price have taken off.\n\nThese powerful chips handle multiple tasks at the same time, by dividing the work among many processors, and as a result, they significantly speed things up. And that makes Nvidia's GPUs an essential AI tool, serving as the engine for the \"deep learning\" involved in generative AI. As a result, industries from healthcare to automotive are turning to Nvidia chips to drive their AI programs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Nvidia's revenue soared to a record of $18 billion, led by record data center revenue -- the business that benefits from the booming AI market. Data center revenue surged 279% to more than $14 billion. Operating income of $10 billion well surpassed operating expenses, another positive point -- and at the same time, increasing research and development spending shows Nvidia is investing to stay ahead of the crowd.\n\nThe important metrics of free cash flow and return on invested capital have climbed over the past year, proof Nvidia is deploying its cash wisely and benefiting from those investments. NVDA Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nToday, Nvidia holds more than 80% of the GPU market, and though rivals have multiplied, I'm confident this leader will continue to dominate. That's because the company has the first-to-market advantage and a top product, and loyal fans of Nvidia's GPU performance may not be tempted to switch.\n\nA trend in the central processing unit (CPU) market illustrates this. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has grown its share in the CPU market for laptops to 22% over the period of a decade, according to Statista -- but, during that time, it hasn't been able to unseat leader Intel, which holds 69% of the market. All of this means AMD, also present in the GPU market, could gain in share over time -- but without necessarily disturbing Nvidia's dominance.\n\nYes, Nvidia shares have soared in recent times, but the company's earnings growth, market leadership, and key role in AI means there's plenty of room for gains. And a stock market environment favoring growth also should favor Nvidia, making it a top stock to buy before the Nasdaq soars.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is central to our daily lives thanks to its popular search engine, Google. The company generates most of its revenue by selling ads to those who aim to get our attention as we search for various types of information online. Advertisers flock to Alphabet because Google, as you probably could guess, dominates the search market. It's consistently held more than 90% share, and for two big reasons, I wouldn't expect that to change.\n\nFirst, it's hard to change a routine -- and that means most of us are likely to keep \"Googling\" our questions rather than try out a rival search engine. So, Alphabet here has a moat, or competitive advantage that could keep it ahead.\n\nSecond, Alphabet has been significantly investing in AI to make its search capabilities better and better -- this should please us, the users, and as a result we'll keep coming back. And that means advertisers will keep coming back to Alphabet too.\n\nThe company recently announced a big step forward along its AI path when it launched Gemini, its biggest and most high-performing AI model yet. Gemini operates across information types, from text to code and image and video. And Gemini models -- in three different sizes -- tackle various tasks including answering questions on complex topics and generating code in popular programing languages.\n\nIt's clear Gemini could improve the Google Search experience and search results down the road, ensuring Alphabet's dominance. And Alphabet also is adding Gemini to its other products -- such as its Pixel smartphone -- and making Gemini available to its cloud customers. So, this AI tool could be a game-changer for Alphabet as it improves the performance of the company's products and services and allows cloud clients to benefit from the technology.\n\nOn top of this, Alphabet already has a solid track record of earnings growth over time. And the company managed to maintain quarterly revenue increases last year even as advertisers cut back on spending. In the most recent quarter, Alphabet reported an 11% increase in revenue and gains in operating income and earnings per share.\n\nAll of this means if the Nasdaq rockets higher in 2024, AI giant Alphabet could be among stocks leading the way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Investors to Follow on Twitter and Social Media.\n\nMorgan Stanley Bullish on Diversified, Alpha Hedge Fund Portfolios\n\nOn December 31, 2023, Morgan Stanley reported that falling inflation levels are expected to be sluggishly above bank targets ahead of 2024. Such may lead to price dispersion and provide hedge fund alpha opportunities across asset classes. Throughout 2024, the Fed is expected to ease monetary policy which may eventually push wide discrepancies among winners and losers. While an easing cycle coupled with higher interest rates may increase volatility in bond prices, hedge funds may be able to benefit from higher interest rates, especially with derivative-based investing strategies. Morgan Stanley is bullish on diversified and alpha hedge fund portfolios in the current environment. The market is uncertain and the outlook for 2024 seems unclear, which may be a hint towards avoiding big and risky bets.\n\nTop Stock Picks of Hedge Funds\n\nInstitutional investors are heavily positioned in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc.

To commence with our research we first established certain parameters to define a niche for our list. Therefore, our list consists of popular hedge fund managers that primarily own a Twitter account, and other social media channels if available. We first consulted four reports on the internet including Forbes, Benzinga, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance. We then applied certain filters on LinkedIn using keywords such as \"hedge fund manager\" to ensure we did not miss any important names. Finally, we also looked up founding members and owners of popular hedge funds. This thorough process enabled us to come up with 55 hedge fund managers. We then conducted a manual search to find the Twitter account of every investor along with other social media such as LinkedIn and Instagram, if available. Moreover, we consulted Forbes to extract profiles and the net worth of each investor.\n\nIt is to be noted that while we intended to include hedge fund managers with a significant social media presence, some of the most popular names in the hedge fund industry do not own Twitter accounts. For such investors, we have ranked them earlier in the list based on their social media presence on any other social media site such as Linkedin, Instagram, or YouTube.

        "title": "2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Tech stocks have a reputation for delivering significant and consistent gains over the long term. The innovative nature of the market has created an ever-expanding environment and one of the best places to invest.\n\nThe chart below illustrates this, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector rising significantly higher over the last decade than the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500. ^NDXT Chart\n\nWall Street has grown particularly bullish about tech stocks over the last year thanks to advances in budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. And these industries appear to be only just getting started.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector posted a gain of 55% year over year, but could have a lot more to offer new investors going forward. Here are two tech stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is probably already on your radar as a potential investment. The company has a powerful role in tech, with positions in search engines, online video sharing, cloud computing, digital advertising, and more.\n\nIn fact, Alphabet boasts nine products with more than 1 billion users, with the top three being Google Search, Android, and Chrome. The success of its various services has seen Alphabet's annual revenue soar 75% since 2019 and its operating income rise 108%, outperforming competitors Microsoft and Apple in both metrics.\n\nWhile Alphabet is probably best known for its role in search engines, its main business lies in digital advertising. The tech giant's massive user base presents almost endless advertising opportunities, with Alphabet responsible for an estimated 27% of the $740 billion market.\n\nAdvertising spending dipped slightly alongside macroeconomic headwinds in 2022. However, Alphabet's third quarter of 2023 suggests the market is back on track. The company's revenue was up 11% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $980 million. Growth was mainly owed to an 11% increase in Google Search revenue and a 12% rise in its YouTube Ads segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is on a promising growth trajectory, topping $77 billion in free cash flow last year. The company has vast financial resources, which it is employing to invest heavily in AI. The company unveiled a highly anticipated AI model called Gemini last December, and has plans to venture into the chip market. Alphabet has the brand power and significant cash reserves to see big gains from AI over the long term. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart shows Alphabet is potentially one of the biggest bargains in tech right now. Its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow are lower than those of some of the most prominent tech firms, indicating its stock offers the most value.\n\nAlongside a consistently expanding business, Alphabet is among the best tech stocks for long-haul investors.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was hit particularly hard by an economic downturn in 2022, with its stock plunging 50% throughout the year alongside steep declines in its e-commerce profits. However, the company delivered an impressive turnaround in 2023, which proved why its stock is one of the best long-term investments.\n\nShares of Amazon rose more than 80% last year as its retail business returned to profitability and its cloud platform expanded in AI. After a challenging 2022, the company started restructuring its business with a priority on profit growth.\n\nCost-cutting measures such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, thousands of layoffs, and sunsetting unprofitable divisions like Amazon Care have seen the tech firm's free cash flow soar 427% over the last year.\n\nIn Q3 2023, Amazon posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, outperforming analysts' forecasts by $1.5 billion. Much of the growth came from its retail business. Its North American segment hit over $4 billion operating income, significantly improving on the $412 million in losses it posted in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAmazon's ability to successfully navigate economically challenging conditions has made it one of the most reliable stocks in tech. Meanwhile, its highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, and its heavy investment in AI will likely keep its shares trending up for decades.\n\nAmazon's stock is made more attractive by its price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 2.9. This metric is calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its trailing 12-month revenue. The lower the figure, the more value a stock offers. Compared to Microsoft and Apple's P/S ratios of 13 and 7, Amazon is a bargain and an excellent long-term buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Today, Still Below Their 2021 Highs",
        "content": "2023 has come and gone, leaving the stock market's tech sector buzzing with the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Some stocks have skyrocketed in response to the AI-based sea change, but a few were left behind -- and not always for good reason.\n\nThree of The Motley Fool's top tech experts got together to share their most affordable AI plays in this market. Read on for the straight dope on their clear-eyed picks: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Applied Materials(NASDAQ: AMAT). All three are trading significantly below their all-time highs of 2021, and they are hungry for a comeback in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSomeone needs to make all those AI chips, you know\n\nAnders Bylund (Taiwan Semiconductor): Semiconductor-making giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (often called TSMC) has been through a lot in the last couple of years, and most of the changes have been helpful.\n\nThe global shortage in semiconductor manufacturing capacity that started in 2021 effectively ended at the tail end of 2023. The inflation pressure that held back consumer-level demand for hot-off-the-electronics-factory gear such as new cars and smartphones also fell back. TSMC started construction of several new manufacturing facilities in places like Arizona, Japan, and China, slated to open between 2024 and 2026. If this capacity increase doesn't put the final nail in the shortage's proverbial coffin, I don't know what it takes. The company arguably held on to its chip-making technology lead despite fresh competition from Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), aiming for test runs of the 2-nanometer process node in 2025. The three largest chip foundries are running neck-and-neck in the eternal race to provide the world's most advanced manufacturing process, cramming in more processors per silicon wafer with real benefits to both production cost and processing performance.\n\nGranted, the sailing wasn't all smooth. Intel's unexpected entrance on the third-party manufacturing stage added new headwinds to TSMC's business. Ongoing political tensions between China and America don't help either, though the company is working around the problem by positioning new facilities far away from the Chinese sphere of influence, such as Arizona.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut I'm still talking about a dominant player in an important industry, with tremendous growth prospects as the world economy wriggles out of the inflation-tinted straitjacket it donned in 2021. Taiwan Semiconductor's stock trades at merely 15 times forward earnings and 8.4 times sales. Share prices stand approximately 20% below their all-time highs, recorded in February of 2021 and again in January 2022.\n\nI've been a fan of Taiwan Semi and its stock for decades. The company never ceases to surprise me with its iron-fisted grip on the chip-making market and terrific financial results. The stock has gained roughly 1,000% since I first looked into it in 2006, quadrupling the returns of the S&P 500 market index over that span -- and after all that, TSMC's stock still looks affordable and poised for further growth right now.\n\nThe chip industry should experience a glut of orders as companies of every stripe search for a foothold in the explosive AI industry, keeping TSMC's production lines more than busy for years to come. So I highly recommend grabbing a few TSMC shares before the stock price takes off again.\n\nE-commerce is so back, and the cloud will follow suit in 2024\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Amazon): Many investors found solace after the bear market with a \"flight to safety\" to the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks: Big tech platforms that kept growing and outperformed the market overall in 2023.\n\nHowever, not all the Mag7 have been all that magnificent in recent years. Take Amazon, for example, which remains nearly 20% down from the all-time highs last set in late 2021.\n\nI believe 2024 could be the year Amazon finally achieves those peaks again. The e-commerce and cloud computing leader is in the midst of a multiyear process of right-sizing its operations to boost profitability. In e-commerce, it's been filling its distribution centers with robotics for years. And in a further push to monetize its marketplace, Amazon has been rolling out advertising features for third-party merchants. Amazon already optimizes ads using AI, and late in 2023, it introduced AI-generated images for its marketers to use for promoting products.\n\nAnd on the cloud computing side (where Amazon Web Services is still the cloud market leader), Amazon has reported that its customer spending seems to be solidifying after a year of trying to cut costs and conserve cash. And though it was late to the generative AI party, Amazon Web Services has been installing Nvidia GPUs into its data centers as well to keep pace with the times.\n\nIndeed, even outside research indicates that the cloud market is poised for a monster year in 2024. Tech researcher Gartner thinks global cloud spending will rise 20% this year to around $680 billion. That could be a portent of good things to come for Amazon stock.\n\nAmazon currently trades for about 28 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for 2024 free cash flow -- which implies this profit metric could skyrocket about 50% this year as Amazon's optimization work starts to pay off. I remain a buyer of Amazon stock at these levels.\n\nBilly Duberstein (Applied Materials): Applied Materials is only about 10% below its late 2021 highs, but look for this all-star semiconductor leader to break that resistance level and eventually move higher.\n\nApplied's business has a terrific combination of growth, profitability, and shareholder returns that should allow it to compound earnings well into the future. And compound earnings is the recipe for eventual new highs in the stock market.\n\nApplied's great financial characteristics come from it being the most diversified semiconductor equipment company in the world, with leadership in several key technologies spanning leading-edge chips, lagging-edge specialty chips, and memory.\n\nThat diversification was on full display over the past year, when Applied's leading-edge and memory equipment sales went into a downturn. However, sales of lagging-edge specialty equipment usually used for producing auto and industrial chips remained strong. So while front-end wafer fab equipment is projected to decline about 15% in 2023 according to industry group SEMI, Applied actually managed to grow its semiconductor equipment sales 4.8% in its last fiscal year.\n\nWhile impressive, some investors believe the previously strong industrial and auto sectors are now going into their downturn, so Applied's stock has plateaued a bit in recent months. But Applied's leading-edge tools, especially for AI chips and high-bandwidth memory, should get a boost in the near future.\n\nIn a recent analyst note last week, analysts at Keybanc Capital markets boosted their outlook for several AI-related stocks based on current channel checks. While Applied wasn't one of the stocks upgraded, its leading-edge tools do help produce the chips from each of the three stocks highlighted. So leading-edge tool growth should offset any weakness in the specialty sector. That's especially true as IDC projects the overall semiconductor market to bounce back with 20% growth in 2024.\n\nMoreover, Applied isn't resting on its laurels. It's a forward-thinking company perpetually looking for new growth avenues and the next major technology breakthrough. For instance, the company is currently looking to apply its atomic-level manufacturing talents to augmented reality. This past week, Applied and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) announced a collaboration for multiple generations of Google's new lightweight augmented reality glasses platform. And last year, Applied announced it would be investing $4 billion in its groundbreaking EPIC R&D center. The EPIC center will be a nexus of collaboration between university researchers, Applied, and the company's chipmaking customers to speed up the pace of innovation.\n\nApplied's profitability allows it to invest in new ventures like these, somewhat future-proofing its business, all while returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and a rising dividend. It shouldn't stay below its all-time high much longer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: My Top 7 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "The macroeconomic challenges of the past couple of years are beginning to fade, and investors are looking to the future. After the Nasdaq Composite plunged in 2022, suffering its worst performance since 2008, the index enjoyed a robust recovery in 2023 and gained 43%.\n\nThere could be more to come. Since the Nasdaq Composite began trading in 1972, in every year following a market recovery, the tech-heavy index rose again -- and those second-year gains averaged 19%. The economy is the wildcard here, though, and it could yet stumble in 2024. But historical patterns suggest that this could be a good year for investors.\n\nRecent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) helped fuel the market's rise last year and will likely drive further gains in 2024. While estimates vary wildly, generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the next few years, according to a study by McKinsey Global Institute. This will result in windfalls for many companies in the field.\n\nHere are my top seven AI stocks to buy for 2024 before the Nasdaq reaches new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster child for AI innovation. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are already the industry standard chips in a growing number of AI use cases -- including data centers, cloud computing, and machine learning -- and it quickly adapted its processors for the needs of generative AI. Though it has been ramping up production, the AI chip shortage is expected to last until 2025 as demand keeps growing. The specter of competition looms, but thus far, Nvidia has stayed ahead of the competition by spending heavily on research and development.\n\nThe company's triple-digit percentage year-over-year growth is expected to continue into 2024. Despite its prospects, Nvidia remains remarkably cheap, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) helped jump-start the AI boom when it invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, shining a spotlight on generative AI. The company's tech peers jumped on the bandwagon, and the AI gold rush began. Microsoft seized the advantage, integrating OpenAI's technology into its Bing search and a broad cross-section of its cloud-based offerings.\n\nIts productivity-enhancing AI assistant, Copilot, could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027, according to some analysts, though estimates vary. This and other AI tools already caused Azure Cloud's growth to outpace rivals in Q3, and Microsoft attributed 3 percentage points of that growth to AI.\n\nThe stock is selling for 35 times forward earnings, a slight premium to the price-to-earnings ratio of 26 for the S&P 500. Even so, that looks attractive given Microsoft's growth potential.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has long used AI to improve its search results and the relevance of its digital advertising. The company was quick to recognize the potential of generative AI, imbuing many of its Google and Android products with increased functionality and announcing plans to add new AI tools to its search product. Furthermore, as the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider, Google Cloud is suited to offer AI systems to its customers.\n\nA collaboration between Google and Alphabet's AI research lab, DeepMind, gave birth to Gemini, which the company bills as its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Google Cloud's Vertex AI offers 130 foundational models that help users build and deploy generative AI apps quickly.\n\nAdd to that the ongoing rebound in its digital advertising business, and Alphabet's valuation of 27 times earnings seems like a steal.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nThere's a popular narrative that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was late to recognize the opportunities in AI, but the company's history tells a different story. Amazon continues to deploy AI to surface relevant products to shoppers, recommend viewing choices on Prime Video, schedule e-commerce deliveries, and predict inventory levels, among other uses. Most recently, Amazon began testing an AI tool designed to answer shoppers' questions about products.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) stocks all the most popular generative AI models for its cloud customers on Bedrock AI, and is also deploying its Inferentia and Trainium purpose-built AI chips for accelerating AI on its infrastructure.\n\nNow that inflation has slowed markedly, more consumers and businesses are patronizing Amazon, and AI will help boost its fortunes. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) also has a long and distinguished history of using AI to its advantage. From identifying and tagging people in photos to surfacing relevant content on its social media platforms, Meta has never been shy about deploying AI systems.\n\nUnlike some of its big tech rivals, Meta doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service to peddle its AI wares, but it quickly developed a workaround. After developing its open-source Llama AI model, Meta made it available on all the major cloud services -- for a price. Furthermore, Meta offers a suite of free AI-powered tools to help advertisers succeed.\n\nImproving economic conditions will no doubt boost its digital advertising business. And with the stock trading at just 22 times forward earnings, Meta is inexpensive relative to its opportunity.\n\n6. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has two decades of experience building AI-powered data analytics, and was ready to meet the challenge when AI went mainstream. In just months, the company added generative AI models to its portfolio, layering these atop its data analytics tools. The launch of the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has generated a lot of excitement. \"Demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past 20 years,\" said management.\n\nWhen fears of a downturn were higher, businesses scaled back on most nonessential spending, including data analytics and AI services, but now, demand for those services is rebounding, particularly in relation to generative AI.\n\nLooking ahead one year, Palantir sports a PEG ratio of less than 1, which helps illustrate how cheap the stock really is.\n\n7. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) made a splash by bringing electric vehicles (EVs) into the mainstream. In 2023, its Model Y topped the list of the world's best-selling cars by a comfortable margin, the first EV to do so. However, the magnitude of its future prosperity will likely be linked to AI. The company's \"full self-drive\" system has yet to live up to its name, but success on that front would be a boon to shareholders.\n\nIn Ark Investment Management's Big Ideas 2023 report, the firm estimates that robotaxis could generate $4 trillion in revenue in 2027. With an estimated 2.7 million vehicles on the road collecting data, Tesla could hold an insurmountable technological edge, if it cracks the code on autonomous driving. Some analysts estimate the software is already worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nFinally, 6 times forward sales is a pretty reasonable valuation for an industry leader with a treasure trove of data.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

To see more such companies, click Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: 5 Companies Bezos Is Investing In.\n\nRising interest rates and overall macroeconomic volatility kept a lid on startup funding in 2023 as investors remained in a wait and see mode about the future and preferred to invest in safe and already mature companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). A detailed report on the state of venture capital and future predictions from Cambridge Associates cited data from PitchBook which said that median change in valuations for follow-on financing rounds for early-stage companies in 2023 was 1.7x, the lowest change in any year since 2016. However, the Cambridge Associates report said that while 2023 was a bad year, low investments in 2022 and 2023 means there would be ample capital for VC funds to invest in worthy startups in 2024. The report also said most of the venture capital investments in 2024 would be directed towards AI. While Cambridge Associates said AI is not a new thing, it expects that the huge advancements in the domain after the generative AI boom would result in real innovation growth in the next few years.\n\nJeff Bezos' Thoughts on Innovation\n\nBut for innovation-focused billionaires like Jeff Bezos, who is worth about $177 billion as of January 20, the state of venture capital markets and what could happen in the next few months rarely matters. In an interview with senior tech writer Peter Burrows, Bezos said that there's no \"bad time\" to innovate when asked about Bezos' history of getting criticized for spending extravagantly on innovation.\n\n\"You should be doing it when times are good and when times are tough—and you want to be  doing it around things that your customers care about.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFood technology. Environment. Biotech. AI. Neurotechnology. These are the main themes in Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy as evident from his long list of investments.\n\nWhat matters to Bezos, according to him, is that his company is truly focusing on innovation and he tries not to get bogged down by stock price movements.\n\n\"We have three all-hands meetings a year, and I'll tell people that if the stock is up 30% this month, please don't feel you are 30% smarter. Because when the stock is down 30% a month from now, it's not going to feel that good to feel 30% dumber. When the Internet bubble burst, our stock went from over 100 a share to a low right after September 11 of 6. Throughout that entire period, the fundamentals of the business continuously improved. You can see the stock price going in the opposite direction of the fundamentals. So it wasn't that worrisome to us, \" Bezos said in the interview with Burrows.\n\nWhile Amazon's success over the years has proved that Bezos's innovation philosophy is right, it's interesting to take a look at the top investments of Jeff Bezos' investment company Bezos Expeditions. Billionaires like Bezos are always on the lookout to find new, promising startups in emerging domains that can grow to become giants in the future like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: Companies Bezos Is Investing In\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we took a look at Bezos Expeditions, Pitchbook, TechCrunch and some other reliable sources to find out which startups Bezos has been investing in. From these companies we selected 11 important companies in which Bezos invested in over the past few years. We gave preference to Bezos' most recent investments.\n\n11. Anthropic\n\nEven though Jeff Bezos is not a direct investor in Anthropic, the company behind ChatGPT rival AI assistant Claude, Anthropic deserves an entry in our list since Amazon decided to invest up to $4 billion in the company in 2023. According to the deal, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will initially invest $1.25 billion in Anthropic  and the investment would later be increased to $4 billion.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) management talked about Anthropic in its Q3 earnings call:\n\nRecently, we announced that leading LLM maker Anthropic chose AWS as its primary cloud provider and will use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train and deploy its future LLMs. As part of this partnership, AWS and Anthropic will collaborate on the future development of Trainium and Inferentia technology. We believe this collaboration will be helpful in continuing to accelerate the price performance advantages that Trainium and Inferentia deliver for customers. In the middle layer which we think of as large language models as a service, we recently introduced general availability for Amazon Bedrock which offers customers access to leading LLMs from third-party providers like Anthropic, Stability AI, coherent AI 21 as well as from Amazon’s own LLMs called Titan, where customers can take those models, customize them using their own data but without leaking that data back into the generalized LLM, have access to the same security, access control and features that they run the rest of their applications within AWS all through a managed service.\n\nIn the last couple of months, we’ve announced the imminent addition of Meta’s Llama 2 model to Bedrock, the first time it’s being made available through a fully managed service. Also through our expanded collaboration with Anthropic, customers will gain access to future Anthropic models through Bedrock with exclusive early access to unique features, model customization and the ability to fine-tune the models. And Bedrock has added several new compelling features, including the ability to create agents which can be programmed to accomplish tasks like answering questions or automating workflows. In these early days of generative AI, companies are still learning which models they want to use which models they use for what purposes and which model sizes they should use to get the latency and cost characteristics they desire.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n10. Synchron\n\nNeurotechnology and brain  Synchron ranks 10th in our list of the companies Jeff Bezos has been investing in.  In 2022, Synchron raised $75 million in a funding round led by ARCH Venture Partners. In addition to Bezos Expeditions, Bill Gates' investment firm also took part in the round. Last year it was reported that Synchron was testing a technology (The Synchron Switch) that would allow people with no or very limited physical mobility to operate technology such as cursors or smart devices using their mind.\n\n9. Arrived Homes\n\nIn a budget as little as $100, you can own a property and then rent it out. That's the promise and business model of Arrived Homes, a fractional real estate platform company which raised about $160 million in funding and debt financing, including two infusions from Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions.\n\nLast year, Arrived Homes launched the Arrived Single Family Residential Fund which would allow investors to invest on their own schedule without having to wait for individual properties to launch.\n\n8. NotCO\n\nNotCo is a Chilean food technology company that uses algorithms and AI to find out the best combinations of plants to create alternatives to animal-based foods.\n\nIn 2022, NotCo raised another $70 million in fresh funding, led by Princeville Capital. Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions, which had already invested in the firm, again took part in the new funding round, along with Tiger Global, L Catterton, Kaszek Ventures and MercadoLibre CEO Marcos Galperin.\n\n7. Cloud Paper\n\nCloud Paper is one of the most unique names in the list of companies Jeff Bezos has been investing in. Cloud Paper aims to impact the traditional paper industry. Cloud Paper makes bamboo-based tree-free toilet paper which it sources from \"responsibly-managed forests.\"\n\nIn 2022, Cloud Paper raised $5 million in a funding round in which Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions took part. Cloud Paper planned to launch commercial-size toilet paper and touchless dispensers. While major companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) always steal the show because of their clout and size in the investing space, wise investors are always on the lookout to find smaller, promising companies like Cloud Paper to invest in.\n\n6. Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN)\n\nCalifornia-based EV company Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) ranks 6th in our list of the top Jeff Bezos investments in 2024. According to some reports Amazon owns about 10% to 15% stake in Rivian.\n\nIn 2019, Amazon signed a deal with Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) to have at least 100,000 electric delivery vans for itself on the road by 2030.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) during this period was Daniel Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners which owns a $327 million stake in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN).\n\nIn addition to Rivian, hedge funds are also investing heavily in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHere is what Baron Global Advantage Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc., a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer, continued their volatile trading, and after declining during the first half of 2023, rose 45.7% during the third quarter. Rivian’s unit economics are improving as a result of several factors: i) the company’s production rate is increasing, which enables it to better absorb fixed costs; ii) Rivian is ramping-up the usage of more price effective technologies, such as LFP batteries and its in-house developed motor, Enduro; and iii) the company is benefiting from renegotiated supplier agreements, as its scale and purchasing power have significantly increased over the last few years. Management expects continued progress in profitability ahead as Rivian further scales production. We remain shareholders and believe that the release of Rivian’s new smaller SUV dubbed R2, which is planned for early 2024, would enable the company to compete in the higher volume SUV segment, and significantly expand its addressable market. On the liquidity front, we expect the company to raise additional funds to support its longer-term business plans.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: 5 Companies Bezos Is Investing In.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 High-Growth Canadian Dividend Stocks To Invest In 14 Money Making Stocks To Invest In 13 Cash-Rich Small Cap Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "It sometimes pays to check out stocks that experts really like. By experts, I'm referring to investors who have achieved tremendous success and analysts who spend most of their time researching stocks.\n\nBill Ackman is a good example of a wildly successful investor. He has amassed a fortune of close to $4 billion, thanks to shrewd moves with his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management.\n\nThe multibillionaire investor doesn't like many stocks. And several of them aren't favored by Wall Street. There's at least one notable exception, though. Ackman owns $1.8 billion of this stock -- and 38 Wall Street analysts recommend buying it right now.\n\nAckman's top stock\n\nAckman isn't a fan of building a highly diversified portfolio. Pershing Square Capital Management owns only eight stocks, but two of the stocks in Ackman's portfolio are for one company. He owns Alphabet Class A(NASDAQ: GOOGL) shares and Alphabet Class C(NASDAQ: GOOG) shares.\n\nWith both classes of shares combined, Google parent Alphabet ranks as Ackman's top holding. Pershing Square's stake in the technology giant is currently worth just a tad over the aforementioned $1.8 billion level.\n\nThis isn't a long-held position for Ackman. He initiated a position in Alphabet in early 2023. When the hedge fund CEO first bought the stock, it was down because of a mishandling of the launch of generative artificial intelligence (AI) app Bard. Many investors thought that Alphabet was being left behind by OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAckman, however, saw a great opportunity in the pullback. As he told CNBC in September 2023, he believes that Alphabet \"will be a dominant player in AI for the very, very long term.\"\n\nA lot of Alphabet bulls on Wall Street\n\nWall Street is largely in agreement with Ackman about Alphabet. Financial information company LSEG surveyed 43 analysts who cover the stock. Thirteen rated Alphabet as a strong buy, with another 25 recommending it as a buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat about the remaining five analysts? All of them recommended holding Alphabet stock, with none thinking it should be sold.\n\nGranted, many on Wall Street aren't expecting Alphabet shares to soar this year after its explosive 58% gain in 2023. The average 12-month price target reflects a modest upside potential of around 9%.\n\nArgus analyst Joseph Bonner's views on Alphabet are probably representative of quite a few others on Wall Street. Bonner wrote to investors recently, \"Alphabet remains at minimum competitive if not a leader in the development of generative AI, perhaps the new computing paradigm.\" He added that Argus is \"positive on Alphabet's underlying businesses and believe[s] that GOOGL shares are attractively valued.\"\n\nAre Ackman and analysts right about Alphabet?\n\nEven the so-called experts can be wrong. In this case, though, I think that both Ackman and Wall Street analysts are spot on about Alphabet.\n\nThe company is, without question, one of the leaders in AI development. I expect the launch of Gemini Ultra will provide a nice catalyst for Google Cloud.\n\nAlphabet revealed in December 2023 that Gemini Ultra beat the current state-of-the-art AI models (in many cases, OpenAI's GPT-4) in 30 of 32 benchmarks. The new AI model also is the first to outperform human experts on the MMLU (massive multitask language understanding) test, which includes 57 subjects.\n\nI don't think that Google Search faces an existential threat from AI, either. On the contrary, Alphabet could benefit from AI integration. A good example is Google's recent introduction of Circle to Search for Android phones, a way to search for anything with a quick gesture without switching apps.\n\nThe company and the stock could face a few bumps in the road along the way (including antitrust investigations). However, I fully expect that Alphabet will be a big winner over the long term -- just as it has been since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2004.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "The Nasdaq Just Did Something It Has Done Only 5 Times Before. History Says a Big Move in Stocks Could Follow in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) is an index comprising about 3,500 stocks, many of which come from the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. To that end, the Nasdaq is often considered a benchmark for growth stocks because many of its components are on the cutting edge of various technologies and consumer trends, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and e-commerce.\n\nInvestors rotated away from growth stocks as post-pandemic inflation scorched the economy. The Nasdaq tumbled deep into bear market territory in 2022, falling as much as 36% from its high.\n\nThat drawdown was largely driven by recession fears arising from aggressive monetary policy. Specifically, the Federal Reserve has battled inflation by raising its benchmark interest rate at its fastest pace since the 1980s. Many economists feared (and some continue to fear) that policymakers could trigger a recession by tightening credit conditions too quickly.\n\nHowever, the Nasdaq shook off those fears and moved higher last year as signs of economic resilience and excitement about artificial intelligence improved market sentiment. The index soared 43.4% in 2023, one of its best performances in history. Prior to that, the Nasdaq had achieved an annual gain exceeding 40% only five times since its inception in 1971.\n\nHistorically, annual gains exceeding 40% have portended more upward momentum in the Nasdaq. Of course, investors should never put too much weight on such forecasts simply because each situation is unique. The last few years have been defined by fallout from a global pandemic, and there is no precedent for such an event. Even so, historical patterns are still worth consideration. Here's what investors should know.\n\nHistory says the Nasdaq could move higher in 2024\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite returned 43.4% in 2023, marking the sixth time the index has increased more than 40% in a calendar year. The chart below shows the last five events and details the Nasdaq's return 12 months later.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear Nasdaq Return Nasdaq Return (12 Months Later) 1991 56.9% 15.5% 1999 85.6% (32.3%) 2003 50% 8.6% 2009 43.9% 16.9% 2020 43.6% 21.4% Median 15.5%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAs shown above, the Nasdaq has returned a median of 15.5% during the 12-month periods following an annual gain exceeding 40%. To add context, the Nasdaq has ticked down about half a percentage point this year, so the implied upside is about 16% through the remainder of 2024.\n\nInvestors should view that number as little more than a guess. The combination of a global pandemic, the fiercest inflation in four decades, and aggressive interest rate hikes make the current situation unique. As such, the Nasdaq may not perform as historical data suggests. But there is one more pattern investors may find interesting.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may be done raising interest rates\n\nThe Federal Reserve has hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be over. In fact, the latest projections from policymakers imply three 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2024. Futures investors are even more optimistic. The CME Group's Fed Watch tool -- which uses pricing data from futures contracts to estimate the probability of future rate hikes and cuts -- currently shows a 70% chance of at least six 25-basis-point cuts in 2024.\n\nIf credit conditions indeed loosen in the coming year, that shift in monetary policy would promote borrowing and spending among businesses and consumers. In turn, that should lead to robust economic expansion and strong growth in corporate revenues and profits. Investors get excited by those prospects, so the Nasdaq has historically risen sharply following the end of interest-rate-hike cycles.\n\nTo elaborate, the Federal Reserve has guided the economy through six rate-hike cycles since 1983. The Nasdaq returned a median of 20% during the 12-month period following the last rate hike in those cycles. For context, the Federal Reserve last increased its benchmark rate on July 27, since which time the Nasdaq has advanced 6%. That leaves implied upside of roughly 14% through July 2024.\n\nOf course, that presupposes that the Federal Reserve is indeed done raising interest rates. But that outcome is not guaranteed. Inflation actually reaccelerated to 3.4% in December, up from 3.1% in November, so policymakers could ultimately decide to tighten credit conditions further.\n\nPatience is key to making money in the stock market\n\nInvestors should avoid strategies based on market timing. Not even the smartest economists and Wall Street strategists know what the year ahead will bring. Some pundits are forecasting the worst crash in decades, while others see only a modest risk of recession. But those concerns become less pressing with a long-term mindset.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell 56% during the bear market that accompanied the Great Recession, and it took more than three years for the index to regain its record high. But the Nasdaq has still gained 424% since the drawdown started. In other words, investors who bought a Nasdaq Composite index fund the day the bear market began have still seen annualized returns of 10.8% during the last 16 years.\n\nThe lesson here is simple: Patience is the key to making money in the stock market. Investors who buy individual stocks should carefully research each company before buying shares, paying close attention to growth prospects and valuation.\n\nCompanies primed to benefit from artificial intelligence are a good place to start. That includes software vendors like Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG), cloud services providers like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and chipmakers like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Those companies are members of the Nasdaq Composite, and all but Datadog rank among its 10 largest components.\n\nAlternatively, investors can save themselves some work with an index fund strategy, either in lieu of or in addition to individual stocks. A Nasdaq Composite index fund like the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite ETF(NASDAQ: ONEQ) would tap directly into the Nasdaq's returns. Investors should also consider an S&P 500 index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO). Warren Buffett has often recommended that strategy. But no matter the strategy, patience is the key to making money.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Walmart\n\nWhen our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Could Help Make You Rich in 2024",
        "content": "As the company supplying 80% of the necessary training chips, Nvidia was arguably the biggest winner in 2023's artificial intelligence (AI) boom. That said, it makes sense for investors to diversify their holdings to target different sides of the long-term opportunity. Let's look at why Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) could also have a place in your portfolio in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nWith a market cap of $1.79 trillion, Alphabet is already the fourth-largest company in the world, and it will take a lot of momentum to power continued expansion. But AI may be able to do the trick. The tech giant is heavily incorporating AI infrastructure into its cloud-computing platform, which could generate much-needed diversification and long-term growth.\n\nAmong AI companies, Nvidia is particularly successful because it targets the \"picks and shovels\" side of the opportunity, minimizing competition while maximizing the total addressable market for its products. Google is developing a similar strategy (albeit higher on the value chain) by turning Google Cloud into a one-stop shop for all its enterprise clients' data-management and AI training needs. And while Google isn't the only cloud-service provider employing this strategy, it has some key advantages.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to CEO Sundar Pichai, 70% of generative AI start-up unicorns use Google's infrastructure to train and run their models. This is a big vote of confidence in the platform's quality and price point. And Google plans to build on this advantage with proprietary AI chips (called tensor processing units), which can bring down costs through vertical integration and reduce the company's reliance on third-party suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nAlphabet's low valuation is icing on the cake for investors. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 22, the stock is significantly cheaper than the NASDAQ 100's estimate of 29.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nFollowing the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, Meta's share price has been on a tear, jumping a substantial 174% in the last 12 months alone. Investors are optimistic about the company's decision to pivot away from metaverse development to focus more on generative AI, which could optimize its advertising and improve its consumer-facing platforms.\n\nAt first glance, Meta has some clear advantages in its AI efforts. The social media giant's business model has always involved gathering and monetizing huge amounts of data. And generative AI opens another avenue for this strategy through large language models (LLMs), which are algorithms designed to create content out of trained datasets.\n\nMeta is also adding conversational AI experiences across its popular apps, introducing features ranging from more responsive image editing on Instagram to conversational chatbots with distinct personalities on WhatsApp. These efforts probably won't immediately impact Meta's operational performance, but they could help maintain its platforms' user engagement and generate valuable customer data.\n\nOn the operational side, Meta is bouncing back from the challenges it faced in 2022. Third-quarter (2023) revenue jumped by 23% year over year to $34.15 billion, while net income jumped 164% to $11.58 billion, helped by aggressive cost cutting and layoffs. And with a forward P/E of just 22, it isn't too late for investors to bet on the company's long-term potential.\n\nAn increasingly competitive landscape\n\nIn 2024 and beyond, investors should expect the AI landscape to become increasingly competitive, especially on the software side of the market. With that in mind, it makes sense to bet on companies with potential economic moats. Alphabet and Meta Platforms fit the bill because of their treasure troves of user data, which can be used to train and refine LLMs. Both companies look poised for market-beating growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "4 worrying trends in tech that are fueling Google and Amazon layoffs",
        "content": "Technology jobs were once synonymous with job security. But after last year, one of the biggest for layoffs in over a decade, combined with the rise of potentially job-killing artificial intelligence, a bleak horizon hovers over the humans in the technology industry who are now at risk of losing their livelihoods.\n\nWith the exception of the pandemic-driven job cuts in 2020, last year saw the highest yearly total of tech job cuts since the Great Recession, with companies cutting more than 720,000 jobs from their budgets, according to a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc., a job market research company. And that’s continued into the first month of 2024, with Google, Amazon and smaller tech firms announcing further cuts in recent weeks.\n\nBut why are companies slashing jobs now? A drive for profitability, the remains of the pandemic hiring hangover, rapidly developing AI and—somewhat ironically—slowing inflation all play a part, according to industry watchers, while the timing can be blamed on the corporate budget calendar. But there's a silver lining, with the still-tight labor market meaning laid-off techies should be able to find work elsewhere.\n\nCost-cutting as Google and Amazon search for profit\n\nGoogle was clear in its job-cut announcement this week that it was cutting several hundred workers to further reduce costs. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in a memo that the company wanted to invest more in emerging areas, including AI, while cutting costs elsewhere. “We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,” he wrote in a memo confirmed by Fortune. A company spokesperson characterized the cuts as “responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities” and said “a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better.” Some Google employees pushed back against this rationale, with members of the Alphabet Workers Union blasting the company’s “senseless, misguided corporate decision making” in a press release.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther multi-billion-dollar tech companies, like Amazon, also announced hundreds of employee cuts from its media divisions, including Prime Video, Amazon MGM Studios, video streaming platform Twitch, and Audible, its audiobook and podcast division. After tens of thousands of cuts last year, which hit areas seen as less essential to the company’s bottom line including voice-assistant Alexa, this month's cuts likewise attempts to slash costs in the high-cost, lower-profit area of content, where Amazon is the number-three spender after rivals Netflix and Disney.\n\nPandemic hiring boom still deflating\n\nAnother reason tech giants can keep reducing their ranks of employees is because their employee pools are still quite deep, after the “wild hiring spree” that many big companies embarked on during 2021 and 2022, as Challenger said. Last year’s cuts were a result of that spree, when many tech companies trimmed down their workforces after realizing they over-hired in prior years. With the latest cuts, some of those companies are realizing they didn’t cut enough in the first rounds.\n\nFrom hiring to layoffs, “tech is one of the areas that has seen the quickest turnaround,” Challenger said.\n\nAfter the pandemic boom, companies are also buckling in for slower growth ahead, with interest rates staying higher for longer—which also plays into the renewed focus on profitability. “As with many other companies in the tech space, we are now sizing our organization based upon the current scale of our business,” Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote last week, adding that his company is erring on the side of caution with “conservative predictions of how we expect to grow in the future.”\n\nRelatedly, the rise of AI in other parts of the tech world has also made the climate frostier for technology hires. Since the massive popularization of AI chatbot ChatGPT, companies have been focused on hiring AI-adjacent roles in an arms race with competitors to get ahead of what’s believed to be the next tech boom. At the same time, they’re downsizing non-AI areas to manage their expenses and keep their businesses profitable. And AI’s feared job-killing aspects could have ramifications here, too, although it’s only playing a small role at the moment, Challenger said. Companies said AI was responsible for 4,000 cuts last year, per the report, but it “is something we’re concerned about for the future,” Challenger said.\n\nFalling inflation is a bad sign\n\nIronically, the falling inflation that has been a boon for consumers is also a factor in the tech layoffs, according to Challenger. As of last month, annual inflation is around 3%, substantially lower than its 6% rate at the start of the year. But because prices are no longer rising as quickly, this makes it harder for companies to raise the cost of their services, as customers, whose paychecks are also stymied by inflation, may not be willing to pay more for them, Challenger said.\n\n“It’s harder for companies to increase their prices as they have been,” while also paying for increased labor costs, he said. “So this inflationary cycle is one of the main culprits for these layoffs.”\n\nIt’s never great to find out you’re losing your job, he said, but explained that this period is better than most because “unemployment is still below 4%, and a lot of people that lose their jobs now have a high likelihood of finding more work pretty quickly.”\n\nThe right timing: layoffs are not just for year-end\n\nThere's another reason for the timing of cuts in January, and that’s simply the corporate budget calendar. Job cuts tend to spike in December and January as companies prepare for structural changes heading into the new year, economist Rachel Sederberg told USA Today.\n\n“A lot of firms are reaching their fiscal year-end,”  Sederberg, senior economist at labor markets analytics firm Lightcast, told the outlet. “They're taking a hard look at what's going on their balance sheets as well as how the business is performing, and they make decisions along those lines. And sometimes that has implications for workers.”\n\nChallenger told Fortune that “fiscal year-ends have shifted over time,” which allows some companies to refrain from cutting workers right before or after the holidays. That’s a bittersweet development for workers, since it can mean the pain of layoffs extends deeper into a new year than before.\n\nIn December, job cuts were down by 24% from the previous month and marked the second-lowest monthly cuts in 2023. Compared to December 2022, this year’s cuts are down by 20%. Challenger confirmed that more cuts should be expected at least into the first quarter of the new year.\n\nPriorities in profitability\n\nRelated sectors, like media, have also seen more cuts as companies shift focus on profitability in a tough economic climate.\n\nJob cuts in media industries have boomed even more than the rest. Last year, the industry scraped over 21,400 jobs, up more than 460% from about 3,750 jobs cut during the same period in 2022. With an exception of 2020, it’s the most jobs the industry has slashed since 2009, which saw over 22,000 jobs cut.\n\nIn a round of layoffs in November, online publisher Vox Media cut 4% of its staff. Earlier in March, the company slashed 7% of its workforce. Conde Nast, which publishes magazines like Vogue, GQ and Vanity Fair, fired 5% of its employees in November. This week, Sports Illustrated said it would cut its entire newsroom, while staff at the Los Angeles Times walked out in protest of \"substantial\" job cuts that the paper's owner had promised.\n\nLooking ahead, Challenger said that the cuts are expected to continue into the new year. “We’ve seen job cuts increase over every sector in the past year,” he said. “These three have just seen the most this year.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Monopoly Definition and 11 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 11 near-monopoly stocks in the US. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nA pure monopoly, by definition, refers to a company with no competition whatsoever – a sole provider of a particular product or service. An illustration of this was Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which, at one point, stood as the exclusive seller of software and operating systems for computers, leaving consumers with only one option for these products. The connection between monopolies and U.S. consumers is rife with contradictions. Americans harbor suspicions about companies that wield a dominant influence over their industries, closely monitoring how these entities leverage their size and market dominance to maximize profits. Paradoxically, while Americans express concerns about monopolistic power, they readily embrace the advantages associated with economies of scale. Large market leaders are often preferred over small family businesses attempting to compete, fostering an environment that encourages rather than discourages the expansion of market share by substantial corporations.\n\nMonopolies wield significant pricing power, a crucial factor that investor Warren Buffett carefully considers when selecting stocks for his globally tracked portfolio. During his 2011 testimony before the US Congress, Buffett cited pricing power as a vital criterion for evaluating a business. He emphasized that a business with the ability to increase prices without losing market share to competitors exhibits a robust business model.\n\nWhile pure monopolies are rare, some contemporary companies exhibit what can be termed near-monopolies. Benefiting from economies of scale, these corporations establish formidable barriers that discourage new entrants from challenging their dominance. Market leaders like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have penetrated a sector and captured a substantial portion of the market are deemed as some of the best monopoly stocks in that regard. In a bid to expand their market share and revenue, these companies often diversify their product offerings. While they may allows some space for competition, companies like the ones mentioned above boast considerable market power, exerting significant influence over the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn theory, a near-monopoly may not pose a problem, but in practice, such a system may not work in the best interests of consumers unless it is closely monitored. In the absence of competition, monopolies may set excessive prices, offer poor-quality products, and eliminate alternatives to maximize their own profits. While the law doesn't outright prohibit monopolies, various regulations have been implemented to ensure that such companies operate fairly. The Sherman Antitrust Act is a significant piece of legislation used to break up companies that hinder competition and prevent mergers and acquisitions that could lead to a virtual monopoly. While these regulations may limit the profits of monopolies, investors often find these stocks appealing. The substantial market share held by monopolies is likely to contribute to growth and value over time, mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security. Monopoly Definition and 11 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe've identified 11 stocks in the US that exhibit near-monopoly characteristics based on their substantial market share. Several of these companies are part of the FAANG group. The major technology corporations within this list maintain a dominant market presence across various sectors, such as cloud computing, e-commerce, mobile application services, mobile operating systems, search engines, social networking, and web browsers. Additionally, the remaining stocks in the selection assert near-monopoly positions in diverse sectors, including alcoholic beverages, personal credit rating, and satellite radio. The rankings are determined by the number of hedge funds holding stakes in these stocks as of Q3 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 9\n\nPearson plc (NYSE:PSO) is a British multinational publishing and education company with its headquarters in London. Initially established as a construction business in the 1840s, it transitioned to publishing in the 1920s. The company holds the distinction of being the largest publisher of educational materials and textbooks globally.\n\nPearson plc(NYSE:PSO)  generates approximately two-thirds of its revenue and profit from the US market. With a market share exceeding 40%, the company is a dominant force in the fields of assessment, publishing, and online program management in the US. In contrast, the remaining segment of the education publishing and assessment service market is highly fragmented, with numerous smaller players.\n\nAt the end of Q3 2023, 9 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO), a slight increase from the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $15.87 million. Among these hedge funds, 13D Management was the company’s leading stakeholder in Q3 2023.\n\nMuch like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Pearson plc (NYSE:PSO) operates as one of the best monopoly stocks in the US.\n\n10. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), is an American brewing company with its headquarters situated in St. Louis, Missouri. Currently recognized as the world's largest brewing company. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV possesses an array of global brands, including renowned names such as Budweiser, Michelob, Stella Artois, and Beck's.\n\nWhile the company has suffered controversies in the past few months, it continues to hold the distinction of being the largest beer producer globally by volume. In 2022, the company achieved a staggering global production volume of 595 million hectoliters, representing over 25% of the total global beer production. Furthermore, Anheuser-Busch InBev Sa/NV (NYSE:BUD) reported robust financial figures with a revenue of $57.7 billion and a net income approaching $6 billion in 2022.\n\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was one of the largest shareholders in Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) at the end of the third quarter of 2023, holding 1.7 million shares valued at $94.17 million. Overall, 21 hedge funds reported holding stakes in the company as of the end of the quarter.\n\nIn its Q2 2023 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management, a boutique investment firm, commented about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD). Here is what the firm said:\n\n“The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.”\n\n9. Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 24\n\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI) is a U.S.-based broadcasting corporation with its headquarters located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.

(NASDAQ:SIRI)’s in Q3 2023. Out of these, the biggest investor was Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management due to its $66.1 million investment.\n\n8. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 40\n\nAltria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) stands out as a notable American corporation, recognized as one of the largest manufacturers and promoters of tobacco, cigarettes, and associated products on a global scale. The company operates globally from its headquarters in Henrico County, Virginia. Boasting an impressive 54-year record of consistently increasing dividends, Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) has demonstrated considerable expertise in effectively navigating market downturns.\n\nAltria Group, Inc.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s largest shareholder in the third quarter remained Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway which owned 915.56 million shares that are worth $156 billion.\n\nA member of the Big Five, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), much like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), is one of the best monopoly stocks in the US.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds highlighted a few stocks and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“After a strong start to the year, shares of Apple Inc. partially retraced their gains this quarter. Mixed second calendar quarter financial results, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue coming in just shy of consensus expectations, coupled with elevated investor concerns about the macro economy and potential weakness in consumer spending later this year, pressured shares. Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. On top of these trends in the core business, Apple is thoughtfully investing in new categories like augmented reality, search, financial services, and streaming media content. We took advantage of weakness in the quarter to add to our position in Apple.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nKen Griffin Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates’ Top 15 Dividend Stocks 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure. None.

It did not provide details on when its service will go live.\n\nWaymo said this month it would begin testing its fully autonomous passenger cars without a human driver on freeways in Phoenix, Arizona, where it now offers rides in the metropolitan area. The company also aims to operate in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe company last year pushed back its efforts to develop a commercial autonomous trucking technology soon after autonomous driving software came under strong regulatory scrutiny.\n\nGeneral Motors' Cruise driverless car unit paused all supervised and manual car trips in the U.S. last year after an accident led to the suspension of driverless vehicle operations.\n\n(Reporting by Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru; Editing by William Mallard)",

        "content": "Advancements in artificial intelligence have been one of the biggest stories of 2023 and remain a trending topic for 2024. As part of part of Yahoo Finance's exclusive coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi spoke to preeminent leaders and top executives across the industry about advancements in AI and expectations for the coming year.\n\nThe advancements in artificial intelligence, generative AI in particular, have had a major impact on the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. \"I found it's a real productivity increase,\" former Microsoft (MSFT) President and CEO Bill Gates explained. \"Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40, 50% productivity improvement, which means you can get programs sooner. You can make them higher quality, make them better.\"\n\nNasdaq (NDAQ) CEO and President Adena Friedman broke down the impact of AI on new companies entering the market. Friedman said, \"Very exciting time, I have to say, because every company can benefit from this next generation of technology. I think you can look at every industry and gen AI has applicability. So companies that help unlock that potential are going to be, I think, companies that a lot of investors are looking at.\"\n\nBank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan provided his thoughts on AI applications. Moynihan said, \"We completely believe that this will have a big impact ... you have to have the ability to convert processes to technique through language models and learning models. The trick in that is that we have to have accountability.\"\n\nThe popularity of generative AI will impact companies like Verizon Communications (VZ), which controls the wireless networks which will transmit so much of this data. Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said, \"I think at the edge of the network it's going to be very important to have AI to take quick decisions very close to the end views of the customer or the enterprise. And of course that's how we build our network.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNovartis (NVS) recently announced a partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and also has an existing partnership with Microsoft, which leverages its AI platform. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan explained, \"We developed an approach called generative chemistry to try to speed up how fast we can bring new medicines into the clinic ... it's really opening up new horizons.\"\n\nCisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins discussed the trajectory of AI and the impact it will have across the industry. Robbins said, \"I think the ones that are going to win are the ones that figure out how do I create value based capabilities that help end users take advantage of the data they have.\"\n\nSalesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff believes that we will one day have AI employees, but we are not there yet. Benioff said, \"There's no question that where AI is going is digital employees ... in today's world that's not where AI is. We know that AI has got a lot of problems still.\"\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon broke down the state of the semiconductor sector given the surge in AI demand. Amon explained, \"It's so exciting we did something that is very unique. We can run those large language models on your phone, and you can do them very fast.\"\n\nMicrosoft has plans to expand its AI capabilities. Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said, \"I think this is one technology that will live up to the impact that people expect ... it is quite possibly the defining technology of our lifetime, certainly this decade I think without question.\"\n\nC3.ai (AI) Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel discussed his expectations for AI products as more companies pivot into the space. Siebel said, \"Generative AI changes everything. It fundamentally changes the nature of the human-computer interface as it relates to enterprise application software, and this is big.\"\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) is utilizing AI in its email marketing as well as its supply chain optimization. Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber explained, \"We're seeing great benefit on the supply chain side being optimized. And we can optimize it for time, or we can optimize it for cost.\"\n\nGrammy Award-winning musician and entrepreneur will.i.am announced a new radio show he will be co-hosting with an AI co-host. Will.i.am explained, \"It's trained on the world's information ... and I think that's the way to really educate people on where we are.\"\n\nVideo highlights:\n\n00:00:03 - Bill Gates\n\n00:00:22 - Nasdaq CEO and President Adena Friedman\n\n00:00:38 - Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan\n\n00:00:58 - Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg\n\n00:01:11 - Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan\n\n00:01:32 - Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins\n\n00:01:48 - Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff\n\n00:02:02 - Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon\n\n00:02:26 - Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith\n\n00:02:47 - C3.ai Founder, Chairman, and CEO Tom Siebel\n\n00:03:02 - Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber\n\n00:03:19 - will.i.am",

        "title": "Why AI data innovation will come faster from small companies",
        "content": "According to many experts, artificial intelligence will be a boom for productivity and efficiency—but only if quality data is provided. Tech giants including Meta (META) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are taking the lead and could very easily swallow the smaller stakeholders in the sector, specifically in the monetization of data.\n\nNomad Data CEO Brad Schneider discusses how AI will turn data into dollars. Schneider notes that social and online media sites will instrument the first wave of data monetization, which involves training large language models, while the second wave focuses on more specific, “narrower” models that serve single functions.\n\nLarge tech companies are \"the most data-hungry ones today,” Schneider explains, saying they are \"building the tools\" of the so-called AI revolution. Schneider goes on to say smaller companies will be able to innovate AI faster.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Well, of course, AI is only as good as the quality of the data that it's trained on, which means tech giants, like Meta and Google, with a sizable edge can crush smaller players. Now our next guest says billions of dollars of data was bought and sold over the last 12 months, and expects it to double this year. But how does AI turn our data into dollars in the marketplace?\n\nWell, to tell us more, Brad Schneider, nomad data CEO is here. Thank you for joining us this morning. So as Akiko was mentioning, when people think of AI and data, it seems this amorphous blob here. So what do we need to know about the sort of data that these large language models are trained on, and how it actually turns into dollars for some of these companies that want to use it?\n\nBRAD SCHNEIDER: Sure. I mean, one of the biggest first movers is just the media sites themselves. A lot of these AI engines are trained on enormous corpuses of text. And so firms like Yahoo, for example, and many of the other Premier media outlets are starting to license this data to train the largest models, and that's really going to drive the first wave of this. But the second wave is going to be these more specific models, these narrower models that people are putting into the hands of consumers where they're there to perform one individual specific function, and that is going to expand the breadth of data necessary for training pretty dramatically.\n\nStory continues\n\n- And so obviously, there's a fire hose of data that's out there, even more than ever thanks to large language models. So which companies or sectors are really leading the charge and really making the most of this, especially some of these larger companies that obviously have a lot more access to data?\n\nBRAD SCHNEIDER: I mean, it's an interesting question. Obviously, the large companies, the Microsofts, the OpenAIs, the Anthropics, they're driving the beginning of this revolution. So they're the most data-hungry ones today. But really, the scale of those companies requires them to sell things to enormous numbers of people. So they're building the tools. If you think about the gold rush, for example, those selling the picks and shovels, were the largest of companies and the ones that sort of stood the test of time, and that's what we're seeing with these large tech companies.\n\nBut really, at least from my point of view, the innovation is going to happen with the people that are using those tools. So a lot of these companies that you have not heard of, it's going to really allow small companies to innovate and move a lot more quickly than a big company can for a variety of different reasons. Most of these companies selling the infrastructure.\n\nMicrosoft, for example, they can't be building a product that does $1 million a year in revenue. Their revenue scale is so enormous that they need to sell something to everybody. And so I think the real innovation is going to come from companies that you've heard less about, or maybe you haven't considered that AI could play a big role in.",

        "title": "Nvidia stock hits all-time high as AI craze rolls on",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stocks hit an all-time high on Friday, as the AI craze continues to roll on in early 2024. Nvidia’s share price jumped more than 2% to $584.87 as of midday. Shares of the AI juggernaut are up some 18% in the first few weeks of the new year and 179% over the last 12 months. And its market cap is quickly approaching $1.5 trillion.\n\nBut Nvidia isn’t the only company benefiting from the AI hype. Rival AMD (AMD) hit an all-time intraday high on Thursday, topping out at $168.60 per share. The chipmaker is up 94% through the last 12 months. Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped 57% over the same period.\n\nNvidia got a huge vote of confidence on Thursday when Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is spending billions of dollars to acquire thousands of Nvidia chips for its AI projects. In an Instagram Reels post, Zuckerberg said Meta will build out AI infrastructure complete with 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 with the goal of developing general artificial intelligence. Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang holds one of the company's new RTX 4090 chips for computer gaming. Sept. 20, 2022. Courtesy of Nvidia Corp/Handout via REUTERS (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nZuckerberg also said he wants to make Meta’s general AI open source, allowing others to use and work with it.\n\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip development, with an estimated market share of between 70% and 90% of the global market. But it’s not just Nvidia’s hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The company’s Cuda software, which developers use to create AI platforms, also serves as a moat that keeps Nvidia above the fray.\n\nThat said, Nvidia’s rivals are gathering with the intent of snatching market share. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its own Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nIt’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Meta, are increasingly turning to chips they develop on their own to power their AI accelerators in the form of what are known as ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits.\n\nStory continues Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThink of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it.\n\nASICs on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. They’re built specifically for a company’s own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\n\nThat’s a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as ASICs start to take hold, they may have less of a need for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nStill, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. In other words, there’s still plenty of room to grow. Even if Nvidia’s market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.\n\nFor now, though, Nvidia remains the AI king.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to expand its presence in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from Google’s latest investment plans for its U.K. data center, in which it intends to infuse $1 billion. The move follows Alphabet's purchase of a central London office building for $1 billion in 2022 and another site in nearby King's Cross.\r\n\r\nThe underlined data center will be based on a 33-acre site located in the town of Waltham Cross.\r\n\r\nGoogle strives to meet the growing demand for its AI and cloud services in the U.K. on the back of its latest move.\r\n\r\nThe move positions the company well to capitalize on the growth prospects present in the U.K. cloud space. Per a report from Statista, the United Kingdom's public cloud market is expected to generate revenues worth $26.73 billion in 2024. The figure is expected to reach $37.84 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 9.1% between 2024 and 2028.\n\nExpanding Cloud Regions Network\n\nGoogle’s latest investment plans are in sync with its growing efforts to strengthen its footprint in Europe.\r\n\r\nApart from the U.K. data center, the opening of its second cloud region in Italy last year, which is located in Turin, remains a major positive.\r\n\r\nAt present, Google operates 11 cloud regions in Europe, each with three zones.\r\n\r\nApart from Europe, Google’s growing interest in the APAC region remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company is gaining well from its cloud regions located in Tel Aviv, Israel; New Delhi, India and Melbourne, Australia.\r\n\r\nLooking across the world, the total number of Google Cloud regions is currently 39, with 118 zones and 187 network edge locations.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud’s newly added regions include Berlin, Germany; Doha, Qatar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud intends to further expand its cloud region network in Doha (Qatar), Berlin (Germany), Dammam (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and Queretaro (Mexico).\r\n\r\nAlso, it is preparing to open cloud regions in Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand, Greece, Norway, South Africa, Austria and Sweden.\r\n\r\nWe believe all these endeavors are expected to contribute well to the performance of Google Cloud in the near term as well as in the long haul.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Prospects, Competitive Scenario\n\nWith the increasing number of regions across the globe, Google remains well-poised to capitalize on the prospects of the global cloud market.\r\n\r\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global cloud computing market is assumed to witness a CAGR of 14.1% from 2023 to 2030.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s growing prospects in the booming cloud computing market are expected to aid Alphabet in winning investors’ confidence in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThis apart, Google’s concerted efforts are expected to aid its competitive position against other major cloud players, such as Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT, which are also leaving no stone unturned to boost their presence in this promising market further.\r\n\r\nAmazon is constantly benefiting from the solid momentum in its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), which holds a dominant position in the cloud computing space on the back of its increasing number of data centers, availability zones and regions.\r\n\r\nThe company’s recent launch of its second infrastructure region in Canada, which is in Calgary, remains noteworthy. AWS’ increasing regions in Europe remain a plus. The company operates seven AWS Regions and 21 availability zones across Europe in Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm and Zurich.\r\n\r\nCurrently, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions. It further plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS regions in Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure became Microsoft's key driver. MSFT is currently riding on the robust adoption of Azure’s cloud offerings. Azure's increasing number of availability zones and regions across the globe and its strength in the consumption-based business are likely to continue driving MSFT's cloud momentum in the near term.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Azure is operating in more than 60 cloud regions at present.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Arista Networks ANET, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A pair of scientists at Google DeepMind, the Alphabet Inc. artificial intelligence division, have been talking with investors about forming an AI startup in Paris, according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union S&P 500 Hits All-Time High in Historic Bull Run: Markets Wrap Ford Cuts Workforce Making Electric F-150s on Weak Demand YouTube and Spotify Won’t Launch Apple Vision Pro Apps, Joining Netflix China’s $6.3 Trillion Stock Selloff Is Getting Uglier by the Day\n\nThe team has held discussions with potential investors about a financing round that may exceed €200 million ($220 million) — a large sum, even for the buzzy field of AI, the people said. Laurent Sifre, who has been working as a scientist at DeepMind, is in talks to form the company, known at the moment as Holistic, with fellow DeepMind scientist Karl Tuyls, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private information. They said the venture may be focused on building a new AI model.\n\nSifre and Tuyls didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. A DeepMind representative declined to comment on the startup plans. The two have given notice to leave the company, a person familiar with the situation said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.\n\nSifre was a co-author of the 2016 DeepMind research on Go, a seminal work that showed a computer system beating masters of the ancient game for the first time, which sparked an international frenzy over AI. Tuyls has worked on research into game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning, a branch of AI that explores interactions between autonomous actors, often through video games.\n\nBoth Sifre and Tuyls are widely considered leaders in their field, and the unusually large financing round being discussed is further evidence of strong investor interest in the technology. That’s particularly true in France, where venture capitalists and business tycoons have poured funds into startups emerging from Parisian universities and the AI hubs of Silicon Valley firms.\n\nStory continues\n\nMistral AI, an OpenAI rival whose chief executive officer also worked for DeepMind, formed in early 2023 and had raised two sizable rounds by the year’s end to earn a valuation around $2 billion. Kyutai, a nonprofit AI research lab, was formed in November with €300 million in initial funding.\n\nThe new French startup under discussion is different from Holistic AI, an enterprise software business based in London.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

The firms are highly focused on the development of digital transformation solutions through the cloud to cater to increasing customer demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nGiven the booming scenario in APAC, not only Amazon but also its peers like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Alibaba BABA are leaving no stone unturned to expand their presence in the region.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Azure is gearing up for the opening of five data centers in APAC, namely South Central India, Indonesia Central, Malaysia West, New Zealand North and Taiwan North, which will be located in Hyderabad, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Auckland and Taipei, respectively.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure also has plans to launch a Saudi Arabia Central region.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alphabet’s Google launched a data center in Japan in 2023, marking its third such establishment in Asia.

        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks — Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META — had a stellar 2023. The solid trend has continued with the start of 2024 on the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) craze, with the exception of Apple and Tesla.\r\n\r\nApple has been struggling, with shares plunging 2% on concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Meanwhile, Tesla dropped nearly 12%, driven by price cuts of its electric vehicles in China and Europe as well as supply chain delays due to a crisis in the Red Sea (read: Microsoft & Apple in Tug-Of-War: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nHowever, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. Overall, fourth-quarter earnings for \"Magnificent Seven\" are expected to grow 38.4% from the same period last year on 12.4% higher revenues. This would follow the 54.2% earnings growth for the group in the third quarter on 12.9% higher revenues.\r\n\r\nAmong the group of companies, Tesla is set to report first on Jan 24, followed by Microsoft on Jan 30.

        "title": "Google and Amazon layoff reports are ‘garbage information’—two of Wall Street’s top minds say companies are clinging to workers instead",
        "content": "In a throwback to 2023, the tech industry kicked off the new year with another round of headline-grabbing layoffs. Many once high-flying tech firms have been left with bloated workforces that need trimming after near-zero interest rates and increased government spending helped spark a pandemic hiring boom.\n\nThat sounds scary—and, if you’re among the unlucky souls being laid off, it is. But most consumers and investors read far too much into splashy layoff headlines that won’t affect them, according to Bob Elliott, co-founder and CIO of the investment firm Unlimited. The reality is, at least for now, January’s layoffs are too small to put a dent into the otherwise thriving labor market.\n\n“Anecdotal reports of tech layoffs are garbage information—garbage, garbage information,” Elliott told Fortune. “It's important to contextualize them. People are talking about layoffs of 170 people; it’s irrelevant. Unless someone is talking about 100,000 layoffs, it's just not a meaningful influence.\"\n\nThe tech sector aside, Elliott and many of his peers believe the labor market as a whole remains robust. These economists and Wall Street money managers point to a raft of hard data to back up their point, from subdued initial jobless claims data to the still historically low 3.7% unemployment rate.\n\nWells Fargo’s chief economist, Jay Bryson, told Fortune that after years of struggling to find talent, most businesses are also doing everything they can to avoid layoffs. It’s a tactic that some economists call labor hoarding—and it could help the economy avoid a recession, Bryson said.\n\n“If you talk to businesses, they'll still complain about how difficult it is to get labor. And it's been difficult for a few years,” he explained. “So even if orders are slowing a little bit…businesses are probably going to try to hold on to their people as long as they can, because they don't want to have to let them go just to have to get them back later.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTech layoffs: anecdotes versus numbers\n\nBefore getting into the numbers that may provide some optimism, it’s important to note that many tech companies are tightening their belts, and have signaled that more layoffs are coming.\n\nJanuary has seen a flurry of familiar layoff announcements from tech leaders. Google’s parent company Alphabet followed up last year’s downsizing spree this month by cutting more than a thousand positions across multiple divisions, from advertising to YouTube. Amazon announced it will lay off hundreds of employees from its Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios divisions, while its subsidiary Twitch said it would let go of 500 staff. And smaller tech companies haven’t avoided the carnage. The video game software company Unity Software revealed plans to slash 1,800 jobs, and the workplace solutions firm Xeroxannounced it would lay off roughly 3,000 employees in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nBut while these recent headlines often portray a dire situation for tech companies, Unlimited’s Elliott argues that the anecdotes need to be put in perspective.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nHe noted that between January and November of last year, on average, there were 1.6 million layoffs each month, recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. Compare that to the roughly 7,800 tech industry layoffs seen through the first 18 days of 2024, according to data from the tech layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi, and tech companies’ problems begin to seem less daunting for the economy as a whole.\n\nAdd in even more context, and the tech layoffs don’t seem so bad at all—at least compared to last year. In 2023, 263,000 tech employees were let go. That’s an average of roughly 22,000 per month. Given that we’re already more than halfway through January, 2024’s monthly tech layoffs are actually on pace to decline compared to last year’s average.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nAll of this means tech layoff headlines can be misleading, portraying a more dire economic situation than the underlying data suggests—or, as Elliott put it, “My answer to the [tech layoff] anecdotes is that they suck.”\n\nOn top of that, at least one big tech executive has been fairly clear that layoffs at his company won’t be getting any worse after a rough 2023. After announcing plans to cut roughly 12,000 jobs last January, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, sought to calm employee fears over his latest round of layoffs in an internal memo on Wednesday, the Verge first reported. While Pichai noted that more “role eliminations” are to come, he also said they won’t be “at the scale of last year’s reductions, and will not touch every team.”\n\nThe latest hard evidence of labor market resilience\n\nOverall, despite the recent tech layoff headlines, experts believe the labor market remains on strong footing—and there’s hard data to back that up. Initial jobless claims, which represent the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits each week, are perhaps the best evidence of the labor market’s strength, according to Unlimited’s Elliott.\n\n“When people get laid off, they go file for unemployment,” he explained, adding that “there’s not a lot of indication of further weakness when you look at the initial claims data, which really is the best real-time indication of layoffs in the economy.”\n\nThere were just 187,000 initial filings for unemployment insurance for the week that ended Jan. 13, the U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday—the lowest level since September 2022.\n\nAnd after rising for much of last year, continuing claims, a rough indicator of the number of longer-term unemployed, also dropped by 26,000 to 1.8 million last week. “Continuing claims have been declining, potentially pointing to the hiring rate picking up somewhat,” Citi analyst Gisela Hoxha said in a Thursday note to clients.\n\nCould labor hoarding help prevent a recession?\n\nFor now, the labor market is still performing, despite the scary stories about tech layoffs. And Jefferies’ senior economist Thomas Simons expects that to continue for a while, too—due, at least in part, to labor hoarding.\n\n“Businesses have been extremely reticent to let go of workers that they struggled to find over the last 3 years,” he explained in a Thursday note. “We doubt that they will be able to hold on to everyone indefinitely, but they're going to try.”\n\nSimons noted that there have even been signs that some tech companies are “opting to reassign workers from eliminated teams into other roles rather than let them go.”\n\nThat’s good news for more than the affected workers—Wells Fargo’s Bryson argued that employers' desire to hang onto talent could even help prevent a recession this year. Bryson recently revised his economic outlook for 2024. He previously forecast a mild recession, but now sees a soft landing—where inflation fades without a job-killing recession—due to the labor market’s strength over the past few months.\n\n“It’s definitely one of the reasons why we ditched the recession call,” he told Fortune. “The labor market is not falling apart, and that's how you get to recessions. Spending slows enough that it causes layoffs, and then that leads to more slowing spending, which leads to more layoffs. And you get into this vicious circle. We're just not having that second part.”\n\nBryson argued that rising profit margins over the past few years are likely helping fend off a recession, and might enable employers to hang onto workers for longer as well.\n\n“If you look at margins, profit growth with companies in general remains pretty good right now,” he said. “Nobody that I know is in a hurry to lay lots of people off at this point. It took them a long, long time to get that labor.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Juxtaposed with Microsoft’s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google’s stock on the report.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg just escalated the war for AI talent against Google and OpenAI with a clever Reels video and an AI team reorg",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg is turning up the heat in the already competitive AI market by merging his company's two advanced AI divisions into one group, a move to accelerate Meta's development of general purpose artificial intelligence chatbots and to win the competition for AI engineering talent.\n\nAppearing on an Instagram Reel video Thursday, the Meta CEO announced the change to the company's AI teams and talked up its various efforts in the field, including big investments specialized computer chips to help it build and deliver new generative AI models and products. Zuckerberg also said the company had begun training its next generation Llama 3 large language model.\n\n\"It's become clear that the next generation of services requires building full general intelligence,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Building the best AI assistants—AIs for creators, AIs for businesses and more—that needs advances in every area of AI from reasoning to planning to coding to memory and other cognitive abilities.\"\n\nThe announcements are a clear signal that Zuckerberg wants to position Meta at the forefront of developing consumer-facing AI products. This is important to Meta's investors, but perhaps more importantly, to talented engineers and machine learning researchers, many of whom are increasingly choosing to work for OpenAI or other well-funded AI startups.\n\nTo make more rapid progress towards this goal, Meta is combining Fundamental AI Research (FAIR), its advanced AI research division, which was founded over a decade ago, with the GenAI group it established just last year to help it build generative AI products, such as the celebrity persona chatbots it launched in September.\n\nThe move echoes Alphabet's decision last year to merge its two advanced AI research labs, Google Brain and DeepMind. Although neither Google lab was directly responsible for producing products, the rationale behind the merger was to enable Google to both create more capable AI models and to move those models into commercial production far faster than the tech giant had managed to in the past. The company was trying to catch up to Microsoft and OpenAI, which had beaten Google to market with a highly-capable AI chatbot in the form of ChatGPT and had also made the world's most powerful large language model, GPT-4, available to customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany technologists, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, predict that the next big platform shift in computing will be to personal AI assistants, which will become people's main interface to the digital world. These sophisticated AI chatbots will act as agents, performing tasks ranging from planning vacations to booking restaurant reservations, as well as composing letters and producing other types of content on demand. Zuckerberg clearly does not want to see Meta get left behind in this platform shift.\n\nMeta is in a high-stakes war for AI talent\n\nIt is also clear that much of Zuckerberg's announcement was aimed at the AI researchers and machine learning engineers that Meta wants to recruit and retain. The war for this specialized and high-priced talent is fierce, with Google reportedly doling out seven-figure stock grants to some top AI engineers and researchers to keep them from being hired away by OpenAI. And Zuckerberg told The Verge in an interview published today that his shift to talking about \"general purpose intelligence\" is designed to woo this rarefied talent. \"I think that’s important to convey because a lot of the best researchers want to work on the more ambitious problems,\" he told the publication.\n\nMeta has done important AI research over the years, in areas that range from unsupervised learning, where an AI system can learn patterns without labelled data, to AI software that can beat top humans at the complex strategy game Diplomacy. It has made big breakthroughs in machine translation and computer vision algorithms. Meanwhile, Meta's GenAI team developed Llama 2, a large language model that is among the most powerful open source AI models available. Although not quite as capable as OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's Gemini models, Llama 2 has become popular with developers looking to build sophisticated chatbots in a less expensive and more customizable way than building on top of OpenAI's or Google's models allows.\n\nBut the race for artificial general intelligence—or AGI, a single AI system that can perform most cognitive tasks that a person can—was historically never the company's main concern. Deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun, who founded FAIR and remains Meta's chief AI scientist, thinks AGI may be possible, eventually, but that researchers are a long way from achieving it. As for Meta's product teams, they were mostly interested in AI that was special purpose, not general purpose. It was designed to help the company with specific problems—how to automatically tag your friends in photos, how to recommend posts in your feed, and critically, how to weed out fake accounts and posts promoting extremism, terrorism, hate speech, self-harm, and misinformation.\n\nAt times, some Meta executives were downright dismissive of companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind that had the pursuit of AGI as their goal. Jerome Pesenti, who served as Meta's vice president of AI until the summer of 2022, famously dismissed AGI as \"technobabble\" that distracted people from more concrete goals, and problems, in machine learning. With today's announcement, Zuckerberg is now saying to machine learning researchers: We don't think it's technobabble anymore, please come and work for us.\n\nThat is also clearly why Zuckerberg mentioned the specific number of graphics processing units, or GPUs, the company is purchasing. These specialized chips, which are needed to create the most advanced AI models, are in short supply and serve as a big draw for top researchers and engineers. Meta will have 350,000 of Nvidia's most advanced H100 GPUs online in its datacenters and 600,000 \"H100 equivalents\" in computing power available when other GPUs are counted, Zuckerberg said. Meta may use some of Nvidia's older model GPUs for some applications and also uses is own custom-built AI chips.\n\nThe Verge cited chip industry analysts as estimating that Meta took delivery of 150,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs last year, a figure that tied with Microsoft's H100 deliveries and which is three times greater than any other Nvidia customer's. Google mostly uses custom built \"tensor processing units\" or TPUs for its AI models. But both Google and Microsoft need to share their H100 chips with the company's cloud computing customers. Meta, on the other hand, does not sell cloud computing infrastructure to other companies.\n\nIn his Reel, Zuckerberg also tried to tie the company's AI efforts to the metaverse, the virtual reality future that Zuckerberg had spent billions trying to reposition the company around but which has been eclipsed by the generative AI craze set off by ChatGPT's release in 2022. The Meta CEO said he believes augmented reality glasses will become a key part of how people interact with future AI assistants, since the glasses will enable the AI to see and hear the same things as the user and offer instant advice or additional helpful information and context. He said that the $300 camera-equipped smart glasses Meta launched in partnership with Ray Ban last year have been selling well and would get new AI features in the future.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

In the next phase of the case, US District Judge James Donato will decide on a remedy.\n\n“I have grave doubts that I am in any position to set a fee that developers might pay,” Donato said at a hearing Thursday as he discussed the litigation’s next steps with attorneys. “That’s beyond the canon of Article III judges.”\n\nThe verdict handed down by a San Francisco jury on Dec. 11 threatens billions of dollars in revenue for Google Play, which charges commissions of as much as 30% to software developers who typically have few other options.\n\nAt the time, Epic Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said his company would seek “actual changes in practice” to Google’s app store, but didn’t provide specifics about a potential remedy.\n\nDonato said he will give Epic and Google a chance to negotiate a settlement, and if they can’t come an agreement, he’ll hold a hearing in mid-March. The judge signaled that he wants input from expert economists.\n\nEpic largely lost a similar challenge to Apple’s app store in 2021. Both companies asked the US Supreme Court to review the dispute but the justices this week declined, without explanation.\n\nIn December, Alphabet agreed to pay $700 million to settle separate antitrust complaints brought by state attorneys general and consumers challenging Google Play policies.\n\nStory continues\n\nCorie Wright, Epic’s vice president of public policy, criticized the deal because it doesn’t limit the fees charged by Google. The accord instead calls on Google to change its Play Store policies to reduce barriers to competition for app distribution and payment processing.\n\nRead More: Google Play Deal Frustrates Critics of Steep App Developer Fees\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "title": "‘It’s the worst quality results on Google I’ve seen in my 14-year career’: Web search exec breaks down how ‘SEO parasites’ and AI-enabled spam are breaking the internet",
        "content": "Google search increasingly looks like it just isn’t working the way it used to.\n\nThe search engine that has become a 21st century staple in virtually everyone’s lives, used billions of times a day, is struggling with the unintended consequences of a recent update. Basically, it’s all spammed up. Welcome to web search’s junk mail era.\n\n“It’s the worst quality results on Google I've seen in my 14-year career,” says Lily Ray, senior director of search engine optimization at digital marketing agency Amsive Digital.\n\nPop-up windows, ads for spurious products, and links that are sure to download some impossible-to-remove malware are common on the internet. But one doesn’t usually see them interspersed in between websites on Google. With billions of searches a day to go alongside the countless websites on the internet Google can only catch so many of these scammers before they pop up again like a game of digital whack-a-mole.\n\n\"Right now, it feels like the scammers are winning,\" Ray tells Fortune.\n\nIn essence what happened, according to Ray, was Google released an update to its algorithm that pushed user generated content further up the rankings of its search results. The idea was that when users asked a question, they’d get to see answers from other real people who might have the answer, democratizing the web further and moving gatekeeper authority away from, say, news sites such as Fortune. Google called this the hidden gems update, implemented in a series of changes from May to November 2023, because it was ostensibly supposed to find the best answers from across the internet regardless of who had posted them. So if a user searched “what’s the best used muffler?” or “how to know if my homemade beer has gone bad?” they’d find answers from other people who had car trouble or were more experienced homebrewers.\n\nInstead what ended up happening is unscrupulous sites realized they could take advantage of the new policy by putting spam links in places Google’s new algorithm prioritized, according to Ray.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Google Docs, Google Maps, Linkedin, Reddit, anywhere you can imagine that there is a forum, spammers are taking advantage of it,” Ray says.\n\nA recent study from researchers in Germany that examined the quality of product review websites, previously reported on by 404 Media, is in line with Ray’s claims. The higher-ranked pages on the searches they conducted tended to have lower-quality texts and more affiliate links meant to monetize those sites, according to the research. Although, the quality of Google’s search did outperform that of its competitors Bing and DuckDuckGo. The company also had the most effective mitigation tactics compared to other search engines, although the spammers would also eventually find ways around those.\n\nAs Ray told Gizmodo about the state of web search: “I’ve never seen Google in such disarray.”\n\n‘SEO parasites’ leech off legitimate webpages\n\nThe reason some bad actors found it worthwhile to spam the new search update was because of something called affiliate links. They’re a common online practice whereby a website might earn a commission if a product gets bought after clicking a link featured on one of its pages. If a website with a lot of affiliate links can make it to the top of the pile on Google Search, that can be quite lucrative for whoever owns that website. And scammers try to take advantage of the rules to try and peddle worthless products via links on useless websites.\n\nJust getting into the prime positions on Google is a business unto itself known as search engine optimization, or SEO. Last year, SEO was a $76 billion business, according to market research company IBISWorld. It’s another very common practice for virtually any business that has an online presence (including every story this reporter publishes on Fortune.com). SEO has become a critical part of most online marketing and is considered a speciality in the advertising world. When done well, it ensures that the most relevant information surfaces to the most visible spots on Google.\n\nFor example, people living in an area where a hurricane is expected to make landfall would need trusted sources of weather alerts, like the National Weather Service or a local news outlet, at the top of their Google searches. The irksome side effect is that many search results now look the same. A simple search for something like “best bed sheets” turns up dozens of the same article with titles like “The 8 Best Sheets of 2024,” or “The 22 Very Best Bed Sheets,” or the more colorful “These Are Our Favorite Sheets to Catch Some Z's.”\n\nCritics of SEO would argue it’s turned online search into a homogenous experience where all the results reiterate the same information. Filterworld, a new book by New Yorker staff writer Kyle Chayka, argues that by now, roughly 30 years into a world changed by the internet, the power of the algorithm has gone beyond culture to curate countless everyday experiences into “feeds,” for example the oddly similar coffee-shop aesthetic around the world. On the other hand, supporters would say it's a way to reward the best websites, in particular if they’re small businesses who might not be able to afford huge advertising budgets for the paid spots at the top of Google’s search results.\n\n“The constant struggle of billion-dollar search engine companies with targeted SEO affiliate spam should serve as an example that web search is a dynamic game with many players, some with bad intentions,” the study's authors write.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said the study is flawed in that it only looked at certain search terms. “This particular study looked narrowly at product review content, and it doesn’t reflect the overall quality and helpfulness of Search for the billions of queries we see every day,” they told Fortune in an email.\n\nAnother problem that caused the quality of Google’s search results to decline, according to Ray, is what she calls \"SEO parasites\" who are “leeching off of big publishers.” This is when a trusted website leases out space on their site, and crucially their domain name, to third parties for sponsored content. These third parties capitalize on the traffic and respectability of the parent site to stuff their sponsored post with affiliate links. It’s technically allowed but just doesn’t make for a great experience.\n\n“People are exploiting loopholes on Google,”  Ray says.\n\nThe study from the German researchers also found that the prevalence of affiliate links could be correlated to lower-quality websites. “We further observe an inverse relationship between affiliate marketing use and content complexity, and that all search engines fall victim to large-scale affiliate link spam campaigns,” the study says. “However, we also notice that the line between benign content and spam in the form of content and link farms becomes increasingly blurry—a situation that will surely worsen in the wake of generative AI.”\n\nFrom the earliest days of AI, watchdogs warned it could be used to make scamming easier. AI-generated voice recordings could impersonate people or their loved ones as part of a ruse to gain access to their banking information or medical records. While in the case of online search, AI lets fraudsters make the sort of junk content that’s cluttering Google’s search results at an unprecedented scale.\n\nA Google spokesperson pointed Fortune to a post on X from Ray highlighting Google’s handling of a complaint about shady content hosted on a Harvard University URL, stating the company was working to “take steps to better deal with third party content of this nature.” Google’s account also specified that “was likely a case that the site is unaware this content has been placed on it rather than a purposeful attempt to host the content.”\n\nGoogle also acknowledged in its statement to Fortune that it has “launched specific improvements to address these issues [highlighted in the study].” Google noted that the study itself points out that Google Search has improved over the past year and is performing better than other search engines. “More broadly, numerous third parties have measured search engine results for other types of queries and found Google to be of significantly higher quality than the rest.”\n\nRay agrees that Google is aware of the problem and is working to address it, likely through a mix of updates to its user policy and to its algorithm. “Google always generally gets things right,\" she says. \"It just takes them time.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\n\nSamsung yesterday unveiled its new line of Galaxy smartphones, a release it hyped would usher in a new era of mobile AI. Tapping Google’s Gemini models as well as models Samsung itself created, the phones’ AI features include fairly impressive on-device translation for both calls and texts, but also a lot of what we’ve already seen in the new generative AI landscape: The ability to create a transcript from a voice memo, automatically summarize a meeting, organize notes, and so on.\n\n“Samsung has announced its new range of AI-powered Galaxy S24 flagship smartphones claiming a new era for mobile is opening up. Really? Well, not quite yet,” said Forrester VP principal analyst Thomas Husson in a note shared with Eye on AI after the event. Daishin Securities analyst Park Kang-ho similarly told the Financial Times, “I don’t think the added AI features are compelling enough.”\n\nThe most notable new feature is undoubtedly “Circle to Search,” which lets users search Google for more information about anything from within any app by simply circling it on their screen. In an on-stage demo, Google VP of Search Cathy Edwards showed how this could be used to search for a clothing item that catches your eye in an Instagram post. In another scenario, she received a text from a friend asking for thrift store recommendations in a particular location and simply circled the message to get instant search results overlaid directly within the text app—no typing or switching apps required.\n\n“You probably come across things in your apps all the time that you want to learn more about when you're immersed in a moment of discovery. It can feel disruptive to stop what you're doing and switch to another app to learn more. So today we're introducing a solution,” Edwards said, though it should be noted that the ability to search without apps doesn’t mean the search results are going to be any good. This capability is obviously a huge commerce opportunity and a potential driver for Google’s ad business, and if the results include ads, it “could quickly end up being more frustrating than efficient,” as Wired noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nEither way, Circle to Search hardly seems like a killer AI app, and it’s safe to say Samsung didn’t transform the smartphone into an AI-first device with this launch. It could, however, be laying the foundation for a new, more centralized way of interacting with smartphones that doesn’t hinge on jumping from app to app. It begs the question of what this means for all the companies that exist only as apps on our phones. It also leaves unanswered the question of how much the smartphone in its current form can be reoriented to fully embrace AI and what other kinds of devices could be next.\n\nAI obviously took center stage at the Consumer Elections Show (CES), which was held last week in Las Vegas and offered the first large-scale showing of AI-centered consumer hardware since OpenAI fired the AI starting gun in November 2022. One of the breakout devices of the show was the Rabbit R1, a pocket-sized virtual AI assistant. It has no screen or apps, and while it can’t fully replace our smartphones, it is meant to take over a variety of tasks we perform on them, from calling an Uber to making a dinner reservation on OpenTable.\n\nWhile not too dissimilar from Humane’s AI Pin—the much pricier screen-less, app-less wearable for interacting with LLMs that was met with heavy skepticism—the Rabbit R1 garnered a lot of positive interest, landing on several “best of CES”-type lists. We also know it’s not only under-the-radar startups that are chipping away at creating entirely new classes of devices. All eyes are on Apple, which will not only release a new, likely AI-featured iPhone in nine or so months but is also moving steadily into “spatial computing” (the fancy new buzzword for what used to be called augmented and virtual reality). Apple has a glowing track record of pioneering new devices, including the iPhone itself.\n\nThere’s no question Samsung was a bit overzealous in its declaration that its latest smartphones are a “eureka moment” for mobile AI. Maybe a future smartphone will deliver on this promise, or maybe it will require another device altogether.\n\nAnd with that, here’s more AI news, and also, a new section—Eye on AI Numbers—that will offer a quick take on a key figure, stat, or numerical fact pertaining to AI news. It's one of, ahem, a number of new sections we will be experimenting with in Eye on AI over the coming weeks. Let us know what you think!\n\nSage Lazzaro\r\nsage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.com\r\nsagelazzaro.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is developing a built-in \"Listen to this page\" text-to-speech capability for Chrome on Android.\r\n\r\nThe users will get a new \"Listen to this page\" option, which will open on Android’s three-dot overflow menu, launching a mini-player with a circular play/pause button, page title, site name, progress bar and close button.\r\n\r\nMoreover, tapping this option will open a sheet UI with a timeline scrubber, rewind/fast forward buttons, playback speed adjustment, highlight text & auto-scroll, and voice options.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming update is expected to improve the user experience and functionality of the Chrome browser, which, in turn, will likely increase the company's web browsing traffic.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Alphabet is expected to gain solid traction across Android users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Google Chrome Initiatives\n\nApart from the latest move, Alphabet introduced an Incognito mode in Google Chrome, which allows users to browse the web without any trace, removing browsing history and tracking data after closing the browser, a feature that some interpret as private browsing.\r\n\r\nEarlier, Alphabet added 120 features to Google Chrome, including Tab Groups for easy access on other desktop devices and Safety Check, which automatically runs in the background to alert users when saved passwords are compromised or harmful extensions are installed.\r\n\r\nGoogle also added a high-level shortcut to \"Clear browsing data\" on Android for Google Chrome, appearing in Chrome's main overflow menu. The feature allows users to remove specific browsing data increments, with the default being 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe company revamped its New Tab Page for Google Chrome, featuring a thicker search bar, bolder hint text, distinct voice microphone and Lens icons, and a smaller Google logo, similar to Gmail and Google Chat.\r\n\r\nGoogle also unveiled in-browser price insights across Chrome, allowing users to predict future price changes. The feature also features a 90-day price history graph, price drop emails and a new Shopping list folder.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo Conclude\n\nThe company’s growing endeavors to bolster its Google Chrome app will boost Google’s Search revenues. This, in turn, is expected to strengthen the Google Services segment that remains the key growth catalyst for Alphabet.

        "content": "Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia. Photo: Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters (©Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters)\n\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 gains (^GSPC) last year but can they repeat those extraordinary returns in 2024?\n\nThis group of mega-cap tech giants – Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) – are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing.\n\nIn 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500.\n\nHere’s what to expect as Tesla kicks off the mega-caps’ reporting season on 24 January.\n\nTesla (TSLA) – reporting on 24 January\n\nShares in Elon Musk’s EV maker doubled in value over 2023, gaining 102%, as the company is expected to report revenues of $25.5bn (£20.1bn).\n\nTesla has reported 485,000 deliveries for Q4 2023, marking an increase of about 20% versus the last year.\n\n“Tesla has already given insight into its performance via the quarterly vehicle production and delivery data released ahead of the financial results. In the fourth quarter it produced 494,989 vehicles and delivered 484,507 vehicles, the bulk of which were Model 3 or Y,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\n“It managed to hit a 1.8 million annual delivery target which effectively gave it breathing space amid market worries that competition was biting at its heels, particularly China’s BYD which surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles last quarter,” he added.\n\nThere are concerns around a stall in its automotive sales with no new model launch and delayed Cybertruck ramp-up.\n\nAnalyst forecast for the next set of quarterly results is $0.72 earnings per share.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – reporting on 30 January\n\nMicrosoft managed to steal the title of most valuable company in the world from Apple in 2024, with the software giant’s bet on AI paying off.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella has made a push for Microsoft to assume a global leadership role in AI. The company has a significant stake in leading AI startup ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, and reportedly invested up to $13bn in the startup.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis alliance has been considered one of the tech industry’s most lucrative tie-ups.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft’s market capitalisation stood at $2.895tn, a new record high for the company, and above Apple’s market cap of $2.825tn.\n\nThe last time the software giant earned the title of most valuable company in the world was back in 2021.\n\nThe consensus analyst forecast for the next set of quarterly results is earnings per share at $2.29 and revenue at $52.94bn.\n\nRead more: FTSE top trending tickers of 2023\n\n“The big issues are whether Microsoft can sustain robust growth in cloud computing and how it can take AI to the next level,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Seen by most as the dominant AI software play, its apps are already critical to millions of businesses, so wrapping functionality into Windows, Microsoft 365, Azure and more through its Copilot tools offers immense potential.\n\n“It is not all champagne and caviar for Microsoft. Its success has naturally attracted the attention of various regulators and competition authorities and like its mega cap peers, there are growing concerns that the company has become too dominant. Antitrust probes are likely to be a key focus for investors in 2024.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) – reporting on 30 January\n\nThe search engine giant appears to be playing catch-up in the AI race and announced hundreds of job cuts in an effort to reduce costs. But the stock is still a buy with most analysts given its powerful free cash flow.\n\nMost analysts are expecting Alphabet to report a 12% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, to $85.26bn, which should translate to a 51% increase in per-share earnings to $1.60, up from $1.05 in the same year-ago period.\n\n“Alphabet has beaten market expectations for both earnings per share and revenue over the past three consecutive quarterly results. Investors will be hoping it can make it four in a row on 30 January,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Cloud computing is the big unknown – one minute Alphabet is thriving in this area, the next it cannot sustain growth momentum. Competition is fierce and this is a difficult one to call ahead of the results.\n\n“YouTube continues to go from strength to strength, with millions of people now treating the platform as a priority place to consume content.\n\nApple (AAPL) – reporting on 30 January\n\nApple has taken overtaken Samsung (005930.KS)as the world’s biggest phone maker but that might not be enough to convince investors amid dwindling iPhone sales in China.\n\nApple added $1tn in market cap in 2023 even as it has reported revenue declines from the prior year in four consecutive quarters.\n\nAnalysts forecast Apple to report $2.09 earnings per share and $118bn revenue amid weakness in China and global waning demand for Mac computers and iPads.\n\n“The company used to have a reputation for bringing out truly innovative products and shaking up the marketplace. In recent years that reputation has soured as there have only been new iterations of the same products,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“The momentous change could be the Vision Pro headset which goes on sale in February 2024. While the $3,500 price point looks high, people pay that for high-end laptops and this could feasibly be another ‘must-have’ product for Apple fans.\n\n“The key issue to monitor is whether Apple’s output can meet demand as last year there were reports it had to drastically cut production forecasts for the Vision Pro due to the complexity of its design.”\n\nMeta Platforms (META) – reporting on 1 February\n\nIts year of efficiency, that saw the company pivot away from the metaverse push, allowed Meta to achieve a remarkable return of 194% in 2023.\n\nHowever, what can investors expect when Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook owner, sold almost half a billion dollars’ worth of the company’s shares at the end of last year. It was the first time he sold shares in almost two years.\n\nAnalysts forecast $4.96 earnings per share in Meta’s fourth quarter for 2023 versus a $1.76 per share loss in the same period a year earlier. Revenue is estimated be $39bn versus $34.15bn one quarter earlier.\n\n“The results are likely to include a reiteration that expenses are going to rise in 2024, driven by higher infrastructure-related costs and investment in AI. The hype around the metaverse has died down but it continues to plug away at the concept and any success from Apple’s Vision Pro headset could revive public interest in virtual worlds,” Coatsworth said.\n\nRead more: ChatGPT portfolio outperforms the UK’s top 10 most popular funds\n\n“Meta has a big folder of AI ideas such as language translation and Instagram users reimagining their photos, but these seem unlikely to generate meaningful revenue, so advertising will remain key in terms of income for the near future,” he added.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – reporting on 21 February\n\nAmazon saw its stock surge 81% in 2023 and is betting that generative AI will produce tens of billions in revenue for Amazon Web Services in the next few years.\n\nAmazon aims to be a dominant player in the market despite being slow to invest in this technology.\n\nThe company also has a strong position in TV, film and music streaming and although the stock is not inexpensive, shares are the cheapest they have been in over 10 years.\n\nAmazon has guided for net sales between $160bn and $167bn, equating to 7% to 12% growth versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The analyst consensus forecast is $0.78 earnings per share and $165.86bn revenue.\n\n“The uncertain economic outlook raises the prospect that companies are continuing to find new ways to save money including paring back IT costs which could be problematic for Amazon’s cloud computing division. Potentially offsetting this issue is greater corporate interest in AI which could benefit the group,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Amazon has been rolling out new versions of AI chips which it said offer enhanced performance and announced plans to invest up to $4bn in Anthropic, a US company generating AI systems and large language models. AI may be the ‘hot theme’ in tech but keeping up with rivals, let alone overtaking them, can be a costly exercise,” he added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – reporting on 21 February\n\nThe AI boom of these tech mega-caps would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year.\n\nWith demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year.\n\nThe analyst consensus forecast for its next quarterly results is $4.49 earnings per share and $20.06bn revenue.\n\nRead more: How AI boom will benefit these nine chipmakers in 2024\n\n“Nvidia is going all-in on AI, believing the world is on the cusp of a radical shift in technology usage. Companies in every industry are exploring ways to deploy AI to improve productivity and that creates a huge runway for Nvidia to grow its earnings,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Its key challenge is to keep up with demand and to keep innovating, rolling out new products that can help companies while also ensuring it remains at the forefront of the AI industry. Nvidia is the dominant force in market and there is no room for complacency, otherwise competition will be biting at its heels,” he added.\n\nWatch: Why tech will still be 'one of the leaders' in 2024<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/magnificent-seven-continue-dominating-markets-210500660.html\\\">nonstop talks of the Magnificent Seven and AI</a>.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has recently initiated another round of layoffs, impacting 100 employees at YouTube.\n\nThe downsizing follows a previous reduction last week, where the company laid off over 1,000 workers across various divisions, including engineering, services, and the Google Assistant team.\n\nA Google spokesperson explained that these layoffs are a strategic effort to concentrate on the company’s main goals and future opportunities, aiming to streamline efficiency and align resources with key product areas, TechCrunch reports.\n\nTubefilter initially reported the YouTube layoffs, which Mary Ellen Coe, YouTube’s Chief Business Officer, later confirmed in an internal memo. She described the job cuts as part of the restructuring within the creator management and operations teams.\n\nThe affected employees can apply for other roles at YouTube, but securing a new position is not guaranteed. These workers have a 60-day window to find new roles before their termination is finalized.\n\nAlso Read:Citigroup Navigates Tough Quarter with Revenue Dip, Plans Major Job Cuts\n\nThe Google spokesperson highlighted the company’s commitment to assisting the affected employees in finding new roles at Google and elsewhere.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai recently informed employees in an internal memo of impending job cuts in 2024. Following layoffs since January 10 across various departments, Pichai explained that these decisions are necessary to focus on major priorities, simplify execution, and increase speed in certain areas.\n\nHe indicated that further resource allocation decisions by some teams might lead to additional role impacts throughout the year.\n\nAlso this week, reports indicated Google is reducing the size of its advertising sales team, reflecting a broader pattern of job cuts at the tech giant.\n\nThis move underscores a growing trend of workforce reductions across different industries, where companies are more frequently adopting artificial intelligence software and automation for efficient task management.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January 2023, Alphabet declared plans to significantly downsize its workforce, intending to eliminate 12,000 positions, comprising 6% of its global employees.\n\nPrice Action: GOOG shares traded higher by 0.70% at $143.88 premarket on the last check Thursday.\n\nAlso Read: Is Amazon’s Twitch in Trouble?

        "title": "Does Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?",
        "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhat Is Alphabet's Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, Alphabet had US$12.9b of debt, at September 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$119.9b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$107.1b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Alphabet's Balance Sheet?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Alphabet had liabilities of US$86.3b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$37.2b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$119.9b and US$41.0b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$37.4b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis short term liquidity is a sign that Alphabet could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Alphabet boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, Alphabet grew its EBIT by 3.7% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Alphabet can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Alphabet has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 89% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Alphabet has US$107.1b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$78b, being 89% of its EBIT. So we don't think Alphabet's use of debt is risky. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Alphabet, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Sundar Pichai is taking a leaf out of Mark Zuckerberg’s book and warns Google staff ‘ambitious goals’ can only be met with job cuts",
        "content": "The tide has officially turned in Big Tech following the lockdown hiring spree: job cuts are coming thick and fast, with Google the latest in a long line of companies announcing redundancies in order to meet its goals.\n\nThe CEO of Google owner Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, told staff in an internal memo that slashing the roles was part of a wider decision to invest further into emerging technologies like AI: “We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,\" he wrote.\n\nThe memo, sent to staffers on Wednesday and seen by CNBC and confirmed by Fortune, is titled '2024 priorities and the year ahead' and reads: “The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices.” For some teams this will entail eliminating jobs, which Pichai describes as \"removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity.\"\n\nIt wasn't all doom and gloom from the Big Tech CEO though: Pichai said the cuts \"will not touch every team\" and added the layoffs will not be to the same scale as a similar action last year.\n\nGoogle did not confirm how many jobs will be cut, or where, when approached by Fortune for comment.\n\nGoogle staffers could be forgiven for feeling like they've been here before: in January 2023 Pichai issued a similar update announcing 12,000 roles would be cut. Pichai reasoned the action was a counter-balance to the hiring spree undertaken during Covid, writing: \"Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.\"\n\nIn the memo sent out this week Pichai promised more detail on the reason for the cuts, namely laying out what the business's goal is for AI. Google has pushed hard to catch up with rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, launching its Bard bot in February last year following the explosion of interest in ChatGPT a matter of months before.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle's adventure into large language models (LLMs) hasn't been seamless. A company event held early last year to showcase Bard went awry when the bot gave out inaccurate information—prompting shares in the company to nosedive and wiping $100 billion off its valuation in a single day.\n\nSubsequent reports further damaged Google's mission, including apparent concerns for staff about ethical lapses, a Google U.K. boss encouraging users to use the bot as a search engine as opposed to a source of information, leading to wider questions about the service's usefulness.\n\nDespite such hiccups, Google enjoyed a strong 2023 on the stock market, posting a 56% gain over the past 12 months as the so-called 'Magnificent 7' group enjoyed renewed interest on account of emerging technologies and a resilient consumer.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nPichai kicking off his year of ambition to make way for AI advancements might give analysts the feeling of being here before. In March last year Mark Zuckerberg announced 'Meta's year of efficiency,' which involved axing 10,000 roles and closing down hiring for an additional 5,000 staffers.\n\nSimilarly to Pichai, Zuckerberg said the cuts were being made in order to \"flatten our orgs\" and cancel \"lower priority projects.\" Again, the Facebook founder's motivation was clear and a blueprint of Pichai's, adding: \"Our single largest investment is in advancing AI and building it into every one of our products ... This work is incredibly important and the stakes are high. The financial plan we’ve set out puts us in position to deliver it.\"\n\nThe about-turn from mass hiring during COVID—in just 2020 and 2021 Microsoft, Alphabet, Salesforce and Meta, hired 126,170 people, a combined increase of 35%—wasn't difficult to predict. Meta workers hired as late as 2022 said they had to \"fight\" for work, while other Big Tech employees told Fortune they were paid six figures to do nothing—some even used company time to learn how to scuba dive.\n\nBoth Meta and Google were name-dropped by Silicon Valley VC Keith Rabois, who said the companies had hired thousands of people to do “fake work” to hit hiring metrics out of “vanity.” The DoorDash investor added: “There’s nothing for these people to do—it’s all fake work. Now that’s being exposed, what do these people actually do, they go to meetings.”\n\nMeta and Google aren't the only companies forced to axe their headcounts—the likes of Amazon and Salesforce also laid off thousands of people in 2023, bringing the total for the sector to a reported 240,193.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Microsoft’s Bing Market Share Barely Budged With ChatGPT Add-On",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When Microsoft Corp. announced it was baking ChatGPT into its Bing search engine last February, bullish analysts declared the move an “iPhone moment” that could upend the search market and chip away at Google’s dominance.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Pakistan’s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Singapore Minister Quits After Biggest Graft Case Since 1986 Dimon Says China Risk-Reward Equation Has ‘Changed Dramatically’\n\n“The entire search category is now going through a sea change,” Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said at the time. “That opportunity comes very few times.”\n\nAlmost a year later, the sea has yet to change.\n\nThe new Bing — powered by OpenAI’s generative AI technology — dazzled internet users with conversational replies to queries asked in a natural way. But Microsoft’s search engine ended 2023 with just 3.4% of the global search market, according to data analytics firm StatCounter, up less than 1 percentage point since the ChatGPT announcement.\n\nBing has long struggled for relevance and attracted more mockery than recognition over the years as a serious alternative to Google. Multiple rebrandings and redesigns since its 2009 debut did little to boost Bing’s popularity. A month before Microsoft infused the search engine with generative AI, people were spending 33% less time using it than they had 12 months earlier, according to SensorTower.\n\nThe ChatGPT reboot at least helped reverse those declines. In the second quarter of 2023, US monthly active users more than doubled year over year to 3.1 million, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of SensorTower mobile app data. Overall, users were spending 84% more time on the search engine, the data show. By year-end, Bing’s monthly active users had increased steadily to 4.4 million, according to SensorTower.\n\nTo build on the momentum, Microsoft has been adding more AI tools to Bing. In October, the company integrated the latest version of OpenAI’s image-generating model, DALL-E 3. Visitors can use it to create realistic-looking images with simple text prompts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe offering does nothing to enhance Bing’s search abilities. But its addition generated a spike in usage, according to Jordi Ribas, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of search and AI.\n\n“We noticed an increase in usage by 10 times and that took us by surprise because if you think about it, DALL-E 2 was already quite good,” he said in an interview. “It really made a difference in the engagement and the users that came to our product.”\n\nYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s consumer chief marketing officer, declined to specify how many active users Bing has.\n\n“Look, it’s still early days and new behaviors are being built,” he said. “We’re still learning new things, but have millions and millions of people using the new tools.”\n\nEven as the Bing team adds crowd-pleasers, Google has been racing to develop its own AI tools. In May, it launched an experimental version of its search engine called the “search generative experience,” which delivers conversational responses atop the familiar list of links. Dubbed SGE for short, it’s still not widely available. However, Google plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into SGE sometime this year.\n\nThe Alphabet Inc. division also retains considerable advantages. It has more than 90% of the market and is the default search engine on Apple Inc. hardware, including iPhones, giving Google crucial critical mass. The more people who use it, the more the search engine knows and the more Google can use that data to deliver and rank results in a way people find useful.\n\nThe retooling of search by both technology giants reflects a shared conviction that generative AI will fundamentally change the way people seek and receive answers online. For Microsoft, the shift is an opportunity to propel Bing forward. But the incremental gains so far make clear that buzzy AI features alone probably won’t transform it into a formidable search player.\n\n“We are at the gold rush moment when it comes to AI and search,” said Shane Greenstein, an economist and professor at Harvard Business School, who has studied the commercialization of the internet. “At the moment, I doubt AI will move the needle because, in search, you need a flywheel: the more searches you have, the better answers are. Google is the only firm who has this dynamic well-established.”\n\nStill, Greenstein said Bing, being the underdog, has more latitude to experiment. “Google has to be careful not to hurt its brand and product when it comes to testing new AI tools,” he said. “Bing can afford to take the risk. It has nothing to lose.”\n\nMicrosoft is also betting that generative AI will change how advertisers allocate their search spending. The current ad model rests on costs-per-click, but AI-powered searches are getting consumers to answers faster and more directly without a litany of blue links, according to marketing chief Mehdi.\n\n“We have advertisers telling us they’re getting better outcomes as a result of our AI efforts and are deeply interested in how this works,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

Google has expressed unwillingness to ban the song from its search engine without a court order.\n\nWhile a Hong Kong court blocked the government's injunction bid in July, a month later it allowed the city's government to appeal the decision.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is targeting double-digit growth for its latest flagship smartphone series, powered with an array of new artificial intelligence features.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Milei’s Younger Sister Is Also ‘The Boss’ Directing His Mission\n\nSouth Korea’s largest company on Wednesday unveiled the Galaxy S24 product family, the latest iteration of its most direct iPhone rival. The devices include built-in live translation of calls and a new search tool that lets users circle an image on the phone to get related information, tapping the AI suites of Samsung and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Samsung also sprung a surprise by previewing the Galaxy Ring, an upcoming health-tracking gadget.\n\nSamsung, which last year lost its top spot in global smartphone shipments to Apple Inc., is trying to secure an early lead in the race to integrate AI. It’s set itself the ambitious target of increasing sales of the flagship substantially, and is taking a hybrid approach of combining its own AI technologies with those of Google, according to TM Roh, head of Samsung’s mobile business.\n\n“What ultimately matters is the user experience,” Roh said in an interview with Bloomberg News in San Jose, California. “We are always open to collaboration with our partners on new areas of the mobile industry.”\n\nShares were mostly unchanged in Seoul early on Thursday, following the showcase event.\n\nRead More: Samsung Bets on Google-Powered AI Features in Smartphone Revamp\n\nPartnerships will be a major element in Samsung’s push. The company has worked closely with OpenAI backer Microsoft Corp. in the past and has a longstanding pact with Google around its Android operating system. Samsung and Google started the year by announcing they’ll reduce duplication in competing with Apple’s AirDrop by uniting around a single Android Quick Share feature.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Korean tech company, also the world’s largest memory chipmaker, spent 2023 digesting insights from its users and tailoring new AI features and additions to enhance the appeal of its latest device generation. While AI and machine learning have long been used on phones, the rise of tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a rush to deliver more sophisticated services directly on people’s devices.\n\n“The AI-related features can really bring convenience and could encourage consumers to switch their phones,” said Lee Changmin, an analyst at KB Securities. Some small-cap AI-related stocks in Korea already saw some gains before the S24 was unveiled and may move again after the launch, with the deciding factor being the quality of Samsung’s new added features. KB Securities analysts including Lee estimate that Samsung may see its best Galaxy S sales in eight years with its new generation.\n\nSamsung’s plans are not limited to the new handsets, as the company plans to roll out AI features to some of its earlier models in the Galaxy S series in the first half of this year, 55-year-old Roh said. The company recorded double-digit growth between its Galaxy S22 and last year’s S23 generation, giving it confidence it can repeat the feat.\n\nBut the global smartphone market has been in the doldrums for years and was again down last year. Samsung’s own shipments declined by 13.6% in 2023, according to IDC estimates. Roh expects both to rebound in 2024, as the advent of AI injects some much-needed excitement into the category. Many consumers are also due for upgrades following a sales boom in 2021, with the typical upgrade cycle now being roughly three years, he added.\n\nRoh, like some market estimates, expects the global smartphone shipments to expand by around 5% to 6% this year, though he hopes to outperform the consensus with Samsung’s new devices.\n\nAfter ceding ground to Apple last year, Samsung sees room to regain its position. That’s because AI — even while it risks consumer fatigue with excessive hype — is not a fad, Roh said. Like the era of the internet and smartphones, AI signals a seismic shift in our relationship with technology, which may reorganize the industry’s leadership, he said.\n\n“The S24 marks just the beginning of a new era when AI technologies go mainstream,” Roh said. “Hopefully it will help revitalize the global mobile industry.”\n\n--With assistance from Youkyung Lee.\n\n(Updates with shares and analyst reaction)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "TSMC’s $59 Billion Rally May Extend on AI Demand: Tech Watch",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A rally in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. may get a fresh push as renewed optimism over artificial intelligence offsets concerns on China relations after Taiwan’s presidential election.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Milei’s Younger Sister Is Also ‘The Boss’ Directing His Mission\n\nShares of the world’s largest foundry have rallied 12% from a September low, adding $59 billion to its market value, as investors bet on a recovery in the global chip industry after more than a year of inventory correction. Daily call options volume on TSMC’s American depositary receipts has been building recently on bullish bets ahead of the company’s earnings report due Thursday.\n\nStill, the shares remain 15% below their record level set two years ago, even as its global chip peers and A-list clients including Nvidia Corp. have regained all-time highs on AI hype and the gradual rebound in broader chip demand. Given the muted geopolitical reaction to the Taiwan leadership vote, some investors expect a catch-up in TSMC, with the average price target implying a gain of 20% over the next year.\n\n“We hope this one issue is now out of the way and this name could finally break out given its unquestionable dominance in AI chip production,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a strategist at Asymmetric Advisors Ltd. TSMC shares may rise further on low valuations combined with the company’s better-than-expected sales and likely price hikes, he added.\n\nWorld Chip Sales Return to Growth in Sign of Improving Demand\n\nThe consensus forward earnings estimate for TSMC has climbed back to a record high, as the company beat fourth-quarter revenue expectations. The stock has 35 buy ratings versus two holds and no sells.\n\nAs the contract manufacturer of the 5-nanometer semiconductors designed by Nvidia, TSMC is seen as a prime beneficiary of the AI boom. While a recovery in smartphone demand has been slow to get off the ground, Apple Inc. is adopting the company’s more advanced, and higher priced, 3-nanometer chips in its latest iPhones.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC rallied with global chip stocks since autumn before losing some steam since the start of the year on concerns over friction with China resulting from Taiwan’s election. The presidency was won by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s Lai Ching-te, who is seen as a “separatist” by China, though his party lost the control of the parliament.\n\nLai has supported TSMC’s decision to expand manufacturing overseas, saying it strengthens the company’s as well as Taiwan’s influence internationally. Beijing has so far had a muted reaction to Lai’s victory, reiterating its opposition to the island’s independence.\n\nWhy Making Computer Chips Has Become a New Arms Race: QuickTake\n\n“I believe there will be minimal effect on TSMC” from the election, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum. “Lai’s victory suggests a continuation of Taiwan government’s semiconductor-focused economic growth strategy.”\n\nUpcoming results may highlight negative impacts from spending on factories in the US and elsewhere, as well as the strengthening of the Taiwan dollar and risings labor costs. But relative cheapness is seen supporting the stock, trading at 15 times forward earnings estimates compared with a five-year median of 18 times and Nvidia’s 28 times.\n\n“We like TSMC as we think its solid technology leadership and execution better position it vs peers to capture the industry’s long-term structural growth, particularly in areas such as 5G or AI,” Goldman Sachs Inc. analysts including Bruce Lu wrote in a note, adding that its valuation remains attractive.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAn index that tracks volatility in the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index jumped to the highest in more than two months on Wednesday after a pair of strong US economic reports boosted speculation the Federal Reserve will be in no hurry to cut interest rates, weighing on tech stocks. The Cboe NDX Volatility Index rose as much as 8.6%, hitting the highest in about two months. The spike comes after a lull in volatility that saw the index drop to the lowest since 2019 a month ago.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. is targeting double-digit growth for its latest flagship smartphone series, powered with an array of new artificial intelligence features. Apple Inc.’s iPhone dethroned Samsung Electronics Co. devices to become the best-selling smartphone series over the course of 2023, the first time South Korea’s largest company has lost the top spot since 2010. Verizon Communications Inc. is writing down the value of its business services division by $5.8 billion, a sign of the company’s declining enterprise operations. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is rolling out a series of broad changes to some of its core search, browser and data products in Europe, in order to step in line with the European Union’s new rules to rein in Big Tech’s market dominance. Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic is working on a feature that would give its chatbot Claude the ability to analyze images, according to unpublished wording contained in the code of the company’s website. The tool could widen the product’s appeal to users and help the company catch up with larger competitors. Rivian Automotive fell after Deutsche Bank downgraded the electric-vehicle maker to hold from buy, citing downside to 2024 volume and margin outlooks. Google DeepMind, Alphabet Inc.’s research division, said it has taken a “crucial step” towards making artificial intelligence as capable as humans. It involves solving high-school math problems.\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.\n\n(Updates first chart)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "If 2023 was the year companies poured money into generative AI, 2024 is the year they’re hoping those investments start to pay off. From Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Samsung and even Volkswagen and Mercedes, businesses are quickly monetizing their generative AI offerings as interest in the technology among consumers and enterprise customers remains red hot.\n\n“We expect 2024 to be a year of increased promotion and initial adoption and 2025-27 to be when the markets may take off from further applications to take advantage of the features as many key elements come together,” analysts with UBS’s Global Research and Evidence Lab wrote in an investor note on Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Samsung debuted its line of Galaxy S24 smartphones complete with the company’s Galaxy AI package of generative AI capabilities including live translation and photo editing features. On Monday, Microsoft announced that it will begin selling subscriptions for a consumer version of its Copilot AI assistant for $20 per month per user.\n\nThe tech giant also said it is opening up the enterprise version of its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to small and medium businesses. It previously only sold the service to businesses with more than 300 employees. Sam Altman, left, appears onstage with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at OpenAI's first developer conference, on Nov. 6, 2023, in San Francisco. (Barbara Ortutay/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIntel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) are selling chips with their own neural processing units for AI apps; PC makers are joining the fray by marketing their laptops and desktops as AI ready; and at CES 2024 Volkswagen said it’s bringing ChatGPT to its in-car voice assistant by the middle of the year.\n\nNow companies just need buy-in from consumers.\n\n“Is there a killer app? Is there a demonstrable application or change that will then make people pay essentially more? I think that is something [companies] will struggle with,” Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut that’s not stopping businesses from taking a chance on what could be the next great technological leap.\n\nTime to put up\n\nIf you followed the developments at CES 2024 earlier this month, you know that seemingly every tech-adjacent company on earth is using AI as a means of marketing their products.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow it’s up to the companies that are making real AI products to deliver on the promise that the technology will truly change our lives for the better.\n\nThe problem for companies, Atwal says, is that generative AI products offer consumers cumulative benefits rather than a single mind-blowing app that’s easy to sell people on.\n\n“It's a combination of elements that … will make the device easier to use. It will make you more productive. So everything becomes kind of cumulative,” he said. “Cumulative is very, very difficult to monetize.” Samsung's Intelligent Summary feature uses generative AI to, well, summarize content from the web. (Samsung) (Samsung)\n\nWhile selling the average consumer on generative AI products may prove tough, enterprise customers are already on board.\n\nAccording to Microsoft VP and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi, 77% of people in enterprises who have used the company’s Copilot business software say they would never want to give it up. Microsoft’s Copilot for Microsoft 365 currently costs $30 per user per month, the same price as Google’s own enterprise offering, Duet AI for Workspace Enterprise.\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilot Pro will test consumers’ appetite for paid generative AI services. So will the so-called AI PC, the PC industry’s marketing designation for laptops and desktops outfitted with neural processing units designed to power AI applications.\n\nSo far, chipmakers like Intel say neural processors will benefit the average consumer by running generative AI apps on their personal devices rather than in the cloud, helping to improve overall privacy and security.\n\nBut beyond that, they say we’ll have to wait to see what kind of apps developers cook up before we'll know what AI PCs are truly capable of. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to UBS’s Global Research and Evidence Lab, though, it’s just a matter of time before consumers get on board.\n\n“We think the motivations, use cases and technology enablers for [generative AI] on edge devices are aligning for initial highend adoption in 2024 and mainstream penetration from 2025-27,” UBS analysts wrote in a research document.\n\n“This has the potential to stimulate positive mix changes [spending on higher priced products] (driving requirements for more processing, storage and upgraded peripherals), and could also pull in replacement cycles as new devices offer increased usefulness, enabling content creation, productivity, and personalization.”\n\nIt’s now up to tech companies to keep customers interested in the benefits of generative AI if they hope to make anything back on their investments.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk",
        "content": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently briefly surpassed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the highest-valued company in the world; it has very sound management focused on shareholder returns, which is elicited in the financial statements. Its largest contributor to growth will likely be artificial intelligence, which places it in direct competition with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as a peer with the most advanced capabilities in the industry. Particularly, both companies are focusing on artificial intelligence integrations for retailers, creating tension over market share.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nWhile Microsoft has valuation risks, it remains a strong growth stock considering its operational strengths. However, its above-index returns are largely dependent on AI success, with considerable regulatory risks that could inhibit stock growth and create volatility. Nonetheless, the company remains one of the safer ways to gain exposure to AI.\n\nRetail AI operations and Google competition\n\nMicrosoft has introduced generative AI and data solutions for retailers, with a focus on personalized shopping experiences. A copilot template for Azure OpenAI Service assists with engaging customer interactions. As an example, Canadian Tire Corp. (CDNAF) is launching an AI shopping assistant to aid customers in purchasing automotive products.\n\nThe company is also integrating generative AI into tools used by store associates and managers with the intention of enhancing productivity and customer service. Voice-enabled task creation and real-time access to insights and information should further improve retail efficiencies.\n\nMicrosoft Fabric is a unified analytics platform for unlocking retail data, improving the planning and design of data solutions and driving forward AI-driven retail analytics.\n\nThe company is also integrating models of GPT-4 Turbo on Azure OpenAI Service, increasing the broad range of applications due to the partnership with OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo counter Microsoft's retail AI progress, Google Cloud has launched new GenAI products, which are aimed at personalizing online shopping experiences and making back-office operations more efficient. Conversational Commerce Solution and Catalog and Content Enrichment use advanced AI models to enhance engagement and automate content creation.\n\nAdditionally, Google introduced an AI Hypercomputer, which integrates software, hardware and machine learning. It improves productivity and efficiency and includes support for various machine learning tools such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Its recent launch of Gemini, a new AI model that is statistically the most advanced in the world right now, accompanied its AI Hypercomputer developments.\n\nBoth Microsoft and Google seem to be competing directly, but taking nuanced approaches to their respective projects. As such, the competitive risk to Microsoft is both arguably enhanced and reduced by Google's abilities, as larger traction in the AI market will drive awareness of Microsoft's tools as well. As I mentioned, statistically based on 30 out of 32 academic benchmarks, Gemini is above OpenAI's ChatGPT at current in terms of technical proficiencies.\n\nFinancial analysis\n\nMicrosoft is arguably strongest in the area of profitability, with industry-leading margins that should increase further as operational efficiencies get stronger due to AI. This is largely expected due to reduced headcount in specific sections of the business as automation takes over human labor. The company's net margin is 35.32% at the moment, which is better than 97.28% of companies in the software industry, according to GuruFocu' data. The gross margin is also an impressive 69.44%. Google has a net margin of 22.46%, significantly lower than Microsoft's, and Google's gross margin is only 55.88%. This positions Microsoft in a very strong position to invest further in advanced AI.\n\nFor its first quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported $56.5 billion in revenue, which is a 13% year-over-year increase. Its operating income was $26.9 billion, a 25% increase. Its net income was $22.3 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $2.99. Revenue for the company's Intelligent Cloud segment increased 19% year over year, with server products and cloud services revenue increasing 21% due to Azure; other cloud services growth was 29%. The company's Intelligent Cloud segment, largely responsible for its AI initiatives, is the greatest component of the organization's revenues: Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk\n\nMicrosoft's balance sheet is also quite strong, with 50.49% of its total assets balanced by total liabilities and 49.51% balanced by total equity for the last trailing 12 months. Total equity has risen from 31.96% in 2018, showing considerable financial prudence on the part of the management team. The company has also issued more debt in the last 12 months, with $22.515 billion in net issuance. However, its total cash flow from financing over the period is -$18.291 billion, largely due to dividend payments and stock repurchases, showing continued investment in shareholder returns.\n\nValuation concern\n\nThe largest weakness with an investment in Microsoft is its valuation, which is no surprise as it briefly became the world's most valuable company with a market cap of around $2.89 trillion, surpassing Apple's market cap of around $2.87 trillion. Microsoft has a forward price-earnings ratio of around 35, compared to Apple's ratio of 28 and Google's ratio of 21.\n\nAssuming Microsoft maintains its strong annual earnings per share without NRI growth rates, which have increased from 17.50% as a 12-year average to 22% as a five-year average and 19.40% as a three-year average, the stock could be considered moderately overvalued at present based on my discounted cash flow calculation. By taking a moderate estimate of a 19% annual earnings per share without NRI growth rate for the next 10 years, which I think is conservative but would price in inhibitions such as regulatory constraints on progress in AI, the fair value of the stock is around $336, approximately a 15.5% downside on the current stock price of around $388.\n\nThe discounted cash flow analysis assumes a 4% growth rate for a 10-year terminal stage following the 19% growth period and a 10% discount rate. Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk\n\nBy a different method, the GF Value chart shows the stock to be fairly valued, and so investors must realize they are not allocating capital to undervalued shares, but instead to a high-growth enterprise that particularly shines on profitability and has operational strengths already priced in. Microsoft: Retail AI Operations Indicate Continued Growth Amid Valuation Risk\n\nRisks\n\nThe company might see significant inhibition to its earnings and revenue growth if regulatory hurdles slow down retail AI operations. In addition, there are severe security risks associated with the transfer and collection of data crucial to advanced AI practices in retail and other workplaces. As a company focused intently on artificial intelligence for its continued growth, I think investors should expect periods of slower growth as markets accustom themselves to new technologies related to AI. Microsoft will potentially be at the forefront of case studies related to policy and regulation in jurisdictions around the world.\n\nIn addition, even if the stock is fairly valued, this means there is no margin of safety if the AI industry performs less promising than expected. The hopes and estimates for the industry are well-founded, and Grand View Research estimates an annual growth rate of 37.3% for the sector from 2023 to 2030. By 2030, the AI market is projected to be worth over $1.3 trillion, but some volatility on the way to this high estimate is likely and should be expected, in my opinion.\n\nConclusion\n\nI think Microsoft is one of the most stable ways to gain exposure to AI, particularly as it is also diversified beyond these operations. The company's venture into retail AI and its partnership with OpenAI make a strong foundation to compete with Google to become the dominant player in the field. Its financials are sound with exceptional margins and the main real risk to consider is a potentially overvalued stock. My rating for the stock is buy.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Google will lay off several hundred employees on its advertising-sales team in another round of cost-cutting measures, the company said.\n\nThe layoffs come as Google plans to restructure its advertising-sales unit, reducing a team that focuses on large clients while expanding teams dedicated to small and medium businesses.\n\n\"Every year we go through a rigorous process to structure our team to provide the best service to our Ads customers,\" a Google spokesperson told FOX Business. \"We map customers to the right specialist teams and sales channels to meet their service needs. As part of this, a few hundred roles globally are being eliminated and impacted employees will be able to apply for open roles on the team or elsewhere at Google.\"\n\nIn a memo to staff, first reported by Business Insider, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler wrote that hundreds of people will be let go as Google restructures its advertising-sales unit.\n\nGOOGLE LAYS OFF HUNDREDS OF WORKERS Google plans to restructure its advertising-sales unit as a cost-cutting measure.\n\nGoogle plans to move staff from large-consumer sales, a team that focuses on large advertising clients, to its Google customer-solutions team, which services small and medium-level clients. Current and former employees told Business Insider the shift comes as some of Google's large clients do not need access to as many of the company's resources.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe spokesperson said the shift is not unusual and, while larger than a similar restructuring during the pandemic, not unprecedented.\n\n\"Going forward GCS will be our core channel for scaling growth by dynamically delivering the right treatment to every customer — while LCS will focus on transformational growth for our largest, most sophisticated customers,\" Schindler wrote in the memo reported by Business Insider.\n\n\"While I'm confident we're doing the right thing for our customers, partners, and ultimately for our business, this will be very hard for many, especially across our LCS teams,\" he added later.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOGLE LAUNCHES ADVANCED AI MODEL ‘GEMINI’ In this photo illustration, the Google Bard logo is seen.\n\nGoogle is also reportedly attempting to use AI products, like Performance Max, to automate tasks on its advertising-sales teams, such as determining how advertisers' money should be spent across products, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe layoffs, which mostly impact the large consumer sales team, are not related to AI, according to Google.\n\nEarlier this month, Google announced that a few hundred employees working on the company's voice assistant unit and another few hundred people working on the augmented reality hardware team would be laid off. A few hundred roles within its central engineering team are also impacted.\n\n\"We’re responsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,\" a Google spokesperson told FOX Business. \"To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, and to align their resources to their biggest product priorities.\"\n\nGOOGLE SHOWS OFF LATEST AI TOOLS AT CES Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google Inc., speaks during an event in New Delhi on Dec. 19, 2022.\n\nGoogle's layoffs come as tech firms including Amazon, Microsoft and Meta seek to maximize operational efficiency to compete in the AI space. Last month, Google rolled out its latest AI software, Gemini, which seeks to compete with Microsoft-backed OpenAI's GPT-4 model and Amazon's in-development \"Olympus\" software.\n\nAmazon laid off several hundred employees in its streaming and studio operations last week.

        "title": "Samsung debuts generative AI-focused Galaxy S24 smartphone lineup",
        "content": "Samsung is bringing generative AI technologies to its new Galaxy S24 line of Android-powered smartphones. The features, which include the ability to instantly translate audio between users and edit phones, among other things, are part of Samsung’s Galaxy AI suite of artificial intelligence capabilities. Samsung says it has also teamed with Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) to take advantage of its Gemini AI model for a handful of AI offerings.\n\nThe $799 Galaxy S24, $999 Galaxy S24+, and $1,299 Galaxy S24 Ultra go on sale on Jan. 31 and serve as the kickoff to what is expected to be a broader push among consumer tech companies to monetize the generative AI boom. Samsung is banking on its Galaxy AI offerings to boost sales of its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones. (Image: Samsung) (samsung)\n\nAll three of the phones get the same AI features, ensuring that you’ll be able to use those functions regardless of whether you opt for the entry-level S24 or the top-of-the-line S24 Ultra. Generative AI capabilities include the ability to quickly summarize content from web pages; Live Translate, which allows you to instantly translate phone calls from one language to another; and Transcript Assist, which will let you record a conversation and automatically detect when different speakers are talking.\n\nPhoto editing functions include the ability to manipulate subjects in images, allowing you to, say, move a person from one side of the shot to another, and the option to zoom out of an image and use generative AI to fill in the background.\n\nOne of the breakout features of the Galaxy S24 line is Circle to Search, which allows you to circle on-screen items and then quickly search for them via Google search. So if you see a photo of a cool location while scrolling social media, you can circle it on your screen and get more information about it via Google.\n\nGoogle’s Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro have or are getting many of the same features as the Galaxy S24 line as well. But Google’s smartphones don’t have nearly the market share as Samsung’s, meaning the S24 line will likely serve as the first time many consumers gain access to on-device generative AI.\n\nStory continues Samsung's Intelligent Summary feature uses generative AI to, well, summarize content from the web. (Image: Samsung) (Samsung)\n\nThe Galaxy S24 is just one of a series of devices and products tech giants are launching in 2024 to take advantage of interest in generative AI. PC makers are adding generative AI to their laptops and desktops via new chips and a new keyboard key for Microsoft’s (MSFT) AI-powered Copilot. And even automakers are getting in on the action with Mercedes (MBG.DE) and Volkswagen (VWAGY) adding ChatGPT to their vehicles in the coming months. Mercedes’ offering will be a beta.\n\nBut Samsung’s Galaxy S24 line provides more than amped-up AI tricks. The S24 and S24+ come with 6.2-inch and 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x displays, respectively. Those are a hair larger than the displays found on the S23 and S23+, which measure 6.1 inches and 6.6 inches. Like the S23 Ultra, the S24 Ultra comes with a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display.\n\nAll three phones now offer display refresh rates of between 1 and 120Hz, which means they can speed up the number of frames you see per second to 120 frames for smooth animations or drop the refresh rate down to 1 frame per second to save on battery life.\n\nOn the camera front, Samsung has outfitted the S24 and S24+ with a trio of lenses, including a 50-megapixel wide-angle lens, a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, and a 10MP telephoto lens. The telephoto lens gives you up to 3x optical zoom. The S24 Ultra, meanwhile, gets a 200MP wide-angle camera, a 12MP ultra-wide angle camera, and a 10MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom as well as a 50MP telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThat’s actually a step down from the 10x optical zoom Samsung used in the S23 Ultra, but in reality, it will likely prove more useful, considering that at 10x zoom, trying to get your subject into the frame becomes rather difficult when even the slightest twitch of your hand throws off the framing.\n\nAll of this is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. In terms of memory, the S24 gets 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage. The S24+ and S24 Ultra both get 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. The S24 Ultra also gets the option for 1TB of storage.\n\nAdding generative AI elements to the Galaxy S24 line gives Samsung a hot new technology to help market its latest smartphones. Over the last few years, the smartphone market has, in general, felt rather stale. After all, there are only so many incremental changes you can make to a phone’s camera or screen before consumers start to tire of them.\n\nWith Galaxy AI, Samsung has the chance to make generative AI the linchpin for its smartphones for the next few generations. But the company will have to deliver on its AI promises and continue to build on them moving forward if it’s going to get consumers hooked and keep them clamoring for more.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is turning to artificial intelligence features to revamp its flagship Galaxy smartphones, betting that the technology can give it an advantage over Apple Inc.’s iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap China Population Extends Record Drop on Covid Deaths, Low Births JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Trump Back in White House? Lagarde Says ‘Let Me Have Some Coffee’\n\nAt its Unpacked conference Wednesday in San Jose, California, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S24, S24+ and S24 Ultra phones, which all add AI tools based on the Gemini technology from Alphabet Inc.’s Google. The devices can live-translate phone calls, transcribe voice recordings, summarize web articles, fix handwriting and use generative AI to fill in parts of photos.\n\nThe launch is one of the most ambitious attempts to weave AI into a smartphone’s interface and features. The new devices also provide Google with a chance to put its most advanced software in the hands of more users, a potential edge in its fight for AI dominance with Microsoft Corp. and startup OpenAI.\n\nThe AI features are the highlight of the new phones, but the devices are also getting slimmer bezels and brighter displays. Samsung is paying special attention to its top-end model, the S24 Ultra. That product, which starts at $1,299, will have a new titanium frame, matching the iPhone 15 Pro models released in September.\n\nThe borders around the displays are 42% thinner, and the screen is 40% brighter than the phone’s predecessor. It also sports flatter edges and a front-facing camera cutout that’s 11% smaller.\n\nThe $799 S24 and $999 S24+ come in aluminum and get slightly larger screens than their predecessors, moving from 6.1-inch and 6.6-inch panels to 6.2-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The S24 Ultra, like the S23 Ultra, has a 6.8-inch screen.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm Inc. is providing the main chip of the new Samsung phones in at least some regions. The S24 lineup will be based on its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 applications processor, the company said in a separate statement. That component offers the latest Wi-Fi capabilities and will handle AI-assisted features such as live translation and transcription, Qualcomm said.\n\nThe new models come at a crucial time for Samsung, which is contending with market share losses and a broader smartphone slump. Last year, it lost its crown as the No. 1 smartphone supplier to Apple, marking the first time Samsung hasn’t led the market since 2010.\n\nSamsung’s phone shipments declined nearly 14% to 226.6 million units in 2023, according to research firm IDC. Apple, on the other hand, saw unit shipments increase 3.7% to 234.6 million.\n\nSamsung looks to reverse its fortunes by getting a several-month head start on AI. Apple isn’t expected to showcase its latest plans for artificial intelligence until June, ahead of new iPhones arriving around September. The new Galaxy phones come out on Jan. 31, with preorders starting Wednesday.\n\nRead More: Apple Faces AI, China, App Store Challenges in 2024\n\nSamsung decided to adopt the Gemini AI technology after surveying offerings from competitors, according to Thomas Kurian, head of Google’s cloud computing unit. As part of a multiyear agreement, Google will be the sole provider of generative AI for Samsung’s phones and applications, including features for taking notes and recording audio, according to Kurian.\n\n“This is a validation of the quality of our models,” Kurian said. “They were free to choose whoever they wanted.”\n\nUsers will be able to switch between two options: one called Gemini Nano that runs on the phone itself and a higher-powered Pro version that uses cloud computing. That flexibility helped Google’s offerings stand out from the competition, Kurian said.\n\nIn conjunction with Samsung’s announcements, Google also introduced a feature called “Circle to Search,” which lets people search anything on their phone screens without switching apps. Users of Google’s Android operating system can scribble or circle on top of images, text or video in the app they’re on – say, YouTube Shorts or TikTok – to find out more information about the item. The feature is launching globally on the new Galaxy S24, as well as on Google’s own Pixel 8 smartphones on Jan. 31.\n\nAI features on the Samsung devices will also let users change the language of a message depending on the context, such as whether it’s a work memo or social media post. And new capabilities for Android Auto — Google’s in-car interface — will summarize incoming text messages and other alerts.\n\nThe companies are also applying AI to the phones’ camera systems, which are getting upgraded with new sensors, with tools to make photos sharper. The S24 Ultra replaces one of its 10-megapixel telephoto cameras with a 50-megapixel version. The S24 and S24+, meanwhile, include the same camera specifications as their predecessors.\n\nThe S24 Ultra comes with as much as 1 terabyte of storage, while the S24+ tops out at 512 gigabytes. The S24 has as much as 256GB of space. The S24+ and S24 Ultra include 12GB of memory, which is used for shorter-term storage of data, while the regular S24 has 8GB.\n\n--With assistance from Ian King and Yoolim Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal Patti LaBelle Moves From Stage to Stove With a Recipe for Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "AI buzzes Davos, but CEOs wrestle with how to make it pay",
        "content": "By Jeffrey Dastin\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Bright banners tout the promise of artificial intelligence along the main promenade of Davos, but executives at the World Economic Forum (WEF) say they are grappling with how to turn early demos into money-makers.\n\nThe arrival of OpenAI's viral ChatGPT triggered a frenzy of venture investment and an abrupt change of course inside the world's biggest technology companies since late 2022.\n\nThis year, several CEOs at the WEF meeting in Davos told Reuters that the latest generative AI still has a lot to prove.\n\nCloud and internet security company Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told Reuters that the months ahead may even feel like an \"AI letdown\".\n\n\"Everyone's like, yeah, I can build these cool demos, but where's the real value?\" he said, echoing a theme among business leaders attending the WEF meeting.\n\nChatGPT's rapid rise is in some ways an outlier.\n\nIn the first two months since its November 2022 launch, the chatbot reached an estimated 100 million users, making it one of the fastest growing applications in history.\n\nThe program brought so-called generative AI to consumers' fingertips, letting people write a short prompt and generate a poem, school essay or gather information as if with a search engine. It also proved a good collaborator for developing ideas in \"low stakes, not business-critical use cases,\" said Victor Riparbelli, CEO of AI video generation startup Synthesia.\n\nBut \"the enterprise is definitely not really ready\" for this chat-based AI, he said in an interview.\n\nOne problem Riparbelli cited is there is no clear path to end so-called \"hallucinations,\" or false content generated by AI. While computer scientists have developed methods for constraining places from which chatbots can draw responses, business leaders may not want the risk.\n\nOther concerns, said IBM's Europe, Middle East & Africa Chair Ana Paula Assis, are stopping chatbot AI from reproducing human biases, and regulation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Clients are still very worried about how they bring those solutions within the boundaries of regulations and compliance,\" she said.\n\nPremier Li Qiang of China said in Davos that AI has to serve the common good but must be appropriately governed, because it \"poses risks to security and to our ethics.\" And China's President Xi Jinping wants the United Nations to play a central role in AI discussions, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, some 90% of 1,400 C-suite executives said they were waiting for generative AI to take a step beyond recent hype or were doing only limited experimentation and pilots, survey results published by consultancy BCG showed.\n\nBig tech companies including Microsoft, Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com have pressed ahead, courting thousands of businesses to give the latest AI a try.\n\nSome have marketed message-drafting, meeting-summarizing AI as a way to save employees time. Google, which has long used AI in its products, is experimenting with a chatbot-like collaborator it calls Bard.\n\nAnd Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at a company event in Davos Wednesday that AI is poised to grow productivity and potentially accelerate science itself.\n\nYet businesses' revenue and profit from recent efforts remain unclear.\n\n'GET REAL ABOUT AI'\n\nWhile one Davos sign exhorted passers-by, \"Let's get real about AI,\" efforts to find a market for it have led developers to consider diverse places.\n\nCohere, a high-profile AI startup that is focused on enterprises, views helping salespeople as one revenue path.\n\n\"It's going to be on the sales side and making sales teams more productive,\" Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez told Reuters. The hope would be \"helping them do more outreach, more follow-ups, and automating a lot of that process.\"\n\nBy contrast, medicine is more complicated. While speeding up note-taking for doctors is a worthy task for AI, automating the medical profession is not, as this could risk lives, said Gomez.\n\n\"We should be focused on assisting humans, not replacing doctors and having a chatbot doctor,\" Gomez said.\n\nNovartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan said the drugmaker was working with Microsoft with the aim of more widely rolling out AI to give samples to staff who submit 20 to 30,000 regulatory responses a year. The \"next opportunity,\" he said at Microsoft's event, would be AI for drug design.\n\nTejpreet Chopra, CEO of BLP Group, a major wind and solar operator in India, told Reuters he is ready to incorporate AI chat technology \"but only for internal use for writing good English, not for content.\"\n\nElections are a high-stakes area concerning AI companies, as voters around the world head to the polls in 2024.\n\nRegarding the use of AI in misinformation campaigns, Gomez said Cohere's policies prohibit impersonation, while Riparbelli said Synthesia does not allow customers to make political content through its AI video platform.\n\nOpenAI, which also bans abusive impersonation through its technology, on Monday said it is working with the National Association of Secretaries of State in the U.S. and will start directing users to CanIVote.org for election-related questions.\n\nUnderstanding how content is created is a key concern among companies and policymakers, said Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\n\"If (people) see a video or an image, they should be able to know whether it is AI-generated or human generated,\" Prabhakar told Reuters in an interview.\n\nFor Srini Pallia, an executive at technology services and consulting company Wipro, the AI buzz at Davos is loud and clear, filling the void left by crypto.\n\n\"You know the conversations - it's AI, AI and more AI,\" Pallia said.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google DeepMind, Alphabet Inc.’s research division, said it has taken a “crucial step” towards making artificial intelligence as capable as humans. It involves solving high-school math problems.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken Stranded After Boeing 737 Breaks Down on Davos Trip Stocks Drop as Solid Data Fuel Fed-Pivot Repricing: Markets Wrap China Population Extends Record Drop on Covid Deaths, Low Births JPMorgan Says Hacker Attempts Have Increased This Year Trump Back in White House? Lagarde Says ‘Let Me Have Some Coffee’\n\nIn a paper published in Nature this week, DeepMind introduced a system called AlphaGeometry that proves complex geometry theorems better than prior computer programs. Researchers at the company described this as a major breakthrough of an AI applying reasoning and planning to tasks, something even today’s advanced models can’t do — but something scientists believe is necessary for a hypothetical future artificial general intelligence, or AGI.\n\n“I considered this one of the grand challenges for AI,” Quoc Le, a distinguished scientist at Google and one of the paper’s co-authors, said in an interview. “A couple years ago, I would have said it was impossible.”\n\nLast year, Google merged its research division with London-based DeepMind to better compete in the high stakes race to build AI products. Google invested heavily in the technology for years, but was widely seen as falling behind in the emerging field of generative AI, chiefly to OpenAI and Microsoft Corp. In December, Google released Gemini, an AI model that underpins its chatbot Bard and which the company says can outcompete OpenAI’s GPT-4 in certain benchmarks.\n\nThese generative AI tools are quite good at chatting naturally or producing images, but they struggle with planning or handling problems that require several steps, said Le. That’s why they’re bad at solving geometry and other advanced mathematics. In the Nature paper, AlphaGeometry tackles a set of problems from the Mathematical Olympiad, an international competition, performing nearly as well as the top high-school competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI systems have struggled with this largely because there’s not enough available data to train them to learn on their own — unlike chatbots, which can glean information from the abundant text online. To solve this, DeepMind fabricated its own dataset, creating 100 million unique examples of geometric constructs for the AI system to absorb. Making this so-called synthetic data is expensive: Google’s scientists deployed 100,000 central processing units for three days to create the dataset. The company declined to share the cost.\n\nAlphaGeometry will not be immediately incorporated into Gemini, but Thang Luong, another co-author, said he imagines the system could eventually help serve as a mathematics tutor within services like Bard. Google has faced criticism for not moving some its research advances into commercial products quickly enough.\n\nGoogle decided to open-source AlphaGeometry, giving the code and model freely to others — an approach that potentially increases the risk of the technology being misused by bad actors. Le said he was not concerned about this in light of the company’s risk assessment of the system and the current progress of the science. “If you look very closely at AI today and what it can do, you’d be surprised that it’s not very good in the field of mathematics,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal Patti LaBelle Moves From Stage to Stove With a Recipe for Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

These changes will result in the removal of some features from the search page, such as the Google Flights unit,\" it said.\n\nRival comparison sites have been among the most vocal critics of Google's search practices, with a complaint last decade resulting in a 2.42-billion-euro ($2.63 billion) EU antitrust fine.\n\nOther changes in the coming weeks will allow Android phone owners to easily switch their default search engine or browser and users of Google services and products to move their data to a third-party app or service.\n\nEuropean users will see an additional consent banner to ask them whether some Google services can continue to share data targeted ads.\n\nGoogle warned that some businesses and users may not be happy with its proposals, which are still subject to changes ahead of March 7.\n\n\"While we support many of the DMA's ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, the new rules involve difficult trade-offs, and we're concerned that some of these rules will reduce the choices available to people and businesses in Europe,\" it said.\n\n($1 = 0.9204 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Mark Potter)",

        "content": "Investors have been preoccupied with interest rates over the past year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve raised interest rates at its fastest rate in many years. This caused steep selloffs in many sectors of the stock market. For companies with heavy debtloads or high capital intensity, higher interest rates could be an existential risk.\n\nFor other companies, however higher interest rates are no big deal. The following seven companies all have long-term debt to equity ratios of 0.1 or less, meaning that they have pristine balance sheets. For these seven steady stocks, the future looks bright regardless of the Federal Reserve’s next move.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe big tech companies are in an interesting place when it comes to interest rates. Some analysts had suggested that the tech firms would sell off thanks to higher interest rates as investors would move money to other opportunities. By and large, however, this hasn’t happened, at least among large and highly profitable companies.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the perfect example. The search giant has $120 billion of cash and short-term investments compared to just $12 billion of long-term debt.\n\nIf anything, Alphabet benefits to a degree from higher interest rates, as its $120 billion cash and short-term investment pile can earn a decent rate of return. If Alphabet parks that money in treasury bonds yielding 4% a year, for example, that would generate about $5 billion in annual interest for the company.\n\nIt’s true that higher interest rates were a punishing blow to speculative unprofitable tech companies. But the tech titans with fortress balance sheets have little to worry about.\n\nFranco-Nevada Corp. (FNV) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

Momentum Stocks.\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nFranco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) is a leading precious metals streaming company. Streamers essentially work as specialty finance companies; they provide upfront money to mining companies and receive a portion of the gold or other metals that are ultimately produced from a mine going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis has been highly successful. In fact, FNV stock has rallied more than 600% since 2007.\n\nHowever, the company recently hit a bump in the road. That’s due to a dispute in Panama between First Quantum and the Panamanian government. Right now, the mine is shut down as a result. Franco-Nevada earns a significant chunk of its revenues from that mine, and it could be years before the mine is reopened and/or they receive compensation from international arbitration.\n\nRegardless, FNV stock has now fallen by significantly more than the actual value of that royalty contract. In addition, the price of precious metals such as gold have been ticking up, which suggests that FNV shares should be trending higher as well. Franco-Nevada has no debt, and serves as a wonderful hedge to the current economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nCorteva (CTVA) A Corteva (CTVA) sign in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock\n\nCorteva (NYSE:CTVA) is a leading seed and crop protection company. It provides the cutting-edge seeds and associated fertilizers, herbicides and other such products to keep crops healthy. In addition, it offers software and digital solutions to help farmers enhance their crop yields.\n\nCTVA stock surged in 2022 as crop prices soared in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That reversed course in 2023, however, and CTVA stock is down more than 25% over the past year.\n\nInvestors can take advantage of that dip. Shares are now going for around 17 times forward earnings, which is a fair price for this agricultural company that has virtually no net debt and a treasure trove of intellectual property around its key seed varieties and crop protection products.\n\nAmbev (ABEV) website image for ambev\n\nSource: Anton Garin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmbev (NYSE:ABEV) is Brazil’s largest beer brewing company. In addition to its home Brazilian market, it has dominant market share in Argentina and several other Latin American countries.\n\nThe company operates as a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD). Investors might instantly dismiss Ambev due to the parent company’s problems.\n\nBut the Brazilian operation has no debt, unlike its parent which is highly-levered. In addition, craft beer hasn’t made nearly the same dent in the South American market as it has in the United States. Furthermore, Ambev has avoided the sorts of cultural controversies that derailed Bud Light sales in the United States last year.\n\nABEV stock trades for just 15 times forward earnings. And shares offer a greater than 5% dividend yield today making it a leading steady stock in a defensive industry.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) ODFL logo on the side of a train\n\nSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL) might seem like an odd pick for a steadfast company not affected by interest rates. Trucking is a highly cyclical business, and the firms in this industry tend to be highly levered.\n\nHowever, Old Dominion has built a different model. It avoids debt; in fact, it had just $60 million of long-term debt as of its last quarterly report. And on the asset side of its balance sheet, it owns and operates 11,274 tractors, 31,252 linehaul trailers, and 14,315 pickup and delivery trailers as of year-end 2022. That’s a tremendous amount of equipment to have with virtually no debt.\n\nThe company is also different because it focuses on less-than-truckload (LTL) services. This is more of a specialty than traditional trucking and can lead to higher profit margins. The business model has delivered tremendous results, with ODFL stock rising more than 900% over the past ten years.\n\nEPAM Systems (EPAM) The logo for Epam Systems is seen on the side of an office building.\n\nSource: Tricky_Shark / Shutterstock.com\n\nEPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) is a leading IT outsourcing company.\n\nSpecifically, the company came about thanks to a clever realization. EPAM could hire affordable IT professionals in countries such as Poland and Ukraine and have them fulfill contracts with Fortune 500 companies at high prices, earning an outsized spread on these deals.\n\nThis business model has worked tremendously; EPAM stock is up about 700% over the past 10 years. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused a disruption. At the time, EPAM had almost half of its staff in countries impacted by the war. It had to pause growth, relocate much of its staff, and hire additional workers from other markets such as Latin America.\n\nNow, though, EPAM has adjusted to the new geopolitical reality and is back in growth mode. And with large companies looking to manage costs, EPAM’s affordable IT solutions look more enticing than ever. Additionally, EPAM has a large cash balance and no debt, making it resilient against higher interest rates.\n\nTradeweb Markets (TW) a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word \"Buy\". bill ackman stocks\n\nSource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.com\n\nFinally, there is one other sort of business that can thrive regardless of where interest rates go. This would be the market makers and trading venues where people trade bonds and other interest rate products.\n\nFor example, Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW) offers software that allows traders to operate in fixed income and related markets digitally. For years, bonds were the last major asset class to stick primarily to phone-based trading as bonds tend to be more complex and differentiated securities than equities or currencies.\n\nHowever, the pandemic forced much of the bond trading market to go online as well. And now, thanks to the rising volatility in interest rates, Tradeweb is enjoying record prosperity. The company posted 28% growth in average daily volume for 2023, including a stunning 43% rise in December 2023 trading volumes. This makes Tradeweb quite the steadfast stock to own regardless of interest rate gyrations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in EPAM, ABEV, CTVA, and FNV stock.

        "content": "Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff acknowledges there will be a lot of good created from generative AI, but perhaps some not so good things that need to be kept in mind and discussed with global leaders.\n\n\"I think AI has to be almost a human right,\" Benioff said on Yahoo Finance Live Wednesday at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. \"I've actually been saying that for decades that AI could be a creator of inequality. It could also be a creator of equality.\"\n\nAt this year's annual WEF gathering of top leaders, the upsides — and downsides — of AI has been a hot topic. Most of the debate has been centered around AI's impact on job markets and potential for greater inequality.\n\nAbout 40% of global employment is exposed to AI, according to a new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In advanced economies, roughly 60% of jobs are exposed to AI due to the prevalence of \"cognitive task\" oriented jobs.\n\nOverall exposure is 40% in emerging markets and 26% in low-income countries, the IMF said.\n\nAlthough many emerging markets and developing economies may experience less immediate AI-related disruption, the IMF reasons they are also ready to capitalize on AI's advantages. This could \"exacerbate\" the \"digital divide\" and \"cross-country income disparity,\" the study concluded.\n\nIMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva told Yahoo Finance Live that older workers could see an outsized impact from AI's widespread adoption and may be in need of better social safety net.\n\n\"I think that AI is going to change a lot of what we do. I think there's going to be a lot of displacement of some people's jobs that are like with almost any technology that comes out,\" Cloudflare (NET) co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nOther big-name leaders have stopped short of proclaiming doom and gloom spurred on by AI, however.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I have found it's a real productivity increase,\" Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in an exclusive Yahoo Finance Live interview in Davos, Switzerland, on Monday.\n\nAdded Gates, \"Likewise, for coders, you're seeing 40%, 50% productivity improvements which means you can get programs [done] sooner. You can make them higher quality and make them better. So mostly what we'll see is that the productivity of white-collar [workers] will go up.\" Davos 2024\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "3 Billionaire Fund Managers Are Betting on 1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. It's Not Too Late to Follow Their Lead.",
        "content": "America's billionaire fund managers are living proof that the stock market is an incredible wealth generator over the long term. Many of them continue to invest today, and their hedge funds, family offices, and holding companies are required to report their positions each quarter, making it easy for everyday investors to follow their lead.\n\nSteven Cohen (net worth $19.8 billion), Stanley Druckenmiller (net worth $6.2 billion), and Bill Ackman (net worth $4.1 billion) each made most of their fortunes by investing their clients' money -- and their own -- in stocks and other financial assets.\n\nThe three billionaires are currently investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, and they have one holding in common. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCohen, Druckenmiller, and Ackman are betting on Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is the parent company of Google, which operates the world's leading internet search engine and the third-largest cloud computing platform. It's also home to streaming giant YouTube, and Waymo, a developer of autonomous self-driving vehicles.\n\nAs of the latest regulatory filings for the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30):\n\nPoint72 Asset Management, which is run by Steve Cohen, owned 552,101 Alphabet Class A shares and 105,374 Class C shares worth a combined $86 million. Duquesne Family Office, which is run by Stanley Druckenmiller, owned 838,375 Class A shares worth $109 million. Pershing Square Capital Management, which is run by Bill Ackman, owned 4.3 million Class A shares and 9.3 million Class C shares worth a combined $1.8 billion.\n\nGoogle is the window to the internet. It has a 91% market share when it comes to search, so it's fair to say it can access more data than almost any other platform (of any kind) in the world. Data is the nectar of any AI model, which is why Alphabet is quickly becoming a leader in the emerging AI industry.\n\nAlphabet stock is remarkably cheap right now, and here's why investors should take this opportunity to buy in.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is developing industry-leading AI models\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, one of Alphabet's tech-sector rivals, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), announced a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, a leading AI start-up and ChatGPT creator. The chatbot can create text, images, videos, and even computer code, and Microsoft immediately started integrating it into its product portfolio.\n\nThe integration of ChatGPT into Microsoft's Bing search engine grabbed the most attention early on, because investors feared it would become a viable competitor to Google -- after all, with a 91% market share, it had everything to lose. Traditional search engines require the user to sift through web results for the information they seek, whereas a chatbot provides direct responses, which is far more convenient.\n\nBut Alphabet has worked on AI for years, even if its product portfolio wasn't overtly reflecting it prior to 2023. It allowed the company to quickly launch a ChatGPT competitor called Bard, and it has since released an even more advanced model called Gemini.\n\nThe latter is more powerful than OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models by most multimodal benchmarks. In other words, Gemini's ability to understand, interpret, and generate text, images, videos, and code is more advanced.\n\nAlphabet is in the process of monetizing its AI models by weaving them into popular products like Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Plus, the traditional Google search engine uses AI to deliver direct answers to queries by placing them at the top of the page, which creates a more convenient user experience.\n\nAlphabet is generating record amounts of revenue\n\nAlphabet will report its official full-year results for 2023 in late January. It's expected to have generated a record-high $305 billion in revenue with $5.74 in earnings per share, representing year-over-year growth of 8% and 25%, respectively.\n\nAdvertising revenue generated by Google Search and YouTube rebounded in the most recently reported third quarter (ended Sept. 30), after businesses spent much of 2022 and early 2023 cutting their budgets in the face of elevated inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nGoogle Cloud remains the fastest growing segment for Alphabet, and it's a big point of focus for investors. That's because AI will eventually touch every aspect of our lives, and the majority of the applications we will use in the future will be developed in the cloud. Operators of centralized data centers (like Google Cloud) have been preparing for this shift by building AI infrastructure.\n\nThat infrastructure runs on leading AI data-center chips from providers like Nvidia. But Google has been developing its own chips like the new TPU v5p it released in December. It's a tensor processor designed to speed up the training of AI models, and the company says it was used to develop Gemini.\n\nGoogle Cloud also offers business customers more than 100 third-party large language models (LLM), which are the building blocks of AI applications. Developing an LLM from scratch takes considerable time, data, and financial resources, so using a ready-made solution can accelerate the adoption of AI for businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet stock is cheap\n\nInvestors love a good deal, and successful billionaires like Cohen, Druckenmiller, and Ackman know how to spot one.\n\nWhile Alphabet's full-year results for 2023 are still pending, its $5.74 in expected earnings per share (EPS) would place its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.8. For perspective, the Nasdaq-100 technology index -- which is home to all of Alphabet's big-tech rivals -- trades at a P/E ratio of 30.1. Therefore, Alphabet stock trades at a 17% discount to its peers.\n\nMicrosoft stock trades at a P/E ratio of 37.6, so Alphabet stock would have to soar 51% just to catch up. I'm not suggesting it will, because Microsoft's cloud business is substantially larger than Alphabet's, and that's where investors appear to be attributing the most value. However, there is certainly scope for Alphabet to trim the gap.\n\nAlphabet is set for another record year of revenue and earnings, according to Wall Street's 2024 estimates, so it isn't too late to buy the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

How Scientists Are Preparing for the Next Pandemic Bonds Slide as Fed’s Waller Downplays Need to Rush: Markets Wrap\n\nPoor protection of minority shareholders and heavy taxes, such as levies on inheritance that can reach as high as 60% for holders of listed firms, are two main causes behind Korea’s market discount, President Yoon Suk Yeol said. And the country’s top financial regulator said officials are seeking ways to boost the prices of stocks trading below book value.\n\n“To fundamentally resolve the ‘Korea Discount,’ we need to share the understanding that the excessive taxations undermine the stock market and cause damage to the middle class and ordinary people,” Yoon said during a conference Wednesday that was broadcast live on television and YouTube channels. “We need bold tax reforms,” he said, noting that most citizens own stocks unlike in the past.\n\nCompanies listed in South Korea have persistently traded at lower prices versus their overseas peers. The benchmark Kospi trades at 0.89 times its book value, compared with benchmarks in Taiwan and Japan, which both trade above 1.\n\nInvestors have pointed to poor corporate governance that favors controlling shareholders’ interest at the expense of minority shareholders as the primary cause. The hefty inheritance tax, which motivates controlling shareholders to keep the share prices artificially low, was also blamed.\n\nFinancial Services Commission Chair Kim Joo-hyun said the nation is considering ways to encourage Korean companies trading below book value to come up with voluntary measures to boost their share prices, speaking at the same conference.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan, where the stock market has been rallying to multi-decade peaks, recently found some success with a similar idea. The stock exchange last year called on listed companies to work to boost their valuations. Investors say the move has prompted some companies to use their cash more actively, by increasing share buybacks, issuing dividends and doing mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday published a list of companies that have complied with its voluntary request to come up with plans to improve capital efficiency, a move seen aimed at tapping peer pressure on companies that are reluctant to change.\n\nBack in South Korea, investors didn’t appear to pay too much heed to the remarks from Yoon or Kim. The Kospi fell to the lowest levels in more than a month amid heightened geopolitical risks and earnings worries.\n\nREAD: Tokyo Bourse Mulls Naming Firms With Capital Improvement Plans\n\n--With assistance from Hideyuki Sano.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Market Roars Back to Life—With Old-Timers Leading the Way Chinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Elon Moves Further Right; Hertz Ditches Tesla Patti LaBelle Moves From Stage to Stove With a Recipe for Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "US Supreme Court declines to wade into Apple's dispute with Epic Games",
        "content": "The US Supreme Court declined to take up dueling appeals from Apple (AAPL) and “Fortnite” developer Epic Games.\n\nIn an order issued Tuesday, the court announced it would not grant either of the two appeals that asked the justices to reconsider a ruling that impacts Apple’s control over its lucrative App Store. As a result, an appellate court ruling mostly favoring Apple, though requiring it to make some changes, will stand.\n\nIn the appeals case, the Ninth Circuit upheld a California trial court's ruling, holding that while the trial court erred in its analysis, Epic nonetheless failed to show that Apple held an illegal monopoly in a relevant market.\n\nConsequently, the court said, the tech giant did not violate federal antitrust law — a result that spared Apple from having to break up or divest its closely guarded App Store.\n\nThe decision isn't all upside for Apple, however. The Ninth Circuit's ruling revives an injunction that requires the smart phone behemoth to allow developers to include links and buttons in their apps that direct users to pay for app purchases outside the App Store.\n\nThe injunction puts billions in revenue in jeopardy for Apple. The company, which holds roughly 15% of the global smartphone market, earns fees on in-app purchases created by more than 30 million iOS app developers. The Ninth Circuit said at the time of Epic's trial against Apple that the number of video games on Apple's operating mobile system had grown from 131 in the early days of the iPhone to over 300,000. These gaming apps, the court said, generated an estimated $100 billion in annual revenue.\n\nThe appeals court said Epic failed in its case by not adequately showing that Apple's App Store qualified as a relevant app market. The court went on to say that Epic also failed to introduce some substantially less restrictive means by which Apple could maintain its iOS ecosystem.\n\nIn a minor win for Epic, the Ninth Circuit also let stand US District Court Judge Gonzalez Rogers’s determination that Apple had violated California’s Unfair Competition law. To remedy the violation, the court ordered Apple to allow Epic and other app developers offer alternative in-app payment methods.\n\nStory continues\n\nEpic had hoped the Supreme Court would take up its broader claim that developers should be able to get their apps onto iPhones through third-party app stores in addition to Apple's App Store.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court's decision not to hear Epic's appeal helps Apple by ensuring it keeps its App Store intact, the court's decision not to hear Apple's appeal could seriously bruise the tech giant. Apple benefits handsomely from the 15% and 30% fees it charges app developers on the sale of products through its App Store when using Apple's payment service.\n\nIf app developers can offer their own payment options in apps, they can bypass Apple's fees, cutting into the company's App Store revenue. Developers could sweeten the deal for consumers by selling apps and in-app products at a discount, since they won't have to make up for Apple's fees any longer.\n\nApple doesn't break out its App Store revenue numbers, but rather includes them as part of the company's overall services business. That segment, which also includes subscriptions for products like Apple TV+ and Apple Care, generated $85.2 billion of Apple's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. Failed to make his case: Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. (Getty)\n\nThe Epic-Apple dispute began more than two years ago when “Fortnite,” with about 350 million registered players, was booted from Apple’s and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) app stores and banned from their operating systems.\n\nThe bans were a response to Epic’s gaming program, which circumvented the platforms by offering direct in-game purchases at a 20% discount. Apple and Google both said the move violated their terms of service, justifying removal from the stores.\n\nEpic then filed separate lawsuits against Google and Apple with nearly identical allegations that the removals violated federal and California antitrust laws.\n\nWhile the two cases center on what level of control tech giants should have over the third-party developers, a jury came to an opposite conclusion in the case that went forward against Google.\n\nIn a jury trial, jurors sided with Epic, finding that Google had abused the dominance of its Android operating system app distribution and in-app billing markets by extracting exorbitant fees from Epic and other third-party app makers. A separate portion of the trial to determine a remedy for the violation is scheduled to take place later in January. A final outcome, however, is likely years away, as Google is expected to appeal the case.\n\nWhile Apple prohibits users from installing apps on their iPhones from outside the App Store, Google's Android lets users install apps from third-party app stores, albeit after forcing them to make changes in their device's settings menu and read a warning about doing so.\n\nApple's App Store is facing pressure from governments around the globe. Regulators from South Korea and Japan to the UK and EU have or are looking into ways to make the iPhone maker open up its devices to allow third-party app stores on its devices or provide alternative payment options in apps.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision to not take up the Epic and Apple appeals could also impact the US Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into Apple’s App Store and other business lines.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court refused to consider Apple Inc.’s appeal in an antitrust suit challenging its lucrative App Store, a decision that will likely affect billions of dollars in revenue for the iPhone maker.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBonds Slide as Fed’s Waller Downplays Need to Rush: Markets Wrap Iowa Latest: Haley Unveils New Ad, Looking to New Hampshire Trump Scores Easy Win in Iowa With DeSantis a Distant Second What Is Disease X? How Scientists Are Preparing for the Next Pandemic Musk Pressures Tesla’s Board for Another Massive Stock Award\n\nThe decision lets stand a 2023 appeals court ruling that found Apple’s business model didn’t violate antitrust laws, but that it did violate California’s Unfair Competition Law by limiting the developers ability to communicate about alternate payment systems that may cost less. The decision applies nationally and the iPhone maker must start letting developers tell users about cheaper payment options.\n\nBoth Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. had asked the court to hear an appeal related to the case. The justices turned down both appeals without explanation.\n\nApple shares slid as much as 2.7% after the court’s announcement before paring their decline. The stock was down 1.8% to $180.93 at 12:06 p.m. in New York.\n\nThe high court’s decision ends a temporary stay in the case and lets developers start directing iPhone users to cheaper purchasing options outside of Apple App Store via buttons or links to outside websites. Apple charges developers a commission of as much as 30% for digital goods and services sold through its App Store. The change will allow developers to bypass Apple’s system and offer links to cheaper alternatives.\n\n“As of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said in a thread on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nApple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillions of dollars are at stake. In app spending is forecast to reach $182 billion this year and $207 billion in 2025, according to research firm Sensor Tower. And competitors are ready to steal a piece of it: Microsoft Corp. has said that it’s already in talks to launch a mobile app store focused on gaming.\n\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals last year largely affirmed a lower-court judge’s 2021 decision largely rejecting claims by Epic that Apple’s online marketplace policies violated federal antitrust law because they ban third-party app marketplaces on its operating system. But the appeals court also upheld a federal judge’s ruling that the iPhone maker’s practices don’t violate federal antitrust law, rejecting the bulk of Epic’s case against Apple’s App Store.\n\nThat decision had been on hold while the Supreme Court appeals were pending.\n\nThe Epic case was the first to challenge Apple’s lucrative App Store system, which rakes in billions of dollars each year. In the interim, the company has come under serious pressure around the world, including in Europe where competition enforcers have two antitrust cases pending against the tech giant. EU authorities are expected to fine the company later this year for allegedly using its App Store rules to thwart music-streaming rivals like Spotify Technologies SA.\n\nIn a separate Epic suit in December, a jury found that Alphabet Inc.’s Google unfairly wields monopoly power in its Android app store. Google has said it plans to appeal, but key legislation in Europe, investigations in the US and UK and an expected wave of follow-on lawsuits will keep pressure on the tech giants’ app store duopoly.\n\nThe cases are Apple v. Epic, 23-244, and Epic v. Apple, 23-337.\n\n(Updates with Epic comment in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal There’s a Toxic Employee—and the CEO Is Ignoring the Issue Patti LaBelle Moves From Stage to Stove With a Recipe for Success How AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top Priority Trumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "By Aditya Soni and Chavi Mehta\n\n(Reuters) - Big Tech's \"Year of Efficiency\" may be over but recent layoffs at Google and Amazon have signaled the firms will keep cutting jobs in 2024 as they make big investments in generative AI.\n\nAnalysts and industry experts believe the layoffs would be smaller and more targeted this year, with firms that are racing to catch up in the AI race more likely to make such moves to offset the billions of dollars they are spending on the tech.\n\nAlphabet suggested that last week, saying it plans to invest in its \"biggest priorities\" as the Google parent laid off around a thousand employees across multiple divisions, including in its voice assistant unit and team responsible for Pixel and Fitbit.\n\nEven its advertising business was not spared, with a report on Tuesday saying that hundreds of jobs were being cut at the unit.\n\nAmazon.com laid off several hundred employees in its streaming and studio operations last week. Hundreds of jobs were also cut in its Twitch live-streaming platform and Audible audiobook unit, according to media reports.\n\nOverall, tech firms have let go more than 7,500 employees so far in January, according to tracking website Layoffs.fyi.\n\n\"No company wants to get left behind by the AI revolution and they are all making sure they have these capabilities and are prioritizing them, even when it is at the expense of other initiatives,\" D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said.\n\nBoth Google and Amazon are aggressively investing in their AI efforts. Google, which is trying to close the gap with Microsoft in the AI race, last month unveiled its long-awaited Gemini model, while Amazon is developing a model codenamed \"Olympus\" to compete with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's GPT-4 model.\n\nHIRING PRIORITIES\n\nStill, the total size of the layoffs is expected to be much smaller, compared with last year's massive cuts, as tech spending picks up on the back of a more stable economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech sector shed 168,032 jobs in 2023 and accounted for the highest number of layoffs across industries, according to a report by Challenger, Gray and Christmas earlier this month.\n\nThose were led by tens of thousands of cuts at tech giants including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg termed 2023 as the \"Year of Efficiency\".\n\n\"I don't think there will be a similar reckoning. (Last year) tech firms were shedding all these employees they hired during the pandemic,\" said GlobalData analyst Beatriz Valle.\n\n\"AI is driving a lot of dynamism but this only means that tech companies will be changing their hiring priorities.\"\n\nSome tech firms have been offering hefty salaries for AI roles, with a report saying last year that Match's Hinge dating app was looking for a vice president of AI with a base salary of up to $398,000 a year and that Amazon was offering a top salary of $340,300 for a senior manager of applied science and genAI.\n\nThe spending is expected to deepen investor expectations on the returns from genAI, but the payoff for most companies could take longer to play out, according to analysts and experts.\n\nSo far, only Microsoft and chip giant Nvidia have emerged as big winners from the boom.\n\nDaniel Keum, an assistant professor of management at the Columbia Business School, said past evidence shows it can take a decade or more to profitably make money from new technologies.\n\n\"The question is 'is it different this time for AI?' I am pessimistic, but many smart people believe it will be much shorter this time,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni, Chavi Mehta, Jaspreet Singh and Samrhitha A in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia in 2024: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Tech stocks skyrocketed last year as excitement over budding industries like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing rallied investors. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index rose 67% throughout 2023, significantly improving from the year before when it plunged 40%.  And the market has shown no signs of slowing, making 2024 an excellent time to expand your position in tech.\n\nNvidia was one of the biggest winners last year as it snapped up a majority market share in AI chips. Its stock is up 224% year over year, making it an attractive option for investing in AI and tech in general. However, there are other stocks with similar secular tailwinds in tech that could offer more value than the chipmaker.\n\nSo forget Nvidia in 2024. Here are two tech stocks to buy instead.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) made headlines last week by surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap close to $2.9 trillion. The company has become a behemoth in tech, with growth catalysts across the industry.\n\nThe tech giant is home to some of the most widely recognized brands: Windows, Office, Xbox, LinkedIn, and Azure, which attract billions of users. These services grant Microsoft lucrative positions in markets such as operating systems, productivity software, digital advertising, cloud clouting, AI, and video games.\n\nThe growth of these products sent Microsoft's stock soaring 280% over the last five years, with annual revenue up 68%. Meanwhile, its free cash flow hit over $63 billion in 2023, giving it the funds to invest heavily in its research and development.\n\nSo, it's not surprising that Microsoft has sunk billions into AI over the last year. A heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI granted Microsoft a 49% stake in the start-up. OpenAI's tech and popular services from Office and Azure could prove a powerful combination, giving Microsoft almost endless ways to monetize its AI offerings. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThese charts show Microsoft's stock is also significantly cheaper than Nvidia's. The company has lower figures in three key valuation metrics: forward price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF), and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios.\n\nStory continues\n\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/FCF divides its market cap by free cash flow. Forward P/S uses a similar calculation, dividing its market cap by estimated revenue. For all three metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nThese are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In each metric, Microsoft is a far bigger bargain than Nvidia.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) was slightly overshadowed last year by cloud giants like Microsoft and Amazon. However, the company has spent the last year developing a highly anticipated AI model called Gemini that could give it an edge in the market.\n\nAlphabet is one of the most reliable investment options in tech, with a stock that has steadily risen 113% since 2019. Meanwhile, revenue and operating income have soared 75% and 108%.\n\nMuch of its success is owed to its dominance in the digital advertising market. The company holds a 25% market share in the industry thanks to the massive user base it has built up through YouTube, Google, Android, and Chrome. These platforms attract billions of users, presenting countless advertising opportunities.\n\nThe popularity of these services will likely prove a major asset when expanding in AI. With the help of Gemini, Alphabet will be able to create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, add new AI tools on Google Cloud, offer more efficient advertising, and better track viewing trends on YouTube.\n\nAlongside over $77 billion in free cash flow, it's hard to ignore the growth potential of Alphabet's business and stock. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nLike Microsoft, Alphabet's stock offers far more value than Nvidia. The tables above show Alphabet's forward P/E, P/FCF, and P/S ratios are substantially lower than the chipmaker, making its stock less of a risk.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise last year has made it an expensive option. However, Alphabet remains a bargain with significant potential in tech.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "By Anna Tong\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Sakana AI, a Tokyo-based artificial intelligence startup founded by two prominent former Google researchers, said on Tuesday it had raised $30 million in a seed financing round led by Lux Capital, with participation from Khosla Ventures.\n\nSakana AI seeks to put Tokyo on the map as an AI hub, similar to what OpenAI did for San Francisco and DeepMind did for London, said Lux Capital partner Grace Isford.\n\nThe company, which does not yet have any products in the market, is looking to make fundamental improvements to today's AI systems through having a large number of smaller models communicate and work together rather than creating one giant monolithic model, it told Reuters last year.\n\nIt will also work on developing AI models better suited for the Asian market because Asian character-based languages function very differently from Western languages, Lux Capital partner Brandon Reeves said.\n\n\"Asian languages are very under-explored because most large language models are developed for Western languages,\" he said.\n\nThe company's founders are former Google researchers David Ha and Llion Jones.\n\nJones is the fifth author on Google's 2017 research paper \"Attention Is All You Need\", which introduced the \"transformer\" deep learning architecture that went on to become the basis for viral chatbot ChatGPT and the current race to develop products powered by generative AI.\n\nHa was previously the head of research at Stability AI and a Google Brain researcher.\n\nAll of the authors on the \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper have left Google. Their new ventures have attracted millions of dollars in funding from venture investors, including Noam Shazeer, who is running AI chatbot startup Character.AI, and Aidan Gomez, who founded large language model startup Cohere.\n\nLux Capital is a venture capital firm that specializes in deep technology, investing in industries such as aerospace, AI and biology.

        "title": "If You'd Invest $350,000 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends",
        "content": "A group of technology giants dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" was responsible for a large proportion of the 26.3% gain in the S&P 500 last year. That's because their collective valuation of $12 trillion makes up 28% of the index, so they have a huge influence over the direction of the broader market.\n\nThese are the Magnificent Seven stocks, and how they performed in 2023: NVDA Total Return Price Chart\n\nThe Equal Weight S&P 500 index -- which assigns an identical weighting to all 500 stocks -- finished 2023 with a gain of just 11.5%. It highlights just how impactful the surging Magnificent Seven returns were on the actual S&P 500. If you didn't own that group of stocks last year, your portfolio probably lagged the market.\n\nBut it's not all about blockbuster gains, because some of the Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. I'm going to show you how much you could earn with a $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence, cloud computing, electric vehicles, and more\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies operate across every major segment of the technology sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the largest driver of value in 2023, which is why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the group higher. Its H100 and upcoming H200 data center chips are designed to process AI workloads, and demand continues to surge as more businesses seek to develop AI applications.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are some of the world's largest data center operators, and therefore some of Nvidia's biggest customers. They use those centralized data centers to deliver cloud services -- and the computing power necessary to develop AI -- to millions of businesses around the world. Plus, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet offer cloud customers a growing number of large language models (LLMs), which are the building blocks of many AI applications.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using AI to show more relevant content to each of its 3.1 billion monthly users. The company also created an LLM of its own called Llama, which is open source, so any developer can use it to build advanced AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) created its own LLM in-house, which it's using to develop an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT. It will pair nicely with the company's latest iPhone 15, because it's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads on-device. This will place AI at the fingertips of billions of people around the world.\n\nFinally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the world's leading electric vehicle company by sales up until the end of 2023, when it was edged out by China-based BYD. However, Tesla's future will likely be determined by the success of its AI-powered autonomous self-driving vehicle technology. It's yet to be publicly released, but it has the potential to transform the company's economics. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThree of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay dividends\n\nSome companies generate so much profit they can't possibly reinvest it all into their operations to fuel more growth, so they pay some of it to shareholders instead. Dividends are the most common form of distribution, and they usually come as quarterly cash payments.\n\nApple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that pay dividends. Each of them less than a 1% yield, which are the payouts investors can expect to receive annually, calculated based on the value of their holdings. MSFT Dividend Yield Chart\n\nYields often change. If a stock doubles, its yield will halve organically unless the company raises its dividend. It doesn't mean the payout shrinks in dollar terms, but it falls as a percentage of the value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers the highest yield, and while it seems small at face value, it translates to around $20 billion in dividend payments each year based on its current market capitalization of $2.8 trillion.\n\nIf you'd invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock) you would earn a dividend yield of 0.37% on $150,000, and no yield on the other $200,000. That translates to an effective yield of 0.18% on the $350,000, or an annual payment of $659.56.\n\nIt's a paltry sum given the yield investors can earn on cash in a savings account right now, but it's a nice bonus on top of the spectacular capital growth these stocks have delivered over the past year.\n\nDividends aren't the only form of distribution\n\nA dividend isn't the only way companies return money to shareholders. They can also execute stock buyback programs, where they purchase their own shares on the open market. Those shrink the number of available shares in circulation, which leads to a higher price per share.\n\nStock buybacks are preferable to dividends for many companies, because they give them the flexibility to distribute the money at a time of their choosing -- they aren't locked into paying out a specified sum each quarter.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven companies have active share repurchase programs, worth a combined $186.6 billion over the last 12 months. Tesla and Amazon are the two without active programs. AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nAre the Magnificent Seven stocks still a buy now?\n\nAs I touched on at the top, investors who didn't own the Magnificent Seven stocks in 2023 likely underperformed the S&P 500 index. The law of large numbers makes it somewhat counterintuitive to expect these enormous companies to continue delivering the best returns in the entire market, because it gets harder for them to grow their revenue and earnings each year.\n\nHowever, it so happens that the Magnificent Seven companies operate at the forefront of the fastest growing industries in the world.

        "title": "YouTube making money off new breed of climate denial, monitoring group says",
        "content": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - YouTube is making millions of dollars a year from advertising on channels that make false claims about climate change because content creators are using new tactics that evade the social media platform's policies to combat misinformation, according to a report published on Tuesday.\n\nThe Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) used artificial intelligence to review transcripts from 12,058 videos from the past six years on 96 of Alphabet Inc's YouTube channels. The channels promoted content that undermines the scientific consensus on climate change that human behavior is contributing to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns, the report said.\n\nCCDH, a nonprofit that monitors online hate speech, said its analysis found that climate denial content has shifted away from false claims that global warming is not happening or that it is not caused by greenhouse gases produced from burning fossil fuels. Videos espousing such claims are explicitly banned from generating ad revenue on YouTube, according to Google's policy.\n\nInstead, the report found that last year 70% of climate denial content on the channels analyzed focused on attacking climate solutions as unworkable, portraying global warming as harmless or beneficial, or casting climate science and the environmental movement as unreliable. That's up from 35% five years earlier.\n\n\"A new front has opened up in this battle,\" Imran Ahmed, chief executive of CCDH, said on a call with reporters. \"The people that we've been looking at, they've gone from saying climate change isn't happening to now saying, 'Hey, climate change is happening but there is no hope. There are no solutions.'\"\n\nYouTube is making up to $13.4 million a year from ads on the channels that the report analyzed, CCDH said. The group said the AI model was crafted to be able to distinguish between reasonable skepticism and false information.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a statement, YouTube did not comment directly on the report but defended its policies.\n\n\"Debate or discussions of climate change topics, including around public policy or research, is allowed,\" a YouTube spokesperson said. \"However, when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we stop showing ads on those videos.\"\n\nCCDH called on YouTube to update its policy on climate denial content and said the analysis could assist the environmental movement to combat false claims about global warming more broadly.

        "title": "The Once High-Flying Stock-Split Stock to Avoid Like the Plague in 2024",
        "content": "Investing on Wall Street has been akin to riding a roller coaster since this decade began. Over the past four years, the major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.\n\nWhen volatility rules the roost on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to pile into time-tested outperformers. While the FAANG stocks have certainly fit the bill for the past decade, it's companies enacting stock splits that have been investors' preference over the past couple of years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude, without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Stock splits can be used to make shares of a company more nominally affordable for everyday investors (a forward-stock split), or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (a reverse-stock split).\n\nInvestors have flocked to high-profile stock-split stocks for more than two years\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, nine high-flying companies have conducted forward-stock splits, including semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), internet search behemoth Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and e-commerce kingpin Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which effected respective splits of 4-for-1, 20-for-1, and 20-for-1.\n\nAlthough the act of splitting their respective shares is a very short-term catalyst driven by investor emotions, forward-stock splits more importantly act as a beacon for businesses that are out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nFor example, Nvidia has gone on to become the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution since conducting its split in July 2021. The company's A100 and H100 AI-inspired graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a greater than 90% share of GPUs in use by high-compute data centers this year. While Nvidia's stock would probably be soaring with or without its stock split in July 2021, its previous split has made shares more affordable for investors without access to fractional-share purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock splits have also served as a reminder of just how impressive Alphabet's and Amazon's respective moats are. Alphabet's Google tallied a nearly 92% share of global internet search in December, which is 88 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor. Google Cloud has also gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure services spending.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon brought in approximately 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022, per Insider Intelligence, and it's the leading provider of global cloud infrastructure services via Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS sports an annual sales run rate of $92 billion and is currently responsible for the lion's share of Amazon's operating income.\n\nLong story short, it's very easy to see why investors have flocked to high-profile stock-split stocks in recent years. Just keep in mind that not all stock-split stocks are worth investing in. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis ultra-popular stock-split stock is worth avoiding in 2024\n\nWhereas forward-stock splits are almost always conducted by top-notch companies, reverse-stock splits are, more often than not, a sign of trouble. Though there have been a few instances throughout history of reverse-stock splits working out nicely for long-term investors, such as tech-based travel company Booking Holdings, reverse splits are usually situations to avoid.\n\nFor once-high-flying marijuana stock Canopy Growth(NASDAQ: CGC), its recent split is all the more reason to keep your distance in 2024. Effective Dec. 20, 2023, the company completed a 1-for-10 reverse split. Had this split not taken place, Canopy's common stock would be trading for about $0.45 per share, which is more than 99% below its all-time high.\n\nAt one time, the Canadian pot industry appeared primed for success. When our neighbors to the north gave recreational weed the green light to be legally sold in October 2018, it was widely expected that vertically integrated licensed producers would thrive. In particular, Canopy Growth was expected to benefit from international exports and a domestic surge in demand for higher-margin cannabis derivatives (e.g., edibles, beverages, and vapes).\n\nUnfortunately, reality never came close to matching these expectations. Part of the blame does lie with Canadian regulators. Federal regulators were incredibly slow to approve cultivation licenses prior to October 2018, while provincial regulators in Ontario (Canada's largest province by population) initially relied on a lottery system to award dispensary licenses. This lottery system resulted in far too few retail locations opening in a key province.\n\nConsumer behavior didn't quite align with projections for Canadian cannabis companies, either. Cannabis users have gravitated toward value-based products and dried cannabis flower. In other words, margins for Canadian licensed producers are far below what was expected.\n\nBut let's not beat around the cannabis bush -- Canopy Growth deserves more than its fair share of the blame, too. Management grossly overestimated domestic and global production needs, which is one reason the company took a goodwill impairment charge of more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2023).\n\nFurthermore, during the early stages of the marijuana craze, Canopy Growth's stock-based compensation was exorbitantly high. Even after hiring David Klein in 2020 from Constellation Brands to tighten Canopy Growth's proverbial belt, the company still hasn't been able to back its way into the profit column. CGC Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nA history of poor acquisitions, coupled with grossly overexpanding production capacity without understanding consumer demand trends, has decimated the company's once-robust cash pile. Since closing a roughly $4 billion equity investment from Constellation Brands in November 2018, Canopy Growth's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments have shrunk to around $201 million, as of Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nAlthough Canopy Growth has raised some cash by issuing stock and conducting private placements, the company's auditors have included a going concern warning in its operating results. This means Canopy may not have the capital to cover its expected operating liabilities over the next 12 months.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for Canopy Growth is that there's no guarantee the U.S. federal government will change marijuana's scheduling anytime soon. President Joe Biden has signaled no willingness to legalize cannabis for recreational purposes, and multiple attempts to enact banking reform measures have been stymied in the U.S. Senate. Without the ability to enter the most lucrative cannabis market in the world, Canopy Growth stock likely has further to fall.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Canopy Growth right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Canopy Growth, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Canopy Growth wasn't one of them.

For example, almost 80% of the Company's advertising customers use an AI-enabled tool when they run their Google Search and YouTube campaign.\n\nAlthough the Company was criticized by the media for being “late” to the AI party when they rolled out a Gen-AI chatbot after Microsoft, Google has been creating scaled, context-aware AI functions for at least a decade, such as semantic search. While not necessarily a “large language model (LLM),” semantic search has become a mainstay in all-things search – predicting what users want to see or type before they type it. Consumers probably do not really care what kind of AI framework is being used behind the technology they are using, as long as it is useful to them – but these AI features are what have helped drive the rapid growth of Alphabet’s Google franchise…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

        "content": "Step aside, CFOs: New generative AI technology stands to supplant you as your CEO's best friend.\n\nThis in part reflects how the latest crop of powerful tech can unlock major impact to worker productivity and corporate financials, according to a new study of CEOs by consultancy PwC. The survey was released ahead of an AI-themed World Economic Forum kicking off on Tuesday in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nAbout 68% of US CEOs surveyed say that the next 12 months will see generative AI increasing the amount of work that employees can accomplish. That number is 64% globally, according to PwC. Roughly half of US CEOs expect the technology to help them become more productive in their own work.\n\nThe productivity boost should serve up a jolt to profits, CEOs contend.\n\nNearly 44% of the CEOs questioned say they see generative AI providing a net increase in profits in the next 12 months, versus just 3% anticipating a net decrease.\n\n\"Investors are also increasingly demanding executives pursue profitable growth, prompting many CEOs to turn not only to cost containment strategies, but also to GenAI,\" explained PwC. \"What’s alluring about GenAI is its dual ability to produce efficiency gains that hold down current expenses while simultaneously enabling company reinvention. This may mean that, when the macroeconomic headwinds abate, the stage is set for a potentially faster rate of growth on a lower cost basis.\"\n\nPwC adds that 2024 is shaping up to be the year of \"business model reinvention.\"\n\nPrior research from PwC puts a bow on the broader generative AI economic impact.\n\nAI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined.\n\nThe greatest economic gains from generative AI, says PwC, will be in China (an approximate 26% boost to GDP in 2030) and North America (a roughly 14.5% GDP jolt).\n\nTo be sure, investors have been positioning to capture any major upside in profit increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock indexes such as the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) continue to hover around record highs in 2024. Large-cap tech companies with outsized AI exposure such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon remain top picks amongst Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnd the share price of generative AI chip giant — and market darling — Nvidia has pushed to fresh records in 2024's early going.\n\nIn total, Wall Street currently expects S&P 500 profits to grow an impressive 11% in 2024 as new AI tools proliferate and inflation cools. Last year, S&P 500 profits grew about 3% as companies invested aggressively in the first tranche of generative AI and dealt with lingering inflation.\n\n\"The potential rewards from large and transformative impacts of GenAI still outweigh the rising investor expectations implied by solid CY23 stock performance,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance. \"On the balance, we are just getting started.\" Davos 2024\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday announced that it is launching a paid version of its generative AI-powered Copilot platform for consumers. The option, called Copilot Pro, will cost $20 per month per user, and give users access to a number of additional capabilities including access to the latest AI models and improved AI image generation via Image Creator from Designer.\n\nThe move comes as Microsoft looks to monetize its massive investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and continue to build on the momentum behind generative AI that kicked off in 2023.\n\nMicrosoft says Copilot Pro was developed for individual users who want to get priority access models, including GPT-4 Turbo, OpenAI’s latest offering, during peak usage hours for improved overall performance, as well as the ability to access Copilot across Microsoft’s Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote apps. Microsoft and its OEM partners are adding a new Copilot button to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards as the AI PC generation kicks off. (Image: Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nThe company says that Copilot Pro will provide a single experience on the PC, web, apps, as well as iOS and Android. Microsoft says Copilot Pro will also include access to its Image Creator and the option to customize your own Copilot GPTs for certain topics, whether that’s for working out, cooking, or any other interest you might have.\n\nIn addition to Copilot Pro, Microsoft has also announced that it’s dropping the minimum user limit for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Microsoft previously limited the offering to companies purchasing licenses for 300 seats or more. The change opens up the software to small and medium businesses.\n\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 brings Copilot to the company’s suite of productivity apps including Word, Excel, OneNote, Teams, and more. The enterprise edition of the software also allows companies to expand Copilot to their internal data, giving them the ability to search for and summarize their own content, not just data from the web. Access to the service is priced at $30 per user per month.\n\nMicrosoft is investing $10 billion over 10 years in OpenAI as a means of expanding its position in the enterprise productivity market and with the hope that it can simultaneously steal market share away from rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) in the search market via its AI-powered Bing chat and Edge browser.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine the average consumer subscribing to Copilot Pro, especially for $20 per month, but users who want to dive deeper into using generative AI or need quick access to high-powered AI models could find the service extremely useful.\n\nMore importantly, for Microsoft, the addition of Copilot Pro and opening up Copilot for Microsoft 365 to a larger number of business users will bring in more revenue for its AI efforts, providing Wall Street with further proof that the company is monetizing its investments. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nMicrosoft is moving quickly to push AI as one of its main product offerings. In addition to its Copilot platforms, the company recently debuted a Copilot key for Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The first new key for the Windows keyboard since the introduction of the Windows key itself, the Copilot key provides instant access to the Copilot app on users’ PCs.\n\nElevating Copilot to such a position shows how much Microsoft is set on showing that AI is an enormously important part of its future on a par with cloud computing. But Microsoft isn’t the only company working to seize the AI moment. Google is also selling access to its enterprise-grade productivity suite with its Duet AI platform, while Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM), and others look to gain more traction as well.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Jeffrey Dastin\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft on Monday said consumers and small businesses can buy subscriptions to access more capabilities in its artificial intelligence \"Copilot,\" as it moves to grow sales beyond large enterprises.\n\nAfter introducing a free AI Copilot for its Bing search engine last year, Microsoft will offer what it calls Copilot Pro to individuals for $20 a month.\n\nThe subscription will add a text-drafting, number-crunching AI assistant to Microsoft's widely used applications including Word and Excel, and it will give purchasers access to new tools and AI models such as GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nThe company also said it was removing a 300-person minimum requirement to buy the enterprise version of the software, making the security controls and Microsoft Teams upgrade that come with the $30 per-month per-user Copilot available to smaller businesses.\n\nMicrosoft now expects virtually all of its business customers to sign up, Corporate Vice President Jared Spataro said in an interview.\n\n\"I can't imagine a commercial organisation out there that will not buy at least a seat of Copilot to see what it's all about,\" he said.\n\nAlphabet's Google is competing with Microsoft in marketing AI for productivity and cloud software to business customers.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot Pro is also entering an increasingly competitive consumer market. ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, which Microsoft has funded, announced a $20-per-month subscription nearly a year ago called ChatGPT Plus that gives early access to new features and AI models.\n\nSpataro said Copilot Pro would stand apart because it is integrated into applications that \"people use every day\".\n\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",

        "content": "The U.S. economy is poised for a potential fiscal boost with a proposed $70 billion tax deal, currently under negotiation in Congress. If approved, the deal includes renewing expired business tax breaks and increasing the child tax credit, but it faces challenges in a divided Congress. While the extra cash could stimulate consumer spending, concerns about potential inflationary pressures complicate the Federal Reserve’s ability to lower interest rates. This positivity means that innovation will continue to rage on in 2024, and as a result, you should buy these three quantum computing stocks.\n\nHoneywell International Inc (HON) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

Momentum Stocks.\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON) is an American conglomerate corporation with operations in technologies, aerospace, building automation, and performance materials. It is valued at an impressive $201.10.\n\nFinancially, HON is thriving demonstrated by its EBIT Margin of 20.71% which is 111.08% more than the sector median. Cash From Operations is also a colossal 1,513.77% more than the sector median and Cash Per Share is 459.02% more. Working Capital Growth (YoY) is 844.66% more than the sector average and PEG GAAP is 846.67%. These financials truly exhibit how well-rounded HON is.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs of January 12, Honeywell and NXP have signed a deal to build next-gen automation with AI, and HON is also furthering its quantum tech solutions. NXP’s superior tools will allow the AI to adapt, observe, and learn in real-time and is expected to be a major step in the AI breakthrough. And Honeywell’s quantum tech will help propel this chip technology to the next level. This new deal indicates that Honeywell is on the cutting edge. As it continues experimenting with AI its financials will only rise more.\n\nDue to this partnership deal and financials, I give Honeywell a “Buy” rating, and strongly recommend it to anyone trying to diversify their portfolio with a quantum computing stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Incorporated (GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an American multinational tech company that is the parent company of Google, Nest, YouTube, Waze, and Fitbit to name a few.\n\nGOOGL’s stock is up 1.15% YTD at $142.54 and is covered by 50 analysts. These analysts are predicting a 12-month price forecast with a median-high price of $155.50-$180.00 representing increases of nearly 9.1% and 26.3% respectively.\n\nFrom 2022-2023, Alphabet’s market cap grew by 53.43% from $1.145 trillion to $1.756 trillion. Revenue also grew by 5.05% and earnings by 9.9%. The P/S ratio also grew by 37.75% in the same time frame. EBITDA Growth was 196.44% more than the sector median and EPS FWD Long Term Growth (3-5Y CAGR) was 88.85% more.\n\nIn the past year, GOOGL has expanded its Google Cloud to locations like Greece, Mexico, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia which has given its stock a massive boost. As it continues to expand, a similar trend should follow. In addition, Alphabet recently released a foldable phone, causing shockwaves throughout the industry. Product innovation, especially, within quantum computing, will only propel them forward and allow them to continue pioneering in the tech world.\n\nDue to GOOGL’s expansion, innovation, and rising financials, I give it a “Buy” rating and expect it to rise shortly.\n\nSplunk Inc (SPLK) Splunk Stock Will Keep Powering Higher Despite Being Overvalued\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSplunk Inc (NASDAQ:SPLK) is an American software company, that produces an operating system to analyze, search, and monitor data. It is valued at $152.72 up 71.85% from last year.\n\nFinancially, Splunk has shown improvement in most if not all metrics.

Gross Profit Margin grew to 79.07% which was 60.04% than the sector median, and Levered FCF Margin was 191.70% more than the sector average. EV / EBIT was also 833.86% more than the sector median, all indicating the well-roundedness of SPLK financials.\n\nSpunk’s new edge processor is expected to be revolutionary for the industry. RawHEC Support allows data to be received in a simpler format thus making it easier for information to be transferred to Splunk from 3rd party systems. In addition, the edge processor allows Lookups, allowing details to be added to data before it is officially saved.\n\nAs Splunk continues innovating, its strong financials will become even stronger. With its positive outlook, I give it a “Buy” rating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) isn't just another tech buzzword; it's a groundbreaking force, reshaping our lives and businesses. In a memorable blog post from the spring of 2023, Microsoft founder Bill Gates compared AI's game-changing powers to the introduction of the internet and the mobile phone:\n\nIt will change the way people work, learn, travel, get healthcare, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.\n\nAnd Gates is not a lone voice in the wilderness. For instance, futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil respectfully dissented when asked to sign an open letter calling for a pause in high-powered AI research. \"There are tremendous benefits to advancing AI in critical fields such as medicine and health, education, pursuit of renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels, and scores of other fields,\" Kurzweil wrote.\n\nThe renowned scientist, serving as Alphabet's director of engineering since 2012, saw this revolution coming decades ago. Kurzweil used to believe that affordable household-level computers would eclipse human brain power around the year 2020. That deadline has moved to 2045 or thereabouts, but \"humanity 2.0\" is still coming. You can't stop progress -- you can only hope to contain it.\n\nThe world is changing before our eyes, and the next generation of humans will co-exist with AI-powered computers in a whole new way. These sea changes are rare and extremely powerful. Experts like Gates and Kurzweil argue that AI is the next truly game-changing technology.\n\nSo it's high time to prepare for what's next. For investors like you and me, that means grabbing a diversified basket of promising AI stocks. Here's why SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) and IBM(NYSE: IBM) would be helpful components of that basket.\n\nSoundHound: Making the leap from tunes to tech\n\nYou may know SoundHound for its music identification app. You know the drill -- play a few seconds of any song into your smartphone's microphone, give SoundHound another couple of seconds to find sonic patterns in that sample, and get data such as the song title, artist, composer, and lyrics.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivals like Shazam (now a part of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)) and Deezer work by \"fingerprinting\" the audio and matching the result to a database of known signatures. SoundHound's AI-based system digs deeper into the characteristics of the track before matching a more sophisticated range of patterns. For example, SoundHound can isolate the melody line, allowing you to find tunes by singing or humming into your phone -- in the wrong key, at an unexpected tempo, or in a noisy environment. Shazam's simpler approach can't do that.\n\nBut song-ID services are not terribly lucrative, so SoundHound has expanded its focus around the core expertise of AI-powered audio analysis. So SoundHound built a powerful audio recognition engine known as Houndify around its years of song-focused research and oodles of data from those 10-second samples. The company quickly found clients in the automotive industry and consumer electronics. More recently, SoundHound launched voice-driven tools for restaurant management.\n\nNow, SoundHound is a direct bet on AI technology delivering superior results to more traditional consumer-facing systems. You'll run across automated Houndify interactions at drive-through windows and in call center phone menus. If you've gotten used to telling your car what radio station to play or what temperature you want in the air conditioning, you may very well use SoundHound's Houndify every day without knowing it.\n\nAnd this little company is going places. SoundHound's trailing revenues stood at $19.6 million in the summer of 2022, just after its initial public offering (IPO). It has nearly doubled since then to $38.2 million. The company is unprofitable so far but getting closer to the breakeven point in every quarter. Furthermore, the stock isn't exactly setting the world on fire. SoundHound's shares have traded sideways since November 2022, despite the AI boom of 2023.\n\nI expect big things from SoundHound AI as it continues to expand into new target markets while refining its pricing and profits. In a worst-case scenario, the company could be a buyout target for some tech giant without a credible audio analysis platform. But ideally, this undervalued growth stock should have room to run higher for many years as a stand-alone business.\n\nIBM: Not your grandpa's old-school tech giant anymore\n\nBig Blue is a long-standing leader in the tech industry, with a trend-setting presence in the AI segment through its Watson platform. This AI system, famous for winning \"Jeopardy!\" and beating the world champion of chess in 1999, has evolved into a powerful tool for business analytics and cloud services. IBM is happy to leave consumer-grade AI tools to other companies, focusing on business-grade services instead.\n\nIBM's shift to hybrid cloud computing and AI-focused strategies under CEOs Ginni Rometty and Arvind Krishna signals a commitment to remaining relevant in the rapidly advancing tech landscape.\n\nThe company's recent financials show a steady trajectory, with a renewed focus on high-margin cloud and AI services. Sales are up by 7% over the last two years while free cash flows rose 15% and diluted earnings per share jumped 50% higher. These positive trends include an inflation-driven dip in 2022: IBM Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThis pivot positions IBM as a stable and promising investment in the AI field, backed by a legacy of innovation and a clear vision for the future. And investors seem to have forgotten about IBM's robust AI chops amid the recent boom. Big Blue's stock trades at a bargain-bin valuation of 12.5 times free cash flows and 22 times earnings, having gained a below-par 14% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nIf you're looking for a powerful AI stock without the lofty trillion-dollar price tags of market darlings like Nvidia or Microsoft, IBM strikes me as a top idea today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke about the company's vision for AI at Chatham House, in London, on Monday. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will displace jobs but remains optimistic about the impact even as the IMF warned that almost 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of AI.\n\nNadella told an audience at London’s Chatham House on Monday that every big technological revolution displaces jobs but that the technology will help develop new career skills.\n\n“There will be jobs, the question is the shape of these jobs. If anything, these tools can be very helpful with getting us the skills for what is the new set of tasks,” he said.\n\n“Everyone can become an expert in anything because they have an AI assistant,” he added.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that AI is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs. The organisation said the impact will be greater for advanced economies, with around 60% of roles affected.\n\nRead more: LIVE: FTSE 100 hovers with AI in the spotlight as global leaders head to Davos\n\nAbout half of those workers will benefit from the integration of AI, which could boost productivity, but the remainder could see lower salaries, reduced hiring and, “in the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear”, according to the IMF.\n\n“In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said.\n\nNadella has made a push for Microsoft to assume a global leadership role in AI. The company has a significant stake in leading AI startup ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, and reportedly invested up to $13bn in the startup. This alliance has been considered one of the tech industry’s most lucrative tie-ups.\n\nMicrosoft pushed for OpenAi’s chief executive Sam Altman to be reinstated after a messy corporate dispute in November.\n\nNadella and Altman are both scheduled to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI has allowed it to roll out Copilot, an AI enabled software assistant.\n\nGoing even further, a new Copilot key will ship on a variety of new PCs and laptops from Microsoft’s partners, providing quick access to Copilot straight from a keyboard button press.\n\nThe Copilot key is the first big change to the Windows PC keyboard layout in nearly three decades.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Crest Nicholson, PageGroup, Baidu and United Airlines\n\nThe hype around AI has allowed Microsoft to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the most valuable company in the world.\n\nOn Friday, Microsoft’s market capitalisation stood at $2.887tn, a new record high for the company, and above Apple’s market cap of $2.875tn.\n\nThe last time the software giant earned the title of most valuable company in the world was back in 2021.\n\nRead more: Microsoft topples Apple to become global market cap leader\n\nShares in Microsoft climbed over 50% in 2023 and analysts expect AI to take it even higher this year.\n\nOther AI-focused tech players such as Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet ( GOOG), also witnessed a big jump in their market cap in the past year, Reuters reported.\n\nAt Chatham House, Nadella also said that he is \"sanguine\" about the risk AI poses to political elections.\n\n“Election interference existed before AI,” the Microsoft CEO said, adding that the world can learn from these past election cycles.\n\nWatch: Apple & Microsoft: The future of AI in consumer tech<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AAPL</a>) and Microsoft (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">MSFT</a>) at CES 2024 (Consumer Electronics Show) as, for a brief moment, Microsoft took over <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-briefly-overtakes-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-before-apple-takes-back-crown-165431534.html\\\">as the most valuable company</a> for the first time since 2021.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "What a difference a year makes. After a 2022 when the U.S. suffered through decades-high inflation and the worst stock market performance since 2008, Wall Street staged a heady rebound last year. On the heels of its 35% decline in 2022, the Nasdaq Composite found its footing and gained 43% in 2023.\n\nStudents of economic history will know that the rally is likely to continue in 2024. Going back as far as 1972 -- the first full year that the tech-focused index existed -- in every year following a bear market rebound, the Nasdaq has returned 19%, on average. That pattern suggests that the current rally should still have legs. As in life, there are no guarantees in investing, but stock aficionados would do well to pay attention to the lessons of history.\n\nFurthermore, there's an argument that last year's rally was sparked by the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). It's still early days for generative AI, and companies are scrambling to determine how best to deploy these ground-breaking algorithms. One thing's for sure: Two companies with long histories of integrating AI into their operations are well-situated to profit. Let's look at both. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI stock No. 1: Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the most recognizable companies in the world, with business interests that stretch across a broad cross-section of both the consumer and commercial markets. A large contributor to Amazon's success has been the company's integration of AI into two business areas where it's the industry leader and a third where it's a major contender. The combination of its businesses in e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital advertising gives Amazon reach that's hard to rival.\n\nAmazon made a name for itself in digital retail, and it still dominates in that space. While the numbers for 2023 are still being compiled, Amazon accounted for roughly 38% of all online sales in the U.S. in 2022, more than the next 14 competitors combined, according to data specialist Statista. Improving economic conditions will likely drive Amazon's business higher over the coming year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company's rivals have chipped away at its supremacy in recent years, Amazon's long history of implementing AI across its operations has given it a consistent edge. And the company isn't taking its foot off the gas. It's deploying generative AI to improve the relevance of its product recommendations, surface more content that suits the tastes of its Prime Video viewers, ensure more accurate product reviews, and even help third-party sellers create more effective merchandise descriptions.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was the first modern cloud infrastructure provider, a market the company still leads today, with a roughly 31% worldwide market share, according to analytics firm Canalys. These users are the principal audience and target market for Amazon's AI offerings.\n\nThe company is also becoming a force to be reckoned with in digital advertising. In the third quarter, its ad revenue grew 26% year over year, outpacing the growth of industry leaders Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms, which grew 9% and 24%, respectively.\n\nAmazon's digital advertising ambitions will get a significant boost later this month as the company begins showing \"limited advertising\" on Prime Video. While viewers will have the option to pay $3 per month to opt out, Amazon will make more money either way. The company will use its AI prowess to ensure its digital ads reach their target markets.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of Amazon's recent AI expansion will undoubtedly be the company's cloud segment. The recently introduced Amazon Bedrock provides a host of AI models for AWS customers. The platform will also help cloud users create business-centric generative AI applications that will integrate each company's proprietary user data, improving the usefulness of the apps.\n\nThough the company has multiple growth drivers, the stock remains inexpensive. It's currently trading for 2 times forward sales, a significant discount to its five-year average multiple of 3.4. This provides astute investors the chance to buy shares on the cheap, before the current rally carries Amazon higher.\n\nAI stock No. 2: Alphabet\n\nAs is the case with Amazon, there are plenty of reasons to buy Alphabet stock, starting with the company's industry-leading position in two markets and strong position in a third.\n\nWhen it comes to internet search, Google is without equal. It controls 92% of the market, according to web analytics company StatCounter. Google was using AI to improve the accuracy of its search algorithms long before it was fashionable, giving the company a seemingly insurmountable lead that it continues to hold. Alphabet recently announced plans to further cement that lead by imbuing its search engine with generative AI functionality.\n\nAlphabet's search dominance fuels the company's digital advertising, and it remains the industry leader. Alphabet was responsible for 30% of digital advertising worldwide in 2022, according to data compiled by online trade publication Digiday, and the company is expected to maintain that lead when the books are closed on 2023.\n\nGoogle continues to empower advertisers, developing a suite of generative AI-powered improvements that make it easier to customize the text and images used in ads. This, in turn, leads to more profitable ad campaigns. The ongoing rebound in ad spending will likely fuel further gains for Alphabet in the coming year.\n\nFinally, Google Cloud is one of the \"big three\" cloud infrastructure providers, and was the fastest growing among its rivals in six of the past seven quarters. This also provides the company with a captive audience and pre-screened target market for its AI offerings.\n\nYet for all this growth potential, Alphabet remains historically cheap, selling for just 21 times earnings, well below the price-to-earnings ratio of 26 for the S&P 500. In view of its multiple growth areas, investors should get in on this discount while it lasts.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +7.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 7.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.62 per share, indicating a change of +54.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +27.9%. This estimate has changed +1.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 indicates a change of +15.6% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.8%. The $254.71 billion and $283.34 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.9% and +11.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $64.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $1.55 for the same period compares with $1.06 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.45%. The EPS surprise was +6.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alphabet surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Sizzling Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "In the dynamic world of stock investing, where the thrill of momentum meets the stability of long-term strategies, there's always a sweet spot for savvy investors. In the spirit of The Fool's market-beating Rule Breakers service, I love to identify underappreciated growth stocks with the resilience of solid management and innovative business strategies.\n\nOn the hunt for top dogs and first-movers in burgeoning industries, I look for sustainable business advantages such as booming market momentum, patent fortresses, visionary leadership, or the missteps of competitors.\n\nThis approach often aligns with the principles of momentum trading, a strategy that capitalizes on directional trends in stock prices. Momentum traders aim to \"buy high and sell even higher\" -- a path lined with both rewards and risks. The volatility and timing of momentum trades can be challenging, requiring a nuanced understanding of market trends and investor behavior. It's also a highly rewarding strategy when you get it right and a couple of big winners can make up for several underperforming picks.\n\nNow, let's move on to some specific stocks. Today, applying these principles led me to Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) and Atlassian(NASDAQ: TEAM). This thrilling duo of stocks isn't just on the rise; they're fundamentally geared for continued success. So let's check out why I see them as sizzling-hot opportunities in today's stock market.\n\nShopify: Build a world-class shopping platform and the rest will follow\n\nE-commerce platform expert Shopify is on a roll. The stock has gained 53% in the last three months and a staggering 123% over the last year and its most important financial metrics look like this: SHOP Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nBy making it easy to build and maintain an online shopping experience, Shopify reported double-digit revenue growth even in the economically stunted environment of 2022. The company generated $549 million of free cash flows in the last four quarters, up from a $186 million cash burn in fiscal year 2022. Its e-commerce platform is rising above the small-business focus that took it this far, signing enterprise-scale clients such as Unilever and Kraft Heinz in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd these are still early days in Shopify's growth story. The company has a modest 10% market share in the U.S. e-commerce trade and online shopping represents just 15% of all retail activity in North America -- and even less in regions like Asia-Pacific and Latin America.\n\nMost of all, I see an excellent management style at work here. Here are the three pillars of Shopify's business culture:\n\nBuild the best product in the world and the team and culture to support it Make money so we can do more of #1 Never reverse #1 and #2\n\nThis philosophy carries echoes of many powerful ideas. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) swears by \"10 things we know to be true,\" including \"focus on the user and all else will follow\" and \"great just isn't good enough.\"\n\nQuality comes first and the business results will naturally follow. \"If you build it, they will come,\" may be a silly movie tag line but the line also holds true in the business world. That attitude turned Alphabet into one of the world's most successful companies with a $1.8 trillion market cap. Shopify sure could have picked worse role models.\n\nSo I love Shopify's high-level business doctrine, which shows through in the company's terrific financial results. This stock should continue to rise -- not constantly, but the long-term trend is clear -- for many years to come. And you can actually still call it \"undervalued\" if you insist; Shopify's stock price has soared recently but remains more than 50% below the all-time highs of November 2021.\n\nShopify is indeed a sizzling growth stock. I don't own it yet but I'm sorely tempted to start a position before it skyrockets back to yesteryear's record prices and beyond.\n\nAtlassian: Another lighthearted innovator with serious business plans\n\nMany of the things I said about Shopify also ring true for Australia-based collaboration software specialist Atlassian.\n\nThe stock trades roughly 50% below the highs seen just before the global inflation crisis kicked off in 2021. At the same time, Atlassian's shares have gained 27% in one quarter and 67% over the last year. Atlassian's 5 core values are all about a fun and healthy work-life balance, not so much about money. And management slid some lighthearted fun into the guidelines themselves. As a great example of \"be the change you seek,\" Atlassian's team members \"don't #@!% the customer.\" Elsewhere, management talks about \"building a 100+ year company.\" The wording may be different, but I see a Shopify-like and Alphabet-inspired spirit in these documents. And the business is going places. My daily work includes heavy doses of its Jira, Trello, and Confluence tools. The company serves more than 265,000 customers, driving a 29% year-over-year jump in third-quarter revenues while more than doubling its free cash flows.\n\nMoreover, Atlassian likes to make its products do the talking, leaving most of its marketing in the hands of positive word-of-mouth reviews. And now I'm back to the good old Google philosophy again -- build a great collaboration platform and the financial results will follow. You don't even have to promote it if the darn thing is good enough.\n\nJudging by Atlassian's stellar results, and plethora of industry awards, its tools are more than \"good enough.\" And that's why the stock also looks tempting today, even after a 67% rebound in the last 52 weeks. Like Shopify, this company is going places and its stock is a sizzling-hot rocket with miles to go before it sleeps.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Shopify wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "12 Countries with Best Intelligence Agencies",
        "content": "In this article, we look at 12 countries with the best intelligence agencies. You can skip our detailed analysis on technologies that support intelligence agencies and head over directly to the 5 Countries with Best Intelligence Agencies.\n\nIntelligence agencies play a crucial role in this ever-evolving global security landscape to safeguard their nation’s interest. These agencies collect, analyze and disseminate information that is vital to national security, and have equipped themselves with highly effective technologies and tools to tackle the complex threats countries face in the modern-age.\n\nThe Space Based-Infrared System, or SBIRS, provides the United States capabilities in missile defense and warnings. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, both Japan and South Korea have been growing increasingly uneasy about North Korea’s intense missile programs over the last few years. Analysts believe the United States can expand the scope of intelligence sharing with its northeast Asian allies through real-time data from SBIRS about Pyongyang’s missile activities.\n\nIn August 2022, the sixth and final missile warning satellite, GEO-6, was launched by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as part of the SBIRS program. The GEO-6 is built on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s modernized LM 2100 Combat Bus, which offers greater resilience, improved propulsion and spacecraft power. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) has also in the past developed several spy planes, such as U-2 and A-12, for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that were capable of avoiding rival air defense systems.\n\nOn the other hand, cyberspace security has also widely begun to be considered as the fifth dimension of modern warfare. Former President Donald Trump in 2018 introduced the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to improve the US government’s protection against cyber attacks from private and rival-state hackers. As per the Department of Homeland Security, $3.06 billion have been allocated in funding to CISA for FY2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2021, CISA launched the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative with the aim ‘to unify cyber defenders from organizations worldwide’. Several tech giants are part of this program, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), among others, who already have a history of cooperating with American agencies on national security.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s collaboration with security agencies is not new. According to a 2013 report in The Guardian, the company granted the NSA access to encrypted messages, whereas Skype, a division of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), allowed audio and video conversations to be collected through Prism.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google in 2003 entered into a $2.1 million contract with the NSA to develop a customized search solution for them that could scan and recognize documents in as many as 24 languages. Google then went into a search contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to customize the CIA's internal Google search.\n\nIn 2008, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) partnered to jointly develop a visual intelligence system for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) to mark out Shia and Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad during the war in Iraq. In 2010, Google signed a $27 million contract with the NGA to provide it with geospatial visualization services, according to The Guardian. 12 Countries with Best Intelligence Agencies\n\nMyImages - Micha/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have ranked countries with the best intelligence agencies using consensus methodology. Rankings of countries with high intelligence capabilities were considered on four sources: Foreign Policy, VOX News, Lowy Institute Asia Power Index 2023, and Yahoo News. We factored in the number of times each country was mentioned on these lists for its intelligence capabilities. If a country ranked on all four of these websites, it received a score of four.\n\nSince there often were two or more countries that had the same score, we also weighed in cybersecurity capabilities of countries and the number of military satellites they had to help in outranking one over the other. Data for these two metrics were sourced from our articles, 12 Most Advanced Countries in Cybersecurity and 15 Countries with the Highest Number of Military Satellites in Orbit. Countries are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet’s now head over to the list of countries with the best intelligence agencies.\n\nTop 12 countries with the best intelligence capabilities:\n\n12. South Korea\n\nScore: 1.48\n\nThe National Intelligence Service (NIS) is the premiere intelligence agency in South Korea. Founded in 1961, it plays a vital role in national and regional security, with a key focus on counter-terrorism, as well as cybersecurity threats emanating from North Korea. The country boasts a strong defense network due to its extensive ties with the United States. According to the Lowy Institute, it ranks sixth in terms of intelligence capabilities in Asia. In 2016, however, the South Korean government decided to curb the powers of the NIS when it came to investigating suspects with ties to North Korea, and transferred that duty onto the national police.\n\n11. Japan\n\nScore: 1.49\n\nJapan is considered among countries having the best intelligence capabilities. There are five core intelligence agencies in Japan, with the Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA) being the most elite agency, equivalent to the FBI and CIA. The PSIA provides critical information related to foreign and domestic territories and activities to the government in Tokyo that is essential for Japan’s national security. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Al Qaeda declared Japan as a potential target to launch its attacks on. The country, with the help of institutions such as the PSIA and Self Defense Forces (SDF) took proactive measures to curb the threat of terrorism through improved immigration controls, security measures, and intelligence gathering.\n\n10. Germany\n\nScore: 1.78\n\nBundesnachrichtendienst, or BND, and also known as the Federal Intelligence Service, is the primary intelligence agency of Germany that has expertise on foreign intelligence and electronic surveillance of international communication, which is pivotal to regional security in Europe. According to a report, Germany in 2021 changed its legal framework for foreign intelligence gatherings, which expanded the country’s SIGINT powers and allowed BND to hack foreign internet service providers and collect foreign metadata in bulk. BND’s network of over 4,000 spies is scattered all over the world.\n\n9. France\n\nScore: 2.05\n\nNext up is France, whose secret service, Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), is one of the best intelligence agencies in the world, with a network of more than 5,000 agents across the globe who collect intelligence and inform the French government. According to a report, the DGSE has foiled more than 15 terrorist attacks in France since 2001. Moreover, France has 10 military satellites, which it uses for intelligence gathering. This is the highest number of military satellites in orbit for any European country. When it comes to cybersecurity, France received a score of 15 out of 50 on Belfer Center's National Cybersecurity Index 2022.\n\n8. Australia\n\nScore: 2.69\n\nAustralia is one of the countries with the best intelligence agencies, especially the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), that is tasked to oversee developments across the world. The agency works extensively in all areas that defend Australia’s political and economic interests. ASIS’s existence remained a secret even from the Australian government for more than two decades; founded in 1952, it was first referred to in the Parliament in 1975 and not publicly recognized till 1977. The ASIS received a score of 72.1 out of 100 on intelligence capabilities from the Lowy Institute and is also recognized by Vox News as one of the finest spy agencies in the world.\n\n7. United Kingdom\n\nScore: 3.80\n\nMI6 is among the best intelligence agencies in the world. Founded in July 1909, it was not until 1994 when its identity was first made public. According to a report in Yahoo, the MI6 has spent about $2.6 billion on counter-terrorism operations alone in recent decades. It is also known to collect intelligence for the UK government on areas such as nuclear weapons and drug trafficking. The agency played a key role for the UK in both world-wars and then later, the cold war.\n\n6. Pakistan\n\nScore: 4.16\n\nPakistan’s intelligence gathering capabilities are recognized world-over, and its premier spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, was listed among the best intelligence agencies in the world by Foreign Policy, VOX News, Lowy Institute, and Yahoo – all the four sources considered for this article. Despite being underfunded, the ISI remains resourceful with a wide network of agents inside and outside Pakistan. One of the most notable achievements of the ISI was thwarting the Soviet Union’s expansion in Afghanistan and beyond. According to a report in Yahoo, the ISI is rumored to fund key policymakers in the West to lobby for Pakistan over matters related to diplomacy and geopolitics.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with Best Intelligence Agencies.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Countries With Highest Military Spending In The World 13 Countries With The Most Overseas Military Bases 8 Countries Ruled by Military Dictatorship in 2023\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Countries with Best Intelligence Agencies is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

The company also owns YouTube, which it purchased in 2006, and is now the second most popular website globally, followed by Google Search. While there are valid concerns about disruption from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM), and competition for YouTube, we believe the economic moats for both businesses remain intact. We also think the Google ecosystem, which benefits from strong network effects, will drive advertising revenue at a high single-digit rate for at least the next five years. Alphabet also owns one of the three major cloud companies (Google Cloud Platform) and has a number of private businesses that, while not profitable today, have the potential to become more valuable to shareholders over time. The company’s balance sheet is strong, with approximately $106 billion of net cash ($8.48/share), and free cash flow conversion remains excellent.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

        "content": "The AI revolution may exert pressure on governments to enact new social safety nets to protect people who lose their jobs but are unable to upskill themselves, warns the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\"If we don't have thoughtful distribution of benefits [of AI] and inequality grows dramatically, that can break the social fabric in a way that is going to be very unhealthy for the world,\" IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva tells Yahoo Finance Live. \"Social safety nets in a world of artificial intelligence are paramount.\"\n\nGeorgieva's comments come amid the release of an extensive IMF study on the global economic impact of AI's proliferation on Sunday. The findings coincide with the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where AI will be a hot topic amongst high-profile tech attendees such as Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, OpenAI's Sam Altman, and Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nThose social safety nets may need a hefty amount of funds, if the IMF's findings are any indication.\n\nAbout 40% of global employment is exposed to AI, according to the IMF. In advanced economies, roughly 60% of jobs are exposed to AI due to the prevalence of \"cognitive task\" oriented jobs. Overall exposure is 40% in emerging markets and 26% in low-income countries, says the IMF.\n\nAlthough many emerging markets and developing economies may experience less immediate AI-related disruption, the IMF reasons they are also ready to capitalize on AI's advantages. This could \"exacerbate\" the \"digital divide\" and \"cross-country income disparity,\" the study concludes.\n\nGeorgieva thinks the elderly could see an outsized impact from AI's widespread adoption and be in need of a social safety net.\n\n\"You have to be able to support those that fall off a cliff because their jobs are wiped out. We also look at who are most adaptable. Obviously the younger generation, in some areas, women more adaptable, but in others less. And the older generation may need more support to catch up in this new world,\" Georgieva adds.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe IMF isn't a singular voice on possible economic aftershocks from AI.\n\nIn research of its own in 2023, Goldman Sachs economists found that advances in AI could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs globally to automation. In other words, job loss.\n\nGoldman's economists projected that roughly two-thirds of US occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI.\n\nLook no further than the news industry as a prime example of what the IMF and Goldman are discussing.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are well down the path of ingesting news and information and spewing it out to the global masses, lessening the need to visit a website. Media organizations, meantime, have moved to automate some functions of newsrooms to increase content quantity and slash costs.\n\nNews Corporation CEO Robert Thomson (NWSA) told Yahoo Finance Live in late 2023 that AI will be \"epochal\" for news.\n\nThomson went onto warn that the industry could face a \"tsunami potentially of job losses\" due to the new tech.\n\n\"These are not just jobs lost, it's insights lost. So it's important that all media companies understand the impact, but also, it's incumbent on the big AI players to understand their impact,\" Thomson added.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy That Could Be Massive Long-Term Winners",
        "content": "You've probably heard the phrase \"think long term\" more times than you can count. But doing is often a lot harder than hearing it. Investors can easily be distracted by temporary issues when a stock is floundering.\n\nHowever, you can also lose sight of the big picture when a stock is performing well. Not every stock has what it takes to succeed for years and even decades, but some do. Here are three growth stocks to buy that could be massive long-term winners.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nEarly last year, some investors were wringing their hands over Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). They thought the tech giant had missed the boat on generative AI. OpenAI, in their minds, was eating Alphabet's lunch. Fast-forward to today, and Alphabet stock has soared more than 60% over the last 12 months.\n\nIn retrospect, it's clear that Alphabet didn't miss the boat on generative AI at all. The company plans to soon launch Gemini Ultra, an AI model that outperforms the best AI systems currently available on 30 of 32 widely used benchmarks.\n\nAI should provide a huge long-term tailwind for Alphabet's Google Cloud business. That will especially be the case if the company stays at the forefront of AI tool development. I don't think that will be too much of a stretch, considering the expertise in Alphabet's Google Deepmind unit and the company's overall research and development (R&D) budget of close to $40 billion.\n\nAlphabet has another major AI-related opportunity with its Waymo self-driving car technology business. It's a leader in developing quantum computers. The company is even researching how to extend the human life span. Maybe the stock won't be a massive winner over the next 20 years, but I wouldn't bet against it.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nThink back to mid-2022 when the stock market had fallen quite a bit. Growth stocks had been hit especially hard. MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) was one of them, with its shares plunging nearly 70% below its peak set in early 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose were only temporary headwinds, though. Over the last 12 months, MercadoLibre stock has soared close to 80%.\n\nMercadoLibre isn't a household name in the U.S. but is well-known in Latin America. It operates the largest e-commerce platform in the region, with more than 50 million unique buyers.\n\nThere's still plenty of room to grow in the Latin American e-commerce market. MercadoLibre's top two e-commerce markets, Brazil and Mexico, are projected to expand by compound annual growth rates of 17% and 33%, respectively, through 2026. The company should have big opportunities in other Latin American countries, as well.\n\nMercadoLibre has also leveraged its e-commerce platform to expand into adjacent markets and operates a large logistics business. Fintech is another key growth driver, with the company's MercadoPago digital payments products and services.\n\n3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) has been one of the rare stocks in recent years that perform well, regardless of what the overall market does. Its shares jumped more than 31% in 2022 when the major market indexes sank. The biotech stock was a big winner last year with the momentum carrying over into 2024.\n\nI predict that Vertex will be even more successful in the future than it's been in the past. My main reason for this optimistic view is that the company is expanding into lucrative markets outside of cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\nVertex recently won U.S. approval for Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease. It awaits a second approval decision for the gene-editing therapy in treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The big biotech expects to soon report results from late-stage studies of VX-548, a non-opioid drug targeting acute pain.\n\nPeering a little farther down the road, Vertex has a good shot at launching the first therapy to treat the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease. This disease affects more patients than CF. The company is also evaluating cell therapies in early-stage clinical studies that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "The 2 Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms, and Tesla. They earned that moniker because of their incredible valuations and far-reaching impact on different areas of the technology sector, and they have delivered incredible returns over the last year.\n\nCrucially, each of these companies also has big advantages in artificial intelligence (AI) and massive opportunities to benefit from it over the long term. But while each of the Magnificent Seven should benefit from some AI-related performance catalysts, some will necessarily perform better than others.\n\nIf you're looking for top ways to benefit from the AI revolution, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors identified Nvidia and Alphabet as the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2024 and beyond.\n\nIncredible momentum and massive opportunities\n\nKeith Noonan (Nvidia): With gains of roughly 238% over the last year, Nvidia has performed better than any other Magnificent Seven stock -- and there are good reasons to think that its incredible run will continue. Demand for Nvidia's high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) has soared in tandem with demand for AI services. Thanks to this catalyst, the company's sales and earnings have shot through the roof.\n\nIn the third quarter, the chipmaker posted sales of $18.12 billion, up 206% year over year. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share soared 593% compared to the prior-year period.\n\nThe company even expects sales growth to accelerate significantly in the fourth quarter. With guidance for sales of roughly $20 billion in the period, management's target calls for year-over-year growth of roughly 230%. And the GPU leader has crushed its own guidance and Wall Street's performance targets over the last year.\n\nThe business has gone from being centered around GPUs for the consumer markets to focusing on processors for data centers used by large organizations. Data center hardware will likely remain the key foundation of its business, but the AI leader might be in the early stages of a new transformation.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia already has the foundations to be the most important hardware provider for enterprise AI applications, but it's moving to bolster its own recurring-revenue base with subscription services. It's rolling out new AI-focused software and offering computations for AI apps as a service.\n\nAs the company increases the software and services component of its business, it should see strong sales and margin tailwinds. These new growth drivers and its already stellar performance make Nvidia stock still look like a great buy in 2024.\n\nMagnificent, to be sure\n\nParkev Tatevosian (Alphabet): My top Magnificent Seven stock for 2024 is Google parent Alphabet, which has an excellent business model that generates billions in revenue and profits, and sells at a relatively cheap valuation.\n\nIndeed, Alphabet's sales expanded from $56 billion in 2013 to $283 billion in 2022. The company generates revenue primarily from advertising and has benefited as marketers have been transitioning their ads to digital channels.\n\nLegacy ads were hard to target with any precision, and exact measurements of results were nearly impossible with billboards, newspapers, and magazines. (How many people saw your billboard on Sunset Boulevard? Who knows?)\n\nBut online, businesses can target their ads more precisely and see how many people clicked on their messages and made a purchase. GOOG PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nThe business has been lucrative. Alphabet's operating income soared from $15 billion to $75 billion in the years shown above. The industry is unlikely to reverse course, which could lead to growing profitability for Alphabet for several years. Although it's unlikely to grow at the rate it achieved in the previous decade.\n\nStill, that could already be reflected in Alphabet's attractive valuation. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6, a bargain given the company's dominant position in a lucrative industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "PayPal and Crypto: A Risky Mix or a Winning Formula for PYPL Stock?",
        "content": "If PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) were valued like Visa (NYSE:V), PayPal stock would rise. This could have important implications for PYPL stock investors.\n\nThe world’s biggest payment processor is now America’s most valuable bank. Its shares are up almost 20% over the last year and are now priced at 32 times earnings. PayPal, meanwhile, is down over 20% in the last year and sells at 18 times earnings.\n\nBut PayPal isn’t Visa. One reason is its big bet on crypto.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Crypto Bet\n\nPaypal runs a crypto stablecoin called PYUSD (PYUSD-USD). Stablecoins are seen as a bridge between the world of fiat currencies, like the dollar, and crypto coins, like Bitcoin (BTC-USD). If you buy something with Bitcoin, PayPal will sell your PYUSD to make the transaction work. PayPal also enables the sending of PYUSD within the U.S. without fees.\n\nThe first step in making it work for PayPal is for PYUSD to be accepted in the crypto community. PayPal is doing this with “incentives” on Curve Finance and getting it accepted at sites trading Ethereum (ETH-USD), like AAVE.\n\nThe “use case” is that PYUSD will be borrowed or lent on the platforms. Lending through a stablecoin means holding it. PayPal has $291 million in PYUSD circulating, which trades just like any cryptocurrency.\n\nEvaluating the Bet\n\nMaking this bet pay off requires that consumers start using PYUSD, and thus other forms of crypto, the same way they do dollars. It’s the transaction volume moving through PYUSD and the money made by PayPal through those transactions that matter.\n\nAll the excitement over Bitcoin’s rising price and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs play into this. The idea is that people will buy Bitcoin, see its value rise, and then use that value through PYUSD on goods and services. That’s the use case.\n\nPart of building the case is to integrate PYUSD into PayPal’s other operations, like Venmo. But until people start moving around real markets using PYUSD, it’s a risk that normal processors don’t have.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo Thanks\n\nPYPL stock does a lot of business that critics don’t trust.\n\nIt’s huge in the casino business, for instance. That’s why the stock remains “a bargain.” It’s also why some long-time holders are bailing.\n\nEven analysts who like CEO Alex Chriss have downgraded the stock recently, believing he faces a multi-year turnaround. They note that the core branded checkout business is getting hammered by the Cloud Czars, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG), who are pushing both consumers and merchants toward their wallets.\n\nAmong the recent bears is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), based on the slow growth at Venmo and its branded checkout solution. But even Morgan Stanley now rates PayPal an “equal weight” holding. They’re not telling people to sell it.\n\nAnalysts like Mizuho’s Dan Dolev are filled with advice on what Chriss should do. Prominent is the idea that PayPal should integrate all its offerings into a “super app,” a global digital wallet that handles any form of exchange and any currency, including crypto.\n\nDoes that sound familiar? It’s just what Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is doing with X, and what Musk tried to do while at PayPal back in the 1990s.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIf you believe in crypto, PayPal should be one of your core stock holdings. It’s cheap, and if PYUSD takes off, the stock is a value investor’s dream.\n\nI remain skeptical. Maybe it’s because I just turned 69. Even on PayPal’s site describing PYUSD, there’s nothing it can do that doesn’t depend, ultimately, on crypto. The costs of trading crypto directly remain dramatic. The value of crypto is held up entirely by traders. PYUSD itself is a workaround, backed by dollars, not by Bitcoin.\n\nI’d rather hold Visa or another payment processor like Fiserv (NYSE:FI).\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in AAPL and GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

        "title": "Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nAlphabet's estimated fair value is US$145 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Alphabet's US$143 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 7.2% lower than Alphabet's analyst price target of US$157\n\nHow far off is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nThe Method\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$87.7b US$99.6b US$119.2b US$123.5b US$117.3b US$114.2b US$112.8b US$112.6b US$113.2b US$114.4b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x17 Analyst x15 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ -2.67% Est @ -1.20% Est @ -0.17% Est @ 0.54% Est @ 1.05% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5%  US$81.6k US$86.2k US$95.8k US$92.4k US$81.5k US$73.8k US$67.8k US$62.9k US$58.8k US$55.3k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$756b\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$114b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$2.2t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.2t÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$1.1t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.8t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$143, the company appears about fair value at a 1.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.065. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Alphabet\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Crush 2024. Here's 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stock to Buy and Hold Forever.",
        "content": "2022 was a tough year in the stock market. Concerns stemming from a challenged economy caused pronounced selling activity, sending stocks into a nosedive. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 33% in 2022 -- marking only the sixth time in over 50 years it's dropped by that level or more.\n\nIn the midst of 2022's sell-off, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) completed a 20-for-1 stock split. Analyzing stock-split stocks can be an interesting exercise as it may shed some light on companies that have experienced higher trading volumes and witnessed a surging share price. While stock splits do not inherently increase the value of a company, seasoned investors know that following a stock split, the company's shares typically tend to see increased demand -- given its perceived lower price -- that eventually pushes up the stock price.\n\nSince splitting in July 2022, Alphabet stock has returned about 28% -- much lower than its big tech counterparts such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia. I think a lot of this has to do with artificial intelligence (AI), and which companies are seen as emerging leaders.\n\nOne could argue that Microsoft, Nvidia, and even Tesla garner the most attention when it comes to AI. Microsoft kicked off the AI race after a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT. Meanwhile, demand for Nvidia's semiconductor chips, which are used to train generative AI models, is surging, and Tesla appears to be on the brink of commercially available autonomous driving.\n\nGiven this level of competition, AI investors may have missed out on Alphabet's progress. In fact, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman thinks Alphabet's AI business is so overlooked that investors can buy it \"for free.\"\n\nI agree with Ackman's position and think Alphabet stock looks like a bargain. Let's dig into why 2024 could be a great time to buy some shares in this underappreciated AI leader.\n\nStory continues\n\nA trip down memory lane\n\nSince it was founded in 1971, the Nasdaq Composite has only generated negative returns 14 times. The only periods that the index had consecutive years of declining returns were in 1973 and 1974, as well as 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\nThese trends underscore the resiliency of the Nasdaq, given it tends to bounce back after a down year. However, while inflation is beginning to cool and many economists believe the Federal Reserve is finished with rate hikes, I wouldn't be surprised if the tumultuous market conditions from 2022 might still be lingering in the back of your mind -- causing some hesitation when it comes to tech stocks in particular.\n\nOver the last two decades, the Nasdaq has only dropped by 30% or more on three occasions -- 2002, 2008, and 2022. Interestingly, following the market crashes of 2002 and 2008, the Nasdaq went on to surge for consecutive years thereafter. From 2002 to 2007, the Nasdaq returned an average of 15.9% per year. And from 2009 to 2010, the index increased by an average of 30%.\n\nTo be clear, the past performance of the Nasdaq doesn't guarantee future results. However, given the booming demand for AI, I think 2024 could be another robust year for tech stocks following the Nasdaq's 43% bounceback return last year. Image source: Getty Images\n\nAlphabet's gains in AI could just be the beginning\n\nOver the last couple of years, the broader economy has been plagued with high inflation and borrowing costs, forcing companies of all sizes to reign in spending and operate on leaner budgets. These macroeconomic factors took their toll on many different sectors, and the technology landscape was particularly impacted as demand for expensive software applications started to wane.\n\nAs it relates to Alphabet and its gigantic advertising business, marketers have become increasingly selective in how to allocate campaign dollars. It should come as no surprise that this put Alphabet at the center of an intense battle among competing social media platforms TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nNevertheless, Alphabet has invested significant capital into new products and services -- which are already helping the company return to growth. It's been integrating AI capabilities across its entire ecosystem, including areas such as Google Cloud, Google Search, video-sharing website YouTube, and productivity tools within Google Workspace.\n\nAdditionally, the release of its ChatGPT competitor called Gemini could just be the catalyst the company needs to be considered a leader among AI developers. Yet despite all of these exciting gains, Alphabet stock isn't garnering a premium commensurate with its big-tech counterparts -- making the stock a tempting buy at its current valuation.\n\nAlphabet stock looks dirt cheap GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. At a forward P/E of 20.3, Alphabet stock is effectively tied for last place with Meta. Moreover, this is right in line with the S&P 500's forward P/E of 20.7 -- possibly signaling that investors don't expect Alphabet to outperform the broader markets.\n\nTo me, Alphabet stock is absurdly undervalued. Despite cooling inflation and the possibility of Federal Reserve tapering interest rates this year, I suspect that many are wary over the company's growth prospects. More specifically, the company's rebound in advertising in 2023 is encouraging -- but keep in mind that revenue only increased 7% year over year through the first nine months of 2023.\n\nI think this is a short-sighted concern, especially with 2024 containing tailwinds that could boost digital advertising platforms. Furthermore, Alphabet is making notable strides in cloud computing -- a market largely dominated by Amazon and Microsoft right now.\n\nThere's no doubt that Alphabet has a lot to prove. But keep in mind that the stock has returned over 5,300% to investors since its initial public offering in 2004. Even just a $1,000 investment 20 years ago would now be worth roughly $54,000.\n\nTo me, this underscores Alphabet's strong performance over a long-term time horizon. While the company will likely continue fending off an increasing number of competitors, I think management is taking impressive actions to diversify Alphabet's products and services and building the foundation for long-term sustained growth. With the stock trading at such a bargain, now looks like an amazing opportunity to scoop up shares and hold on for the ride.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analsyt comments.\n\nJPMorgan upgrades Dell, promotes Arista\n\nJPMorgan analysts upgraded Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) to Overweight from Neutral, citing the company’s leverage to the AI-led Compute investment cycle.\n\nThe cycle “will benefit branded server companies (DELL and HPE in our coverage), even as the drivers for the remaining businesses are more mixed, being subject to the macro backdrop,” the analyst said.\n\nSimilarly, they promoted Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) to top pick on accelerating growth from AI ramp.\n\n“We expect the valuation premium currently (33x P/E vs. long-term average of 28x) to be sustained or even expand as AI revenues ramp, driving higher visibility into the driver for growth acceleration.”\n\nBMO says Alphabet and Amazon best-positioned AI wise\n\nBMO initiated research coverage of 25 stocks in the internet sector, including sub sectors like digital advertising, ecommerce, online travel, advertising/marketing-tech and interactive media.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, BMO analysts highlighted Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as best-positioned to “benefit from the proliferation of generative AI and large language models.”\n\n“While the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014 resulted in a step function increase in AI capabilities, Google has integrated machine learning (“ML”) into its core products since 2000 – this effectively gives Alphabet a 10+ year head start relative to the industry.”\n\nElsewhere, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also mentioned as the e-commerce stock is expected “to benefit from artificial intelligence/machine learning given its investments in Trainium and Inferentia chips as well as the middle layer of the stack in Bedrock and CodeWhisperer.”\n\nAI rises to the top of the CIO's priority list\n\nThe anticipation of increased growth in IT spending for 2024 remains consistent, as reflected in Morgan Stanley’s Q4 CIO survey. Aligned with heightened investor enthusiasm, CIOs have elevated AI and ML to the forefront of their Priority List, with 68% acknowledging its impact on their existing IT budgets.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our 4Q23 CIO survey suggested overall IT spending growth accelerates from 2.6% in 2023 to 3.3% in 2024, but still below the 4.1% 10-year average (preCovid) AI/ML rose to the top of the CIO priority list for the first time, followed by Data Warehousing/Analytics and Security,” analysts said.\n\n“Perhaps most surprisingly, post optimization the percentage of workloads running in the Public Cloud jumped from 29% in our 2Q23 survey to 36% in 4Q23. The percentage of workloads expected to run in the Public Cloud 3 years forward expanded from 46% to 53%.”\n\nMarvell PT raised at BofA\n\nBank of America analysts raised the price target for Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) from $68 to $80 per share.\n\nThis positive revision is grounded in the progress of the custom AI chip ramp. Following discussions with the company's management team during the CES tradeshow in Las Vegas, BofA observed promising trends in cloud AI demand, influencing the decision to raise the price target.\n\n\"Our discussions with NVDA and MRVL were very positive, with both vendors (along with AVGO, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)) supplying critical compute and networking parts to cloud customers,\" said BofA.\n\n\"The MRVL discussion indicated their custom AI chip ramp could be 1.5-2x the $250mn/$450mn we assumed prior for CY24/25E.\"\n\nBaidu primed to be an active AI contributor - Macquarie\n\nMacquarie started coverage of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) with an Outperform rating and set a target price of $150 per share, according to a note released on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts communicated to investors that Baidu's strategic emphasis on its core advertising business is expected to contribute to a stable market share. Furthermore, the company is poised to capitalize on a potential cyclical rebound in advertising budgets, indicating additional room for growth.\n\n\"Baidu has been allocating above-average R&D resources to build a full-stack AI that covers both to-enterprise and to-consumer scenarios,\" added the analysts.\n\n\"While revenue contribution from GenAI remains small at low-single-digit %, we expect Baidu to maintain its leading position in China's AI Cloud market on the back of its strong AI capabilities and improving market recognition.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Alphabet and Amazon attract new Street fans\n\nMedi Assist, Maxposure, New Swan, and Australian Premium Solar set for IPOs\n\nSaudi Arabia stocks lower at close of trade; Tadawul All Share down 0.46%",

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: My Top 10 Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "After falling more than 25% in 2022, the stock market came roaring back in 2023, and history suggests there's more to come. The S&P 500 closed just shy of its all-time high as of market close on Tuesday. When it does finally hit a new record high, that event combined with a more than 20% increase from its recent low will mark the start of the next bull market.\n\nSo why does it matter? Well, since 1957, bull markets on average have lasted nearly five years, rewarding investors with average gains of just over 169%. Going back to the beginning of trading for the Nasdaq Composite in 1972, history shows that in every year following a market recovery, the tech-centric index has generated average annual gains of 19%.\n\nThe economy is generally unpredictable, so things could still get worse before they get better, but the historical data suggests a good year is ahead for investors.\n\nThere are many reasons to buy a stock, and many of them include the expectation that the stock will ultimately make investors money. One of those reasons is a bull market tends to benefit a lot of stocks. Here are my top 10 growth stocks to buy for 2024 before the bull market charges ahead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nA significant decline in digital advertising in 2022 and a pause in the growth of cloud spending hit Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) hard, but the improving economy is sparking a rebound. Google remains the global search leader, the world's largest online advertiser, and a \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure provider, which will continue to buoy its fortunes.\n\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst will be Alphabet's efforts involving artificial intelligence (AI). Alphabet recently rolled out Gemini, a program it claims is the most advanced generative AI system yet. It also offers more than 100 prebuilt AI models via Google Cloud and custom tools to make users more productive.\n\nThis gives Alphabet multiple catalysts to boost its stock in 2024. Trading at 4 times forward sales, the stock is historically cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nEconomic headwinds, led by soaring inflation, weighed heavily on Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2022, but green shoots of growth are appearing across its vast operations. Digital retail is bouncing back, and AI is boosting cloud spending, fueling its two largest growth areas.\n\nThe company has also planted its stake in AI, providing cloud customers with all the top generative AI models via Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company continues to integrate AI into every aspect of its operations, improving productivity along the way.\n\nThe twin tailwinds of an improving economy and AI will drive Alphabet higher. Trading at just 2 times forward sales, the stock is a steal.\n\n3. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) is likely the least well-known company on this list. It's the leading provider of e-commerce and digital payments services in Latin America, and business is brisk. In the third quarter, revenue climbed 69%, while operating income surged 194% -- despite generating record-setting growth last year.\n\nThis trend is expected to continue. The adoption of e-commerce in the region is among the fastest in the world, and with a population of nearly 668 million, it's twice the size of the U.S., so its pool of potential customers is much larger.\n\nAdd to that MercadoLibre's margin expansion and strong cash flow, and investors shouldn't sleep on this Latin American powerhouse.\n\n4. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) suffered from the same headwinds as its tech rivals but responded by kicking off the AI gold rush with a $13 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. What followed was a flurry of activity, integrating generative AI tools across its suite of products and services and AI cloud offerings. Its AI-fueled digital assistant Copilot is seeing robust demand, the headliner in the \"fastest-growing $10 billion business\" in Microsoft's history.\n\nThe demand is unmistakable. Microsoft's Azure cloud revenue growth outpaced rivals in the calendar third quarter, with three percentage points of that growth attributable to demand for AI.\n\nThe stock is selling for 32 times forward earnings, particularly reasonable in light of its prospects.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) processors have long been the gold standard for gaming, data center, and artificial intelligence (AI) use cases, capitalizing on the generative AI boom that hit last year. The resulting shortage of AI chips is expected to persist through 2024. Nvidia ramped up production to meet the accelerating demand and continues pouring money into research and development, creating ever-improving solutions.\n\nThe company has generated triple-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth in each of the past two quarters, and soaring demand for AI is expected to continue. Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 is cheaper than the broader market, making this stock a steal.\n\n6. Palantir Technologies\n\nWith decades of experience under its belt, Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) was ready when AI went viral last year. The company quickly pivoted, adding generative AI models to its repertoire, which work hand in hand with Palantir's AI-powered data analytics. The resulting Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has generated robust interest, and management said, \"Demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past 20 years.\"\n\nThe stock might seem pricey at 11 times forward sales, but with four successive quarters of profitability, Palantir is \"eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500,\" management noted on the company's recent earnings call. As one of the few pure-play AI stocks out there, Palantir is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI gold rush.\n\n7. Roku\n\nDespite a punishing couple of years, Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) remains the world's most widely used streaming platform, with 51% of the market. The dearth of ad spending last year has begun to lift, and with multiple viewers across its 76 million active accounts, it's a compelling opportunity advertisers can't ignore, fueling ad growth on its platform.\n\nFurthermore, the secular tailwinds of cord-cutting and the deterioration of broadcast viewing have caused an ongoing advertising shift from broadcast to streaming. Roku is the one place to reach these highly engaged viewers, who consumed 26.7 billion hours, or roughly 3.9 hours per day. And at roughly 3 times forward sales, investors are getting a bargain.\n\n8. Shopify\n\nWith the downturn largely in the rearview mirror, things are looking up for Shopify(NYSE: SHOP). E-commerce spending has returned to growth, and as the leading provider of software tools for online merchants, Shopify is positioned to thrive. The company released new generative AI tools to help sellers prosper and it has a minority stake in Global-e Online, which helps merchants expand into international markets.\n\nShopify streamlined its operations last year, trimming staff and shedding its logistics business to focus on its mission to empower digital retailers. This has fueled strong growth and profitability, making Shopify a compelling opportunity for investors.\n\n9. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has a reputation as a battleground stock, but it continues to defy detractors. Last year, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car by a comfortable margin, a first for an electric vehicle. Despite headwinds and price adjustments -- which led to temporary profit declines -- the company continued to drive further into the automotive mainstream.\n\nWith inflation cooling and interest rates expected to drop next year, conditions will be much more favorable for Tesla. This could help the company return to its long-term production goal of 50% annual growth while also helping expand its profit margins.\n\nFinally, 5 times forward sales is a pretty reasonable valuation, especially considering the stock price gains of more than 2,300% over the past decade.\n\n10. The Trade Desk\n\nSome investors were surprised by the impact the aforementioned decline in marketing spending in 2022 had on The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD). The company's self-service digital advertising platform actually took market share from the walled gardens, including Alphabet and Meta Platforms, notching growth even as its rivals suffered year-over-year revenue declines.\n\nLate last year, CEO Jeff Green said, \"Over the last few quarters ... we have gained more market share than in any other period in our company's history.\" The Trade Desk's recently released Koa AI copilot should fuel this trend, helping advertisers get the most out of their ad campaigns.\n\nFinally, with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the standard for an underpriced stock -- the Trade Desk is a compelling bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "2 Stock-Spilt Stocks Crushing It in Artificial Intelligence That Could Soar in 2024",
        "content": "Data from Grand View Research shows that the artificial intelligence (AI) market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the decade's end. So it's not surprising that countless tech firms have restructured their businesses to prioritize AI, thus creating multiple ways to invest in the budding industry.\n\nDespite a surge in AI stocks last year, the market's immense potential indicates it's not too late for new investors to see major gains from the market. Meanwhile, companies that have recently split their shares are attractive options, as the move is often followed by significant growth.\n\nHere are two stock-split stocks crushing it in AI that could soar in 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded in recent years, with its shares soaring more than 1,300% since 2019. Stellar growth led management to trigger a 4-to-1 stock split in July 2021, its fifth split since 2000. And the company appears to just be getting started.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Nvidia emerged as one of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, achieving an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. The company's years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) allowed it to get a head start, while rivals like AMD and Intel have yet to catch up.\n\nIncreased demand for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) has seen Nvidia's earnings soar. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206%, with operating income up more than 1,600% thanks to a spike in chip sales in its data center segment. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. That figure, multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45, implies a potential stock price of $1,080, projecting growth of 97% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a lucrative role in AI and tech in general. The company will need to contend with increased competition this year as other companies release new chips. However, its dominance will be challenging to overcome.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the market's growth potential suggests there's enough room for Nvidia to retain its lead and welcome newcomers. As a result, this stock-split stock is too good to pass up in the new year.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, it's impossible to deny Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) powerful role in tech. Its stock has risen 402% over the last decade, with its last split occurring in July 2022 in a 20-to-1 split.\n\nMuch of the company's success over the years stems from the billions of users its services attract. Alphabet has used its massive user base to build a lucrative digital advertising business, responsible for about 25% of the $740 billion digital ad market. Popular platforms like Google Search and YouTube present almost endless advertising opportunities for the company and have helped its earnings soar in recent years.\n\nSince 2019, Alphabet's annual revenue rose 75%, with operating income up 108%. Meanwhile, the company's free cash flow has climbed 200% in the last five years to $78 billion, indicating that Alphabet has the funds to invest heavily in its research and development and venture into burgeoning areas of tech -- such as AI.\n\nIn December, the tech giant unveiled its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini, which is expected to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4. The new model could open the door to countless growth opportunities in AI for Alphabet.\n\nGemini and the popularity of platforms like Google Search, Cloud, and YouTube could be a powerful combination. The company could have an advantage in AI with the ability to create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, add new AI tools on Google Cloud, offer more efficient advertising, and better track viewing trends on YouTube. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThese charts show Alphabet's stock is also significantly cheaper than that of its biggest competitors in AI, fellow cloud giants Microsoft and Amazon. The company has lower figures in two key valuation metrics: forward P/E and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratios. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/FCF divides its market cap by free cash flow. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nForward P/E and P/FCF are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In this case, Alphabet is a far bigger bargain than Microsoft or Amazon.\n\nAlongside a solid outlook in AI and consistent financial growth, Alphabet is a screaming buy in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia. Here's a Better \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock for 2024.",
        "content": "Among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) had the best run in 2023, rising 239%. With that kind of one-year performance, investors shouldn't expect another repeat, or even for Nvidia to once again claim the crown of the best \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in 2024.\n\nInstead, I think investors should be looking at Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) to outperform its peers. Alphabet also had a strong 2023, up 58%. But it's valued much lower than Nvidia despite strong tailwinds. This all adds up to what should be a phenomenal year for Alphabet stock in 2024.\n\nAds are still Alphabet's primary business\n\nFirst and foremost, Alphabet's primary business is advertising. While most people are excited about its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities or cloud computing, the reality is that nearly 80% of revenue comes from its ad business.\n\nAlphabet has multiple ad streams, but its largest is its Google Search division. While this segment struggled throughout late 2022 and early 2023, the third quarter was different, as it grew revenue by 11% to $44 billion. Another key platform is YouTube, which holds the highest screen time among all streaming services. Revenue grew 12% in Q3, but expect this segment to have a big year as ad spending bounces back. Data source: Nielsen.\n\nWhile ads keep the lights on for Alphabet, other investments are starting to take shape.\n\nAlphabet's AI bets are starting to take form\n\nArtificial intelligence has been a key investment theme for Alphabet ever since CEO Sundar Pichai declared Alphabet an AI-first company. While this takes several forms (including optimizing the ad business to be more AI-powered), the latest iteration has been generative AI.\n\nThis movement took the world by storm when ChatGPT became popular in late 2022, and multiple companies began offering generative AI solutions for business. However, these models need to be built on a platform, and Alphabet's Gemini looks like a top option. Gemini beat the competition in several key benchmark tests, including becoming the first model to outperform human experts on the massive multitask language understanding test. Alphabet has yet to monetize this platform, but investors can expect that sometime in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso in Alphabet's AI aspirations is its cloud computing business, Google Cloud. Google Cloud currently sits in third place in terms of market share, but that position isn't a big deal considering how large this market is. Google Cloud has steadily grown above 20% year over year, yet hasn't optimized for profits. With an operating margin of just 3%, Google Cloud could be a massive profit boost when the company changes its mindset from growth at all costs to profitability. While that likely won't happen in 2024, it's a long-term booster for investors to consider.\n\nDespite these strong tailwinds, Alphabet still trades at a reasonable valuation.\n\nAlphabet's stock is attractively priced\n\nAlphabet's stock looks far more reasonable than Nvidia's 70 times trailing and 43 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nA valuation of 20 times forward earnings isn't a bad price, especially considering that Alphabet's stock hasn't traded that low in some time. Furthermore, with the right conditions, Alphabet could easily surpass these projections, making it an even better stock to own in 2024.\n\nWhile Nvidia is still a strong business, the stock has gotten ahead of itself. Investors are better off purchasing a stock like Alphabet right now, which provides growth at a reasonable price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theAnalysts Say These 13 AI Stocks Will Skyrocket in 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Analysts Say These 5 AI Stocks Will Skyrocket in 2024.\n\nWhile there's a strong debate out there on whether or not the Magnificent Seven group of stocks would be able to sustain their rally in 2024, there's hardly anyone questioning the permanence and significance of the AI revolution. In its 2024 outlook report by titled AI: More to Come in 2024, UBS cited Bloomberg Intelligence data which said the global AI demand is set to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $300 billion in 2027.\n\nUBS said in its report that 2024 would be the year of quality stocks. The firm defined quality stocks as those having strong returns on invested capital, healthy operating margins and low debt.  UBS said these quality indicators are found in the technology sector.\n\n\"This quality tilt speaks in favor of US technology companies. Technology offers the highest ROIC of the 11 US equity sectors: around 20% over the last 12 months (compared with around 3–4% for utilities or real estate). Tech sector balance sheets are also the strongest, with an average net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of just 0.5x. With business models that combine subscription-based revenue streams with a presence in high-growth segments including artificial intelligence, we think tech companies look poised to deliver healthy earnings growth next year. Stocks have already rallied hard in anticipation of higher AI demand, yet we think companies across the AI value chain— from cloud to semis, software, and internet—have further to run, both in 2024 and over the longer term. We believe that investors looking for exposure to AI should seek broad exposure across the value chain.\" Analysts Say These 5 AI Stocks Will Skyrocket in 2024\n\nPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we picked 13 stocks about which Wall Street is excited about when it comes to AI. Many notable analyst firms like Wedbush, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, among others, upgraded these stocks citing AI-related catalysts. With each stock we mentioned why the Street is bullish on it with specific catalysts and bullish analyst thesis. Some notable plays include Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13. Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nWedbush in its December 2023 report named Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) as one of its top favorite tech stocks for 2024. In July 2023, Dan Ives of Wedbush called Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) the “Messi” of AI, saying the market is still not recognizing the potential of Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) in what the analyst called a $1 trillion opportunity. Ives at the time said that Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) could skyrocket to $25 per share. As of January 7 the stock was trading at around $15.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR). The most significant stake in Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) is owned by D E Shaw which owns a $388 million stake in Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR).\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR)’s stock moved higher on hopes that it could win business from the U.K.’s National Health Services and as customer counts grew rapidly in the latest quarterly report for the company’s new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Palantir also won a significant new contract with the U.S. Army in September, which should last through 2026. The debate on the street is how fast Palantir can monetize its new commercial customers. After the quarter closed, the company announced an enhanced marketing deal with a major auditing and consulting firm.”\n\n12. Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nWealth advisor Luke Lloyd said while talking to CNBC that Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) is one of the biggest and the best consulting firms in the world and Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) would play a key role in helping other companies in implementing AI technologies. The analyst said companies turn to consulting firms like Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) when they want to implement newer technologies and that is what makes Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) one of the AI stocks to watch in 2024.\n\nMany other analyst firms are bullish on Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN). Back in December, BMO Capital increased its price target on the stock to $35.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN).\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN), a business and IT services consultant, will be instrumental in helping enterprises reinvent and modernize their IT architecture for AI. The company recently announced a $3 billion investment, which includes doubling their data and AI workforce to 80,000 to address this growing opportunity.”\n\n11. Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 63\n\nWealth advisor Luke Lloyd in a latest program on CNBC counted Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX), or Raytheon, among the under-the-radar AI stocks he’s watching this year. Lloyd is bullish on the stock amid geopolitical tensions in the world that help defense companies like Raytheon. While the analyst did not talk about the AI offerings of Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX), Raytheon is being pitched as an AI play because of several AI technologies. Last year, Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX) revealed a new airborne sensor called “Raiven” which Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX) says will use artificial intelligence (AI) to identify targets in real time.\n\nOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 63 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX). The most significant stake in Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX) belongs to Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $682 million stake in Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX).\n\nCarillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) lowered its free cash flow guidance for the year due to a new issue in its jet engine business. Although the company’s management has a solution, the total implementation cost remains unknown, which caused the stock to react negatively.”\n\n10. Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nCloud security company Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) uses AI in its platforms. The company is also introducing new generative AI tools in its product suite. Recently, Oppenheimer chose Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) as its top 2024 pick and set a $290 price target, which is much higher than the stock's current price of $230.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Notable trims in the quarter included Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), BioNTech and Ingersoll Rand. Zscaler provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced solid financial results including 43% revenue growth and 38% growth in billings, which were both ahead of expectations. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (e.g., Office 365 and Salesforce) and more remote workers than before the pandemic make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. The stock has been a top performer this year, and we decided to trim the position based on valuation considerations.”\n\n9. Mongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 62\n\nIn December 2023, Wedbush said in a report that the tech bull run was just getting started and the firm was extremely bullish on technology stocks because of the boom in AI. Mongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) was one of the favorite stock picks of Wedbush for 2024.\n\n\"We view AI as the most transformative technology trend since the start of the Internet in 1995 and believe many on the Street are still underestimating the $1 trillion of AI spend set to happen over the next decade in a bonanza for the chip and software sectors looking forward with Nvidia and Redmond leading the way,\" Wedbush’s analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note.\n\nMongodb management talked about how the company is using AI for business during Q3 earnings call:\n\nFirst, AI is in nearly every conversation with customers of all sizes. We’re seeing great early feedback from our partnership with AWS’s CodeWhisperer, the AI-powered coding companion that is now trained on MongoDB data to generate code suggestions based on MongoDB’s best practices from over 15 years of history. Microsoft GitHub Copilot is also proficient at generating code suggestions that reflect best practices, enabling developers to build highly-performing applications even faster on MongoDB. And with the recent advances in Gen AI, building AI applications is no longer the sole domain of AI or ML experts, increasingly it’s software developers who are being asked to build powerful AI functionality directly into their applications. We are well-positioned to help them do just that. We saw exceptional interest in our Vector Search public preview and we announced general availability yesterday. Customers are building a range of AI use cases from semantic search to retrieval augmented generation or RAG where organizations can leverage the use of their private data, to increase the accuracy of LLMs. For example, UKG, a human capital and workflows management technology serves over 80,000 plus customers around the globe chose to use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for an AI-powered assistant that helps guide their customers employees, people managers, and HR leaders.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n8. Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nCybersec company Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks 8th in our list of the best AI stocks to buy for 2024 according to Wall Street analysts. It is one of the top picks for 2024 according to Dan Ives of Wedbush.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) is aiming to use AI in cyber security systems. Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) released Charlotte AI, its generative AI “security analyst.”\n\nRecently, Jefferies increased its price target on CrowdstrikeCrowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) to $50. Oppenheimer also increased its price target on the stock to $60.\n\nLike CRWD, hedge funds and analysts also like Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike gained amid resilient cybersecurity spend, continued revenue growth against well-managed expenses, and traction in endpoint adjacencies.\n\nWe have underscored that the purpose of our risk management framework is to enhance value creation and aid in the execution and implementation of our investment program. However, this stage of risk management best manifests itself in down markets as it did in 2022. This year has been quite different since equities have broadly recovered, and our risk management focus has shifted toward establishing a level of permanence. We characterize this phase of risk management as Value Capture. Essentially, we have harvested disproportionate equity outcomes (Nvidia)and other strong performers (Passport holdings such as CrowdStrike) to fund a ~700bps increase in our India weighting (Makemytrip, Apollo Healthcare), a 235bps investment in Coca Cola (in correlation terms the real thing), and even a 114bps position in Alibaba (6.6X consensus 2023 EPS at purchase). These investments are not risk free, but they are stores of value that have the potential to enhance diversification and staying power in any market reversal. Moreover, we have marginally reduced portfolio concentration over the course of the year. Essentially, 2022 was a moment of extremely low reinvestment risk that allowed us to deemphasize China and other holdings, while concentrating around a handful of financially and strategically sound investments such as Nvidia, MercadoLibre, Airbnb and CrowdStrike.With these investments having largely reflated, we have sought to redistribute some of this capital while retaining significant residual positions. It is our hope that these actions can enhance our ability to execute our investment program if, for example, market exuberance about monetary policy proves excessive.”\n\n7. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 79\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) is another stock in the list of Wedbush’s top AI and tech picks for 2024, according to the firm’s report published in December 2023.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) has been consistently scoring price target increases and ratings upgrades from notable Wall Street analysts. Earlier this month, Jefferies increased its price target on the stock to $65.\n\nIn addition to Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), PANW is a top AI stock pick.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 79 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Across the Information Technology universe, we seek companies possessing differentiated capabilities, products, and services. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) supplies network and cloud-based security solutions to enterprises, service providers, and government entities. The latest quarter was mixed with the company falling shy versus the Street on billings, in line for revenues, and outpacing earnings. Palo Alto’s updated guidance was materially ahead of lowered Street expectations. Nevertheless, its shares pulled back by -8%.”\n\n6. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 99\n\nFuturum Group's Daniel Newman thinks ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) is one of the stocks that will benefit in 2024 and beyond because ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) is among the “pick-and-shovel” technology providers when it comes to AI.\n\nRecently, BofA increased its price target on ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) to $90. Jefferies has also increased its price target on the stock to $125.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 99 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW). The most significant stakeholder of ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) during this period was Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners which owns an $832 million stake in ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW).\n\nIn its October 2023 investor letter, Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW):\n\n“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) also delivered a strong quarterly result that surprised on the upside. Subscription revenues grew 27% year-on-year to $2.29 billion and non-GAAP operating income grew 41%, both exceeding analyst expectations and the company’s own guidance. Key performance indicators were healthy, with current remaining performance obligations growing 27% year-on-year to $7.4 billion and renewal rates holding firm at 98%. Despite the challenging macro environment for many software companies, ServiceNow’s multi-product platform continues to resonate with large enterprise customers with the number of clients spending over $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) up 17% year-on-year to 1,789, while the cohort spending over $20 million swelled by 58% year-on-year to 49. Helping drive some of that product adoption was their Creator Workflows module, first launched near the start of 2021, which crossed the $1 billion ACV threshold this quarter.\n\nWe remain impressed by the execution from management, who continue to expand the company’s total addressable market with new product launches that generate significant return on investment for their customers. Right before the quarter ended, they launched the Vancouver Platform release, which embedded generative AI across all workflows on the Now Platform and managed to close four large deals in a single day. Their generative AI offering drove the highest number of customer requests ever for a prerelease product in the company’s history, providing an attractive pipeline of new deals. Overall, we have high conviction in their growth trajectory and are happy to remain patient shareholders.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Analysts Say These 5 AI Stocks Will Skyrocket in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Analysts 11 Most Promising Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks According to Analysts 16 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Apple could have a new problem: Uncle Sam",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). Until now.\n\nThe Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apple’s closely guarded ecosystem. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.\n\n\"You don't ramp up unless you find that there's something significant there that you want to investigate,\" adjunct Columbia University Law School professor Martin Edel said about the reported probe. The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.\n\nStill, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.\n\nThreatening the 'walled garden'\n\nApple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.\n\nApple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.\n\nBut the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.\n\nStory continues\n\nA DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.\n\nBut Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nEdel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position. The iPhone 15 Pro is presented during the \"Wonderlust\" event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. (Loren Elliott/REUTERS/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nApple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to reign in Big Tech.\n\n\"The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,\" Edel said.\n\nUniversity of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.\n\nFor one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.\n\n\"If I were Apple, I’d be pretty worried about this,\" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the world’s top antitrust litigators in-house. The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after its unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCritics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.\n\nThe company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.\n\nInteroperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.\n\nThe Epic effect\n\nThere are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.\n\nOne is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.\n\nIn that case, the appeals court upheld a California trial court's ruling that said Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.\n\nHowever, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.\n\nApple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which has yet to say whether it will hear the case. What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit, Newman said, would depend on where the department chose to file its case. \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games' chief executive Tim Sweeney leaves after a weekslong antitrust trial at federal court in Oakland, Calif, in 2021. (Brittany Hosea-Small/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\"They could take the fight to Apple’s doorstep, but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case,\" Newman said. \"DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.\"\n\nGoogle's battle\n\nThe second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.\n\nClosing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.\n\nThe lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.\n\nIf the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.\n\nThose talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google has unveiled generative AI solutions in a bid to expand its reach to various retailers.\r\n\r\nThese tools are designed to help retailers deliver enhanced shopping experiences to customers. This way, the retailers will be able to expand their customer reach, which, in turn, will boost their sales.\r\n\r\nThe latest announcement comes ahead of the National Retail Federation's annual conference, which will be held from Jan 13 to Jan 17 in New York.\r\n\r\nThus, it is marked as a significant step for Google to gain a strong footprint in the retail industry. It is also experiencing a growing proliferation of generative AI, like other industries. The increasing number of use cases in the retail industry remains noteworthy.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nMore on the New Tools\n\nOne of these tools is a chatbot, namely Conversational Commerce Solution, which features generative AI-powered virtual agents that can be integrated into retailers’ websites and mobile apps.\r\n\r\nThe tool is based on Google’s large language models (“LLMs”), PaLM and Imagen, which enable it to create and generate product descriptions, metadata and categorization suggestions automatically.\r\n \r\nThis way, retailers will be able to offer product recommendations based on shoppers’ preferences via chats between the virtual agent and customers. Also, they will be able to generate new product images from existing ones.\r\n\r\nThe company also introduced a new LLM feature, which is meant to improve product searches. \r\n\r\nThe new tools line up also includes solutions that are designed to strengthen retailers’ customer service systems and product cataloging processes.\r\n\r\nComing to offline retail, the company announced a managed self-contained hardware tool called Google Distributed Cloud Edge, which is specifically for stores like convenience marts, gas stations, grocery shops and even casual restaurants. The tool helps these stores reduce IT costs and resource investments.\r\n\r\nWith all these tools, Alphabet is expected to gain solid momentum among various retailers, which in turn will contribute well to its financial performance.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $283.34 billion, indicating growth of 11.2% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe same for 2024 earnings is pinned at $6.74 per share, indicating growth of 15.6% year over year. The figure has moved north by 0.7% in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the retail prospects, the latest move is in sync with Alphabet’s growing endeavors to strengthen its generative AI offerings, which in turn are expected to aid it in capitalizing on the growth prospects present in the booming generative AI space.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market’s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nApart from the latest move, Alphabet’s introduction of a generative AI-backed online shopping feature, which allows users to try on clothes virtually, is a positive.\r\n\r\nThe feature helps customers understand how an apparel item will look on them, as it allows them to try clothes ranging from XXS to 4XL sizes. Further, it is designed to generate lifelike images by considering how a particular fabric stretches and wrinkles when worn.\r\n\r\nGOOGL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe company’s expanding, technology-driven offerings in the retail industry are expected to stiffen the competition for e-commerce players like Amazon AMZN, eBay EBAY and Shopify SHOP that are also making concerted efforts to bolster AI-backed retail capabilities as well as solutions for other retailers.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s unveiling of generative AI-powered tools for sellers remains noteworthy. These tools, which are based on using LLM, are designed to aid sellers in generating good product descriptions, including titles and other listing details. With the new tools, sellers can also add or update their existing product descriptions.\r\n\r\neBay offers an AI tool for marketplace sellers that can create a product listing by automatically generating a title, description and information like product release date, category, subcategory, list price and shipping cost from a single photo.\r\n\r\nThe photo-to-listing AI tool addresses the \"cold start\" issue experienced by first-time sellers by removing the need to enter extensive information for competitive listings.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Shopify Magic, Shopify’s newly launched AI tool, comes with the added feature of AI-generated product descriptions with a built-in wordsmith in the merchant’s admin.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the10 Best AI Stocks for 2024. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article 5 Best AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nThe latest inflation report has yet again made investors uneasy about the Fed's possible path forward. The persistent shadow of inflation is perhaps here to stay for some time and investors will adapt to this new environment. Stifel said in its 2024 outlook report themed \"Embracing Change\" that higher rates are \"here to stay\" as the firm expects muted but positive returns for stocks this year. However, Stifel said that inflation is clearly showing signs of deceleration and risks are now \"balanced.\"\n\nStifel recommended long-term investors to maintain their \"composure\" in 2024 and embrace the fact that change is the only constant in life. While sooner or later inflation will recede and rates will come down, what is here to stay and change the course of human progress is AI, which, according to Stifel, \"stands on the cusp of reshaping industries and the economy.\"\n\nThe AI revolution is that once-in-a-century kind of phenomenon that will shape and impact our society at every level. PwC said in a report said that its 2023 Emerging Technology Survey showed that just one year after the launch of ChatGPT, 54% of the surveyed companies had already implemented generative AI in some areas of their business. Companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are already launching AI products and services affecting billions of users around the globe. Best AI Stocks for 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this context, we decided to take look at some of the top AI stocks that hedge funds are piling into. For this article we first listed all popular companies that are set to gain and profit from the latest AI trends. These companies are receiving bullish comments, ratings upgrades and price target hikes from analysts because of their products and services related to AI. From this long list of stocks we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. The idea was to see which AI-related stocks are the favorites of smart money investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the most notable stocks that is gaining attention on the back of AI-related catalysts. Dan Ives of Wedbush in December listed the stock among his favorite AI and tech plays of 2024.\n\n\"While IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, we believe cloud and AI driven spending will be up 20%-25% over the next year with use cases now exploding across the enterprise and consumer landscape,” Ives said in his note.\n\nCharlotte AI is one of the generative AI products offered by Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) that have been making waves. Charlotte AI is a chatbot which can be probed by end users and security analysts regarding their system’s deficiencies and best security practices.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike gained amid resilient cybersecurity spend, continued revenue growth against well-managed expenses, and traction in endpoint adjacencies.\n\nWe have underscored that the purpose of our risk management framework is to enhance value creation and aid in the execution and implementation of our investment program. However, this stage of risk management best manifests itself in down markets as it did in 2022. This year has been quite different since equities have broadly recovered, and our risk management focus has shifted toward establishing a level of permanence. We characterize this phase of risk management as Value Capture. Essentially, we have harvested disproportionate equity outcomes (Nvidia)and other strong performers (Passport holdings such as CrowdStrike) to fund a ~700bps increase in our India weighting (Makemytrip, Apollo Healthcare), a 235bps investment in Coca Cola (in correlation terms the real thing), and even a 114bps position in Alibaba (6.6X consensus 2023 EPS at purchase). These investments are not risk free, but they are stores of value that have the potential to enhance diversification and staying power in any market reversal. Moreover, we have marginally reduced portfolio concentration over the course of the year. Essentially, 2022 was a moment of extremely low reinvestment risk that allowed us to deemphasize China and other holdings, while concentrating around a handful of financially and strategically sound investments such as Nvidia, MercadoLibre, Airbnb and CrowdStrike.With these investments having largely reflated, we have sought to redistribute some of this capital while retaining significant residual positions. It is our hope that these actions can enhance our ability to execute our investment program if, for example, market exuberance about monetary policy proves excessive.”\n\n9. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 112\n\nAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the companies best positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) has integrated AI features in its product suite that allows end users to simply give text-based commands to design graphics and edit photos. These features are expected to increase Adobe Inc's (NASDAQ:ADBE) product demand.\n\nJim Cramer said in a program a few months back that Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) made the “best use of AI.”\n\nA total of 112 hedge funds out of the 109 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) as of the end of the third quarter. The most significant stakeholder of Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) was Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $2.3 billion stake in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nIn addition to Adobe, hedge funds are also piling into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 110\n\nMany analysts are betting that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will be one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the AI boom. After all, Nvidia won’t be the only company making chips for generative AI systems. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has a history of catching up to its competition and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is already out with its new AI-focused chips.\n\nIn December, UBS called Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) one of its top semiconductor picks. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in his note that the semiconductor industry was entering a “sweet spot” and 2024 will see inventory converting to revenue.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 110 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”\n\n7. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 122\n\nEarlier this month, Bank of America added Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) in its top software stock picks for 2024.\n\n\"We expect mid-teen revenue growth, improving margins, multiple reversion and positive revisions to offset cyclical headwinds in [first-half of 2024] before driving a stronger [second half of 2024],” BofA’s Alkesh Shah said.\n\nAbout Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Shah said he sees \"enduring\" revenue growth in the mid-teens and increasing margins.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”\n\n6. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 221\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of frontrunners in the AI race since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) has the vantage point that allows it to integrate AI technologies into various services and products. Recently, BMO Capital Markets Brian Pitz said in a note that the blend of AI and content creation would help Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) along with several other tech companies. He started covering the stock with an Outperform rating.\n\nA total of 221 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds had stakes in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The biggest stakeholder of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) during this period was Ken Fisher’ s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $5.7 billion stake in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included long positions in KKR, Ciena Corporation and Alphabet. Shares of media and technology company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) rose in the quarter as its advertising and cloud businesses remain robust and the company delivered results ahead of market expectations. From a sector perspective, communication services also managed a positive Q3 (2%), riding the ongoing wave of positive mega-cap stocks’ performance, like Alphabet.”\n\nLike Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet is also a hedge fund favorite when it comes to AI investing.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Hedge Funds 10 AI Stocks Billionaires Are Crazy About Jim Cramer’s 10 Best AI Stocks\n\nDisclosure.None. 10 Best AI Stocks for 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "14 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the14 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable.\n\nThe AI boom that started with the launch of ChatGPT caused almost every tech company to launch (or at least talk about) AI-related products and services. While major mega-cap tech stocks which were positioned well to take advantage of the AI-led rally saw huge gains in 2023, analysts believe in 2024 it's time for the pick-and-shovel names to pack gains as companies begin to actually implement AI-related technologies in their products. Market analysts believe this year we would see gains broadening out to other technology companies instead of just getting concentrated in a few names like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nMagnificent Seven: A Crowded Trade\n\nJPMorgan in January, however, said in a report that the \"strong\" are expected to keep getting \"stronger\" without a solid reversal.\n\n\"The percent of market cap that the “Magnificent 7” represent is at an all-time high, and they accounted for most of the equity market gains in 2023. Another sign of concentration: last year also saw the second highest percentage of S&P 500 stocks underperforming the index since 1980 (72% underperformed vs 52% average). But without judicial brakes on them, the strong are getting stronger and I see little reason, other than valuations that become too high relative to the market, that this should change. On this latter point, see the bottom chart. While megacap stocks look increasingly expensive relative to the market, after adjusting for their higher earnings growth expectations they don’t look nearly as overpriced. The challenge: as shown in the last chart, everyone seems to agree; this is a very crowded trade.\"\n\nWhile mega-cap tech stocks could keep getting stronger in 2024, as JPMorgan said, these \"crowded\" trades have matured and many analysts are now recommending little-known companies with growth potential. Many analysts have also started to see signs of a major rotation where investors are taking profits from big stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) and investing in other companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at some high-growth profitable NASDAQ stocks that are also gaining the attention of hedge fund investors. High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nPhoto by Chris Liverani on Unsplash Methodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to list down all profitable NASDAQ stocks and then picked 14 of these stocks with the highest revenue growth seen recently on a quarter-over-quarter basis and over the past five years. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n14.

(NASDAQ:SHLS), meanwhile, saw headwinds from destocking in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. demand could slow further due to new net metering rules that reduce the value to consumers from sending excess residential solar energy back to the grid. SolarEdge, which makes inverters for solar systems as well as residential and commercial battery systems, is also facing rising battery competition in the U.S. from Tesla.”\n\n12.

We also added Shockwave Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWAV), a medical devices company that uses intravascular lithotripsy technology for treating calcified plaque in patients suffering from coronary diseases. The company is well positioned and continues to expand their product offerings. It appears the stock has been caught up in the market’s medical technology unwind.”\n\n10. Celsius Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CELH) ranks 10th in our list of the best high-growth NASDAQ stocks to invest in according to smart money investors.

(NASDAQ:CELH) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) – Doubted Champion) is the owner of the Celsius brand of energy drinks. Celsius has been a day 1 holding of the partnership and through organic appreciation, coupled with our significant reduction of Basic-Fit shares at the beginning of the third quarter (discussed in the second quarter letter), has grown to become the number 2 position over the last six months. Despite a tremendous runup in shares over the past several years, we think Celsius remains underappreciated and undervalued.\n\nBased on latest scanner data, Celsius holds a roughly 6% share of the U.S. energy market over the last twelve months, making it #3 behind Monster and Red Bull. We believe Celsius can continue to grow and become a significantly larger business for several key reasons… a. Celsius holds a 20%+ share on Amazon and major Florida markets (Miami, Orlando, and Tampa), its most mature markets, and nearly 20% share in New York and Boston. These analogues provide solid evidence that Celsius is capable of being significantly larger than it is today…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n9.

First Citizens BancShares Inc (Delaware) Class A (NASDAQ:FCNCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nFirst Citizens BancShares Inc (Delaware) Class A (NASDAQ:FCNCA) revenue in the third quarter increased by about 111% year over year.

(NASDAQ:FCNCA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s largest position is First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) (“First Citizens” or “FCNCA”). We acquired our stake over the past three years. Initially, we owned and traded around a small position in CIT Group Inc. (“CIT”) during the summer of 2020. We felt CIT was undervalued and management was making progress in reducing risk during the Covid-19 pandemic. In late 2020, CIT agreed to be acquired by First Citizens. We added to our CIT stake the morning of the acquisition announcement because we thought the acquisition was so financially attractive that First Citizens’ shares would rally and pull CIT’s shares higher. Our CIT shares were exchanged for First Citizens shares when the merger completed. We held onto our First Citizens shares because we admired the management team, we felt the bank was undervalued, and we projected the bank would benefit from higher interest rates. Then, earlier this year, First Citizens was the winning bidder in the FDIC’s auction of the failed Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). We added significantly to the Fund’s First Citizens position on the following Monday morning because the deal was unbelievably favorable for First Citizens.\n\nFirst Citizens’s stock price rose more than 50% that day and has risen another 40% in the months since the SVB acquisition. We have not sold any shares. We believe the stock still has the potential to double over the next three years. Despite this attractive upside, we think the downside is minimal. Our downside scenario is an unchanged stock price in three years…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy 12 High Growth International Stocks to Buy 13 High Growth Healthcare Stocks to Buy\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "1 Tech Stock to Buy for 2024, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Last year, tech stocks largely rebounded after the challenges of 2022, as evidenced by the fact that the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperformed the two other major U.S. stock market indexes. Naturally, many tech stocks performed in line -- or even better -- than the Nasdaq, but others weren't so lucky.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) was one of those that did well, while the online learning specialist Chegg(NYSE: CHGG) wasn't so fortunate in 2023. Investors should expect more of the same for these companies this year, which is why Alphabet looks like a solid buy and Chegg is best left alone. GOOG Chart\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet faced several issues entering 2023. First, the advertising market -- where it makes most of its money -- was struggling. Second, the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's attempt to challenge Google's dominance in online search by creating an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Bing put downward pressure on Alphabet's stock price. However, the tech giant was able to handle these issues.\n\nAs the year went by, the advertising space started rebounding, as did Alphabet's revenue growth rates. Further, Microsoft's ChatGPT-powered Bing did little to disrupt Google's empire. Alphabet should maintain much of that momentum in 2024. Analysts predict that the advertising market will rebound even faster this year, which should help propel the company's revenue even higher.\n\nBeyond this year, Alphabet boasts several important long-term growth opportunities. The first is in streaming through its video-sharing platform, YouTube. Streaming has gained significant ground on cable in recent years. And as the shift continues, companies like Alphabet will benefit. Second, Alphabet is a leader in cloud computing, another high-growth industry.\n\nThird, the tech giant is no stranger to the world of AI. Alphabet has used AI for years, notably in its various Google updates. It released a ChatGPT competitor named Bard last year. The fact that it could do so relatively quickly speaks volumes about Alphabet's abilities in this field. Further, the company benefits from a strong competitive advantage from multiple sources.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and some of its platforms, including YouTube and Google, display the network effect. So, even beyond this year, Alphabet can continue to deliver market-beating returns for a long time, which makes it a stop tech stock to buy today.\n\nThe case against Chegg\n\nChegg's business is struggling due to the rise of generative AI applications like ChatGPT. The company offers various forms of help to students, including homework solutions, textbook solutions, and more. However, ChatGPT can perform a lot of those tasks and does so in mere seconds. That's why Chegg's stock dropped like a rock early last year, and it hasn't even come close to recovering fully.\n\nChegg does have a solution to this problem, namely an AI-powered (specifically, GPT-4) study helper called CheggMate, an early version of which became available to students in May 2023. As the company argued, a survey it conducted found that most students wanted a mix of help from AI and actual human experts. So, CheggMate could be the solution to Chegg's problems, but the market isn't sold yet -- and with good reason.\n\nIt's hard to say whether CheggMate will be successful enough to fend off the threat from generative AI or whether Chegg's subscription and sales will stall or perhaps even decrease from here on out. In the third quarter, Chegg's revenue decreased by 4% year over year to $157.9 million. It ended the period with 4.4 million subscribers, a decrease of 8% compared to the year-ago period.\n\nThat was not due entirely, or perhaps even primarily, to AI. Chegg has been struggling to keep subscribers since the worst of the pandemic ended -- its service became highly popular in the early days of the outbreak. Still, that problem, coupled with the AI challenge, does not bode well for Chegg's future, so it's best to avoid the stock for now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "ChatGPT replicates New York Times articles nearly verbatim, a lawsuit by the newspaper claims. But OpenAI and other AI companies say what they do is legally fair use. (Richard Drew / Associated Press)\n\nThis time in 2023, the world was in thrall to the rise of OpenAI’s dazzling chatbot. ChatGPT was metastasizing like a fungal infection, amassing tens of millions of users a month. Multibillion-dollar partnerships materialized, and investments poured in. Big Tech joined the party. AI image generators like Midjourney took flight.\n\nJust a year later, the mood has darkened. The surprise sacking and rapid reinstatement of OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman gave the company an embarrassing emperor-has-no-clothes moment. Profits are scarce across the sector, and computing costs are sky high. But one issue looms large above all and threatens to bring the fledgling industry back to earth: Copyright.\n\nRead more:Column: OpenAI's board had safety concerns. Big Tech obliterated them in 48 hours\n\nThe legal complaints that cropped up throughout last year have grown into a thundering chorus, and the tech companies say they now present an existential threat to generative AI (the kind that can produce writing, pictures, music and so on). If 2023 was the year the world marveled at AI content generators, 2024 may be the year that the humans who created the raw materials that made that content possible get their revenge — and maybe even claw back some of the value built on their work.\n\nIn the last days of December, the New York Times filed a bombshell lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging that “millions of its articles were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.” The Times’ lawsuit joins a host of others — class-action lawsuits filed by illustrators, by the photo service Getty Images, by George R.R. Martin and the Author’s Guild, by anonymous social media users, to name a few — all alleging that companies that stand to profit from generative AI used the work of writers, reporters, artists and others without consent or compensation, infringing on their copyrights in the process.\n\nStory continues\n\nEach of these lawsuits have their merits, but the Gray Lady’s entrance into the arena changes the game. For one thing, the Times is influential in shaping national narratives. For another, the Times lawsuit is uniquely damning; it’s loaded with example after example of how ChatGPT replicates news articles nearly verbatim, and offers the responses to its paying customers, free of attribution.\n\nIt’s not just the lawsuits: The heat is getting turned up by Congress, researchers and AI experts too. On Wednesday, a congressional hearing saw senators and media industry representatives agree that AI companies should pay licensing fees for the material they use to train their models. “It’s not only morally right,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D.-Conn.), who chairs the subcommittee that held the hearing, according to Wired. “It’s legally required.”\n\nMeanwhile, a fiery study recently published in IEEE Spectrum, co-written by the cognitive scientist and AI expert Gary Marcus and the film industry veteran Reid Southern, shows that Midjourney and Dall-E, two of the leading AI image generators, were trained on copyrighted material, and can regurgitate that material at will — often without even being prompted to.\n\n“Our experiments make it all but certain that these systems are in fact training on copyrighted material,” Marcus told me, something that the companies have been coy about copping to explicitly. “The companies have been far from straightforward in what they’re using, so it was important to establish that they are using copyrighted materials.” Also important: that the copyright-infringing works come spilling out of the systems with little prodding. “You don’t need to prompt it, to say ‘make C3P0’ — you can just say ‘draw golden droid.’ Or ‘Italian plumber’ — it will just draw Mario.”\n\nThis has serious implications for anyone using the systems in a commercial capacity. “The companies whose properties are infringed — Mattel, Nintendo — are going to take an interest in this,” Marcus says. “But the user is left vulnerable too — There’s nothing in the output that says what the sources are. In fact the software isn’t capable of doing that in a reliable way. So the users are on the hook and have no clue as to whether it’s infringing or not.”\n\nThere’s also a sense of momentum that’s beginning to build behind the simple notion that creators should be compensated for work that’s being used by AI companies valued at billions or tens of billions — or hundreds of billions of dollars, as Google and Microsoft are. The notion that generative AI systems are at root “plagiarism machines” has become increasingly widespread among their critics, and social media is teeming with opprobrium against AI.\n\nRead more:Column: Hollywood is on strike because CEOs fell for Silicon Valley's magical thinking\n\nBut those AI companies aren’t likely to relent. We saw a foreshadowing of how the AI companies would respond to copyright concerns at large last year, when famed venture capitalist and AI evangelist Marc Andreessen’s firm argued that AI companies would go broke if they had to pay copyright royalties or licensing fees. Just this week, British media outlets reported that OpenAI has made the same case, seeking an exemption from copyright rules in England, claiming that the company simply couldn’t operate without ingesting copyrighted materials.\n\n“Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression — including blogposts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents — it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials,” OpenAI argued in its submission to the House of Lords. Note that both Andreessen and OpenAI’s statements underscore the value of copyrighted work in arguing that AI companies shouldn't have to pay for it.\n\nWhat can they do about it?\n\nFirst, they’re pleading poverty. There’s just too much material out there to compensate everyone who contributed to making their system work and to making their valuation go through the roof. “Poor little rich company that’s valued at $100 billion can’t afford it,” Marcus says. “I don’t know how well that’s going to wash, but that’s what they’re arguing.”\n\nThe AI companies also argue what they're doing falls under the legal doctrine of fair use — probably the strongest argument they’ve got — because it’s transformative. This argument helped Google win in court against the big book publishers when it was copying books into its massive Google Books database, and defeat claims that YouTube was profiting by allowing users to host and promulgate unlicensed material.\n\nNext, the AI companies argue that copyright-violating outputs like those uncovered by Marcus, Southern and the New York Times are rare or are bugs that are going to be patched.\n\n“They say, ‘Well this doesn’t happen very much. You need to do special prompting.’ But the things we asked it were pretty neutral — and we still got\" copyrighted material, Marcus says. “This is not a minor side issue — this is how the systems are built. It is existential for these companies to be able to use this amount of data.”\n\nFinally, aside from just making arguments in court and in statements, the AI companies are going to use their ample resources to lobby behind the scenes and throw their power around to help make their case.\n\nAgain, the generative AI industry isn’t making much money yet — last year was essentially one massive product demo to hype up the technology. And it worked: The investment dollars did pour in. But that doesn’t mean the AI companies have figured out ways to build a sustainable business model. They’re already operating under the assumption that they will not pay for things such as training materials, licenses or artists’ labor.\n\nOf course, it is in no way true that the likes of Google, Microsoft, or even OpenAI cannot afford to pay to use copyrighted works — but Silicon Valley is at this point used to cutting labor and the cost of creative works out of the equation, and has little reason to think it would not be able to do so again. From Uber to Spotify, the business models of many of this century’s biggest tech companies have been built on the assumption that labor costs could be cut out or minimized. And when creative industries argued that YouTube allowed pirated and unlicensed materials to proliferate at the workers’ expense, and backed the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) to fight it, Google was instrumental in stopping the bill, organizing rallies and online campaigns, and lobbying lawmakers to jump ship.\n\nWilliam Fitzgerald, a partner at the Worker Agency and former member of the public policy team at Google, tells me he sees a similar pressure campaign taking shape to fight the copyright cases, one modeled on the playbook Google has used successfully in the past: Marshaling third-party groups and organs such as the Chamber of Progress to push the idea that using copyrighted works for generative AI is not just fair use, but something that’s being embraced by artists themselves, not all of whom are so hung up on things like wanting to be paid for their work. He points to a pro-generative AI open letter signed by AI artists, that was, according to one of the artists involved, organized by Derek Slater, a former Google policy director whose firm works with Google — the same person who took credit for organizing the anti-SOPA efforts. Fitzgerald also sees Google’s fingerprints on Creative Commons’ embrace of the argument that AI art is fair use, as Google is a major funder of the organization.\n\n“It’s worrisome to see Google deploy the same lobbying tactics they’ve developed over the years to ensure workers don’t get paid fairly for their labor,” Fitzgerald said. And OpenAI is close behind. It is not only taking a similar approach to heading off copyright complaints as Google, but it’s also hiring the same people: It hired Fred Von Lohmann, Google’s former director of copyright policy, as its top copyright lawyer.\n\n“It appears OpenAI is replicating Google’s lobbying playbook,” he says. “They’ve hired former Google advocates to affect the same playbook that’s been so successful for Google for decades now.”\n\nThings are different this time, however. There was real grassroots animosity against SOPA, which was seen at the time as engineered by Hollywood and the music industry; Silicon Valley was still widely beloved as a benevolent inventor of the future, and many didn’t see how having an artist's work uploaded to a video platform owned by the good guys on the internet might be detrimental to their economic interests. (Though many did!)\n\nNow, however, workers in the digital world are better prepared. Everyone from Hollywood screenwriters to freelance illustrators to part-time copywriters to full-time coders can recognize the potential material effect of a generative AI system that can ingest their work, replicate it, and offer it to users for a monthly fee — paid to a Silicon Valley corporation, not them.\n\nRead more:Column: The writers' strike was the first workplace battle between humans and AI. The humans won\n\n“It’s asking for an enormous giveaway,” Marcus says. “It’s the equivalent of a major land grab.”\n\nNow, there are many in Silicon Valley who are of course genuinely excited about the potential of AI, and many others who are genuinely oblivious to matters of political economy; who want to see the gains made as quickly as possible, and do not realize how these work-automating systems will be used in practice. Others may simply not care. But for those who do, Marcus says there’s a simple way forward.\n\n“There’s an obvious alternative here — OpenAI’s saying that we need all this or we can’t build AI — but they could pay for it!” We want a world with artists and with writers, after all, he adds, one that rewards artistic work — not one where all the money goes to the top because a handful of tech companies won a digital land grab.\n\n“It’s up to workers everywhere to see this for what it is, get organized, educate lawmakers and fight to get paid fairly for their labor,” Fitzgerald says. “Because if they don’t, Google and OpenAI will continue to profit from other people’s labor and content for a long time to come.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Bill Ackman Has 34% of His Portfolio Invested in 2 Brilliant Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Bill Ackman runs Pershing Square Capital Management. He is perhaps best known for a disastrous short position in Herbalife, a nutrition company he called a pyramid scheme. Ackman made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife in 2012, expecting the stock to go to zero, but it had doubled by the time he exited the position in 2018.\n\nHowever, Ackman has made some excellent moves in the market as well. Indeed, his hedge fund returned 288% over the past five years, easily topping the S&P 500's 107% gain. That outperformance makes Ackman an investor worth studying.\n\nWith that in mind, 34% of his Pershing Square portfolio was invested in two companies as of the quarter ended last September: 17% was allocated to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and another 17% was invested in Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Ackman is clearly signaling high conviction in these businesses.\n\nHere's why both stocks could be brilliant investments.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet subsidiary Google is essentially the on-ramp to the internet. The company owns six products that reach more than 2 billion users, including the leading internet search engine (Google Search), the most popular web browser (Chrome), and the top streaming platform as measured by viewing time (YouTube). To that end, Google can engage consumers and source data from across the internet unlike any other company.\n\nThat advantage is especially formidable when coupled with its expertise in artificial intelligence and analytics. In short, Google has the web platforms, behavioral data, and technical know-how to reach consumers with relevant ads, and that has naturally translated into adtech leadership. Google captured 39% of global digital advertising revenue in 2023, according to Statista.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has steadily gained share in cloud computing due to sensible investments in product development and go-to-market capabilities. Google Cloud Platform accounted for 11% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the third quarter, up 400 basis points in the last three years. To be clear, the company still trails Amazon and Microsoft by a wide margin, but its progress is encouraging. Moreover, Google is well positioned to continue gaining market share given its leadership in artificial intelligence infrastructure and nascent opportunities with generative AI products like Gemini.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet reported fairly good financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 11% year over year to $76.7 billion and GAAP net income climbed 42% to $19.7 billion. The only disappointment was a lackluster performance in Google Cloud, likely because businesses have been scrutinizing IT budgets more closely in response to economic uncertainty. But investors should look past these transient headwinds.\n\nOn that note, digital ad spending is forecast to increase by nearly 10% annually through 2032, and the cloud computing market is expected to expand by 17% annually during the same period. That gives Alphabet a good shot at annual sales growth in the low teens through the end of the decade.\n\nIn that context, its current valuation of 6.2 times sales looks reasonable, especially when the three-year average is 6.4 times sales. Patient investors can confidently buy a small position in this growth stock today.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle operates more than 3,300 fast-casual dining locations. The company has a durable economic moat built on its commitment to \"food with integrity.\" Chipotle sources only responsibly raised meats (no hormones or antibiotics) and organically grown produce, and it uses only real ingredients (no preservatives or artificial flavors).\n\nThe company is also committed to fresh ingredients. That means no freezers, no can openers, and no microwaves, according to CEO Brian Niccol. The upshot of that strategy is that many consumers view Chipotle as a healthier, tastier option than other quick-service restaurants. In turn, the company regularly generates traffic and same-store sales growth that exceed the industry average.\n\nChipotle reported strong financial results in the third quarter, meeting expectations on the top line while beating on the bottom line. Revenue rose 11% to $2.5 billion, driven by same-store sales growth of 5% that management attributed to more transactions and pricing power. Additionally, GAAP net income climbed 23% to $11.32 per diluted share, outpacing revenue due to stock buybacks and a 90-basis-point expansion in operating margin.\n\nManagement also provided encouraging updates on the earnings call. Niccol said staffing and turnover are back to (or better than) pre-pandemic levels, and he mentioned progress in boosting throughput, meaning lines are moving more quickly. Niccol also noted more timely and accurate digital orders. Those updates point to an improving customer experience.\n\nLooking ahead, Chipotle plans to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year, up from 255 to 285 last year, and the company hopes to increase its footprint by 10% in 2025. That sets the stage for solid growth in the years ahead. Indeed, the Wall Street consensus calls for earnings per share to increase by 23% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nIn that context, Chipotle's current valuation of 54 times earnings still looks a bit pricey, but investors should remember that premium gets them into a best-in-class company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "SANTIAGO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The Chilean government announced a partnership with Alphabet's Google on Wednesday to build the first undersea fiber-optic cable between South America and Asia Pacific.\n\nThe Humboldt Cable Project will connect Chile's port city of Valparaiso with Sydney, Australia through 14,800 kilometers (9,200 miles) of fiber-optic cable with a capacity of 144 terabytes and a 25-year lifespan, according to a government press release.\n\n\"This cable will consolidate Chile's position as the center of digital activity in South America,\" President Gabriel Boric said during a press conference in Valparaiso.\n\nHe added that the project would \"open opportunities for new industries, jobs and better work and life conditions for thousands of people.\"\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when China and the United States have been battling for economic and political influence in Latin America, with undersea cables being central the technology competition.\n\nA Reuters investigation found that various undersea fiber-optic cable projects to Asia, including two in which Google was an investor, were originally supposed to link to China but were thwarted or re-routed due to U.S. diplomatic pressure.\n\nAside from technology competition, U.S. authorities worried about the possibility of spy agencies intercepting data on the planned undersea cables.\n\nChina President Xi Jingping touted his country's strong ties with Chile during a diplomatic visit last October, while U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to strengthen economic ties with Latin America to counter China's growing influence.

        "content": "The integration of generative AI in smartphones is expected to spur “a new upgrade cycle” in 2024 after years of sluggish sales, according to Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon.\n\nSpeaking at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Amon painted an optimistic outlook for the handset market, despite global smartphone sales hitting the lowest level in nearly a decade in 2023, according to data from Counterpoint Research.\n\n“We’re starting to see as early as 2024 some very interesting use cases, even with flagship [smartphones],” Amon said about the role of artificial intelligence. “That could create a new upgrade cycle for phones, and that will, by definition, just increase the phone market.” Cristiano Amon, president and CEO of Qualcomm Incorporated, speaks during a Sony news conference before the start of the CES tech show on Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2023, in Las Vegas. (John Locher/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSmartphone correction 'is behind us'\n\nA macroeconomic slowdown, component shortages, inventory build-up, and longer replacement cycles have all contributed to a global downturn in smartphones for more than two years.\n\nWhile shipments bounced back in the last two quarters of 2023, annual sales dipped 3.5% from the previous year, according to IDC forecasts. That decline has been even more pronounced in the North American market, where the region recorded its worst quarterly performance in more than a decade in Q2 of last year, according to Canalys.\n\nThat sluggish demand has created major headwinds for Qualcomm, the largest chipmaker for handsets. The company reported a 24% decline in revenue in Q4 compared to the same period the previous year.\n\nBut Amon said new AI devices are likely to swing the pendulum back to growth.\n\n“Most of that correction and the inventory in the channel is behind us right now, at least on the Android market,” he said.\n\nWhile the use of generative AI has largely been limited to the cloud until now, device and chipmakers have touted the shift to devices as a “game changer,” leading to low latency, more personalized experiences, and enhanced security.\n\nEarly estimates back Amon’s comments. Shipments for generative AI smartphones are expected to reach over 100 million units in 2024, according to preliminary data from Counterpoint Research. That number is expected to reach 1 billion by 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsung has already hinted that it will unveil its Galaxy AI phone at its Unpacked event next week, while Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has already incorporated its Gemini generative AI model into the Pixel 8 Pro. Apple has also reportedly been developing its own large language model to integrate into devices.\n\nEven with that potential, Qualcomm has looked to diversify its resources beyond mobile under Amon, with a big push into auto chips.\n\nThe company has already reported a pipeline of more than $30 billion in design wins for its digital chassis platform. Amon said Qualcomm is ahead of its own projections to hit $9 billion in revenue by the end of the decade.\n\n“There's so much excitement,” Amon said. “So many developers are bringing new applications. The car is going to be the next computing platform like your phone, like your PC. We're going to see a lot of use cases.”\n\nRead more coverage from CES 2024:\n\nNvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power gaming and AI efforts at CES 2024 AMD debuts AI-focused Ryzen 8000G desktop chips at CES 2024 Microsoft is adding an AI button to PC keyboards, their first major change in 30 years From AI to flying cars, here’s what to expect at CES 2024\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- What’s the most important price in the global economy? The price of oil? The price of semiconductors? The price of a Big Mac? More important than any of these is the price of money. For more than three decades it was falling, but now it’s set to rise. In the mini-documentary The Rising Cost of Money, Bloomberg Originals explains why this is happening—and what it means for you.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGoogle Lays Off Hundreds in Hardware, Assistant, Engineering UK’s Sunak Authorizes Joint Military Strikes With US Against Houthis SEC Authorizes Bitcoin-Spot ETFs in Crypto’s Breakthrough Hertz to Sell 20,000 EVs in Shift Back to Gas-Powered Cars US and Allies Launch Airstrikes on Houthi Targets in Yemen\n\nAsk most people how the price of money is set, and they’ll say via interest rates determined by central banks like the US Federal Reserve. In fact, there’s a deeper logic at work. Fundamentally, the price of money (like the price of anything else) reflects the balance of supply and demand. A higher supply of savings pushes rates down. More investment demand pushes them up.\n\nFor the economics wonks, the price of money that balances saving and investment while keeping inflation stable has another name—the “natural rate of interest.” For more than three decades, this rate was trending down. By Bloomberg Economics’ estimates, and adjusting for inflation, the natural rate of interest for 10-year US government bonds fell from a little more than 5% in 1980 to a little less than 2% over the past decade.\n\nIn The Rising Cost of Money, we explain what drove the rate lower, what’s about to reverse its decline and what that means for everything from home prices to the stock market and the sustainability of US government debt.\n\nTo see more Bloomberg Originals video documentaries, click here.To subscribe to the Bloomberg Originals YouTube channel, click here.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg’s Top Priority Trumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election US Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China’s War Machine Five ETFs to Watch in 2024 Kim Kardashian’s Skims Isn’t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "15 States With Highest Rates of Eating Disorders",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 15 states with the highest rates of eating disorders. If you want to skip our discussion of eating disorders, their causes, and their effects on American society, you can go directly to the 5 States With Highest Rates of Eating Disorders.\n\nEating disorders are a group of illnesses that affect a person's relationship with food and body image. They are primarily mental illnesses that have been recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) since the 1980s. The current edition of DSM recognizes eight categories of eating disorders. If you were wondering which mental illness has the highest mortality rate, it is Anorexia Nervosa. The disease causes a strong fear of gaining weight, and its patients resort to extreme exercise and calorie limitations. On the other hand, binge eating, which leads to several other diseases such as obesity and heart attack, also causes significant mortality indirectly.\n\nA significant portion of America has an eating disorder. According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, almost 30 million Americans live with an eating disorder. If you live in America, there is a 9% chance that you will develop an eating disorder in your lifetime. However, this illness disproportionately affects women as they are twice as likely to develop an eating disorder compared to men. In fact, eating disorders are the third most common chronic illness in adolescent females.\n\nInsurance data depicts an alarming situation regarding eating disorders. There has been a significant increase as the share of claim lines related to eating disorders among all claims increased by 65% between the years 2018 and 2022. However, it is worth noting that the majority of eating disorder claim lines as a percentage of total claim lines increased in the first year of the pandemic (2019 - 2020), during which it rose by 39%.\n\nThe worsening of America's eating disorder crisis during post-pandemic has triggered several state laws aimed at tackling the surge. Lawmakers across the country are proposing restrictions on social media algorithms to prevent them from promoting harmful content. These laws are specifically proposed to counteract anorexia, which according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, claims 10,000 lives every year. The proposed restrictions also include preventing the sale of weight loss pills to minors. Other proposals include adding eating disorder prevention into the school curriculum.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile anorexia is one of the most common eating disorders and claims the most lives, disorders such as binge eating and emotional eating are also a serious concern. The mortality rate of these disorders gets underreported as most of the time they contribute indirectly to death. Binge eating for several years, for example, can lead to cardiovascular disease, which is also a result of several other factors, such as lack of mobility and exercise.\n\nThe popularity and prevalence of fast food may be contributing to the eating disorder crisis in the country. Research has shown a positive correlation between fast-food consumption and eating disorder risk in teenagers. America has a thriving fast-food culture and is home to some of the most popular fast-food chains in the world. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the largest fast-food chains. The restaurant chain has the highest number of franchises in the world. Up until recently, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was also the leading fast-food chain in terms of revenue, a title which now belongs to Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), another American fast-food company. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), the largest fast food company in terms of revenue, earned $32.9 billion during 2022. For comparison, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)'s revenue for the same year was $23.18 billion. With America's thriving fast-food culture, both companies have a positive outlook. Here is what RiverPark Advisors, an investment advisory firm and sponsor of the RiverPark family of mutual funds, said about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX): SBUX is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 83 markets. Through its more than 36,000 global stores (roughly 50% operated and 50% licensed) the company offers handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of food items. SBUX also sells a variety of packaged coffee and tea products and licenses its trademarks through other channels such as grocery and foodservice through a Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé. In addition to its flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, the company sells goods and services under the brands Teavana, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Ethos, Starbucks Reserve and Princi.\n\nSBUX’s recently appointed CEO (March 2023), Narasimhan Laxman, reiterated the company’s long-term plans for 10-12% revenue growth and 15-20% EPS growth while reporting fiscal 3Q23 earnings. Revenue will be driven by a combination of factors including unit growth, higher food “attach” rates (more food sold per cup of coffee), equipment innovation to speed throughput, and delivery expansion. In addition to the leverage of higher revenue across the company’s fixed asset base, SBUX sees margin expansion from supply chain management opportunities and procurement efficiencies. We initiated a small position in August.\"\n\nThe rise of eating disorders in the country has paved the way for many treatment centers. In addition, psychiatrists also prescribe certain pharmaceuticals to help deal with life-threatening eating disorders. Most psychiatrists, for example, prescribe Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)'s Prozac, a brand name for Fluoxetine. The drug is a commonly prescribed antidepressant, which is also beneficial for people with anorexia. Prozac was introduced by Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in 1986 as a treatment for several psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, eventually, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)'s Prozac was found to be beneficial for several eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at 15 states with the highest rates of eating disorders. 15 States With Highest Rates of Eating Disorders\n\nmichaelheim/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of 15 states with the highest rates of eating disorders, we relied on data from Google Trends. Accurate state-wise data regarding people suffering from eating disorders was not available, so we had to rely on the general search interest in each state. Our rationale for this was that the higher the rates of eating disorders, the more popular its related search terms would be. We looked at Google Trends for search popularity of the five most common eating disorders in each state in 2023. Google Trends has an arbitrary rating out of 100 - the higher the rating, the more popular the search term. For each state, we totaled the rating for the five eating disorders and divided it by 5 to arrive at our own eating disorder score. The higher the score, the higher the rates of eating disorders in the state. The eating disorders we considered for our research were: anorexia, bigorexia, binge eating, body dysmorphia, and emotional eating.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "title": "Amazon layoffs show Big Tech is still coming down from pandemic highs",
        "content": "The COVID-era spending spree is over. And the tech layoffs keep coming.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is eliminating several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios, according to a memo sent to staff on Wednesday. And the company's video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, announced it is laying off more than 500 people.\n\nThat Amazon is ringing in the new year with another round of cuts highlights the tech sector's climb down from COVID-era expansion. Even as confidence grows on Wall Street that the economy will finally break free from fears of a recession, tech companies are still reeling from heady staffing days and ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nDuring the acute phase of the public health crisis, company ranks swelled alongside aspirations of rapid growth and a tech-centric transformation. Many executives and market observers believed new consumer habits would redefine the trends to come and accelerate changes already on the way. Screen time exploded as social lives shrunk and adapted. But the spike in demand for e-commerce and digital services eventually leveled off, leaving executives with what they claimed were bloated teams and inefficiency. A brutal wave of job cuts was their answer.\n\n\"A lot of companies in various sectors of the economy had rapid expansion during the 'stay at home economy,'\" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \"Amazon is taking steps to narrow the gap between employee headcount and the growth of its business.\"\n\nAmazon was arguably the darling of the pandemic era as it benefited from consumers’ sudden shift to online shopping and businesses’ broad move to the cloud, said Nicole Tanenbaum, partner and chief investment strategist at Chequers Financial Management. During this period, Amazon’s profitability soared while the company boosted staffing and leaned into expanded offerings and markets. Amazon’s headcount grew by 310,000 from 2020 to 2021, an increase of almost 25%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as the disruptions of the pandemic eased into a recovering economy,the company’s prior investment decisions collided with slowing revenue growth, a reset in consumer spending patterns, and increasing cost pressures triggered by historic inflation.\n\nAmazon also faced a major leadership transition. Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, whose identity is intimately tied to the company, stepped aside as CEO in 2021. Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon’s lucrative and industry-leading cloud service, AWS, then took the reins.\n\n“Not only does Jassy take a much more direct approach with regards to regulatory and political issues, he has not been afraid to admit that the company overbuilt and needed to reset its approach, lasering in on efforts to control margins and operations in the face of significant inflationary pressures,” Tanenbaum said. Amazon is cutting several hundred positions across its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFor Jassy and Amazon, rightsizing the business arrived in the form of substantial cost-cutting initiatives. The company enacted stark headcount reductions along with a hiring freeze to further control costs.\n\nAmazon's layoffs over the last several years amount to more than 27,000 cuts. The latest round underscores the financial pullback, especially in contrast to massive spending during peak COVID. For instance,Amazon spent $8.5 billion to acquire MGM, the home of James Bond, in 2022. And the company is estimated to have doled out more than $1 billion to produce multiple seasons of The Rings of Power, its Lord of the Rings prequel series, and likely the most expensive show ever.\n\nWhile Amazon is among the largest private employers in the US, and the biggest within the tech world, several of its industry peers have turned to drastic layoffs. Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, dubbed 2023 the \"year of efficiency.\" The social media company cut more than 20,000 jobs since late 2022 to cope with declining ad revenue and to improve the business and its cost structure.\n\nAnd Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which has cut more than 10,000 jobs in that period, said on Thursday it is laying off hundreds of workers on its digital assistant, hardware, and engineering teams, as the search giant aims to trim costs and focus on its biggest priorities.\n\nThere is a chance Big Tech will bolster its ranks if the Fed starts to cut rates later this year, relaxing the more reserved posture the industry has adopted. But what’s happening now to staff levels suggests otherwise, said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. After peaking in the spring of 2022, tech industry headcounts suffered a significant decline through the summer of last year. Those losses eventually flattened out and leveled off, a trend that’s likely to continue, as exuberance gives way to caution.\n\nThe digital lives of consumers changed during the pandemic — that's undeniable. But they continue to change, along with the next chapter of the US economy.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Further, Google launched YouTube Create, a mobile app designed to streamline video production for creators, offering AI-enabled editing, captioning, voiceover, filters and royalty-free music features.\r\n\r\nAlphabet introduced a Pause option for YouTube Creators, preventing new video-level comments while preserving existing ones. This feature is available in video-level comment settings on the YouTube app’s watch page and YouTube Studio.\r\n\r\nThe company is also testing a new feature that allows views and like counts to update in real-time while a viewer watches a video. This feature updates the figures every minute, though it becomes harder to see as counts increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nMove to Benefit\n\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors will strengthen YouTube’s subscriber base, which, in turn, will solidify Alphabet’s footing in the global video streaming space, presenting a significant growth opportunity for the company.\r\n\r\nPer a Fortune Business Insights report, the video streaming market is expected to reach $1.9 trillion by 2030, witnessing a CAGR of 19.3% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a strong YouTube subscriber base will, in turn, aid Alphabet in strengthening its Google Services segment, which has been the key growth driver of the company.

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee\n\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google Cloud said on Thursday its customers who want to migrate their data to another cloud provider will not have to pay any network fees to make the transfer.\n\nMany cloud providers, including Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS), charge customers based on the amount of data transferred when they switch vendors.\n\nBritain's media regulator Ofcom in October raised concerns about the fees, saying it can discourage customers from switching to an alternative provider. Ofcom had earlier asked the country's antitrust authority to investigate tech giants' dominance of the UK cloud market.\n\nAlthough eliminating data transfer fees will make it easier for customers to change their cloud provider, restrictive and unfair licensing practices are why many customers do not switch, Amit Zavery, head of platform at Google Cloud wrote in a blog post.\n\n\"Making it easier for customers to move from one provider to another does little to improve choice if customers remain locked in with restrictive licences,\" he said.\n\nAWS leads the cloud computing market, followed by Azure, and Google is a distant third. Both Google and Amazon had earlier said that Microsoft's terms of services had made it difficult for customers to switch.\n\nRemoval of data transfer fees applies to all customers globally from Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; editing by Barbara Lewis)",

        "content": "Microsoft MSFT and OpenAI, the creator of the popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT, are continuously making significant strides that will further solidify their presence in the global chatbot market. The global chatbot market size is expected to hit $7.01 billion in 2024 and reach $20.8 billion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 24.3% between 2024 and 2029.\r\n\r\nOpenAI has launched the GPT Store to create a marketplace for specialized chatbot agents based on their language models, particularly ChatGPT. This move allows users to buy and sell customized bots beyond what is offered through ChatGPT Plus. Users can develop chatbot agents with unique personalities or themes for various purposes, such as salary negotiation, creating lesson plans and developing recipes.\r\n\r\nThe store was initially scheduled to open in November but faced delays due to internal upheaval at OpenAI, including the firing and subsequent reappointment of CEO Sam Altman. The company plans to launch a revenue-sharing program in the first quarter, where builders will be compensated based on user engagement with their GPTs, although specific details have not been shared yet.\r\n\r\nTo feature in the GPT Store, developers have to verify their user profiles and submit their GPTs to OpenAI’s new review system. This involves a mix of human and automated review to ensure the GPTs comply with the company’s terms of use.\r\n\r\nOpenAI has emphasized the need for users to ensure that their chatbots adhere to usage policies and brand guidelines. The store is accessible to subscribers of premium services, such as ChatGPT Plus, Enterprise and the new subscription tier called Team, which costs $25 per month for each user. Team subscribers can create custom GPTs for their team’s specific needs.\r\n\r\nDuring a demo day for developers, the company has offered to cover legal costs for developers facing potential copyright law issues related to products based on ChatGPT and OpenAI's technology. OpenAI has been sued multiple times for alleged copyright infringement related to the use of copyrighted text in training its language models.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nMSFT Leads the Race for AI Revenues Through OpenAI\n\nMicrosoft, which has gained 15.3% in the past three months, is being propelled by the success of ChatGPT. The launch of enterprise capabilities of Azure OpenAI and Copilots across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform is expected to be a game changer for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $242.41 billion, indicating 14.3% growth from fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings is pinned at $11.14 per share, up 13.5% from the year-ago actual figure.\r\n\r\nThe launch of the GPT store underlines Microsoft and OpenAI’s efforts to rapidly evolve their offerings in an attempt to stay ahead of rivals, such as Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google and Adobe ADBE in the AI arms race. ChatGPT had about 100 million weekly active users as of November, according to OpenAI, and more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies use the platform.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is launching a range of features for Google Bard starting in 2024. The upcoming updates include custom bots, tasks, shared queries, \"Power Ups,\" and a paid \"Advanced\" tier. Further, Google will introduce new sections in Bard, namely Gallery and Tasks, to showcase its capabilities, including image generation and prompt improvement through the \"Power Up\" button.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services, introduced Amazon Q, an AI-powered chatbot that assists in content creation and action-taking based on customer information repositories, code and enterprise systems. Further, Amazon Q streamlines tasks, accelerates decision-making and fosters creativity by providing personalized information and advice tailored to individual user identities, roles and permissions.\r\n\r\nAdobe has announced the commercial release of its family of creative generative AI models, Firefly. Adobe Firefly supports text prompts in more than 100 languages, helps creators make several changes to their content, creates endless variations seamlessly and bolsters image generation capabilities. The company is gaining strong momentum among content creators with Firefly.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Perplexity AI’s challenge to Google hinges on something simple but tough—being the best",
        "content": "There are two major Steve Jobs movies.\n\nI learned this talking to Perplexity AI cofounder and CEO Aravind Srinivas, who wanted to be clear with me—he was talking about the Steve Jobs movie featuring Michael Fassbender, not Ashton Kutcher.\n\nI’d only seen Fassbender’s 2015 take on Jobs, and I should keep it that way, Srinivas told me.\n\n“That’s the good one,” he said. “There’s this scene where Wozniak comes in and says to Jobs: ‘You don’t write any code. You don’t do design.’ Then Jobs says, ‘I play the orchestra.’ And that’s what Perplexity’s like. We don’t train the foundation models. We don’t build the core GPU infrastructure. But we take all that, and play the orchestra.”\n\nAnd Srinivas’ Perplexity AI orchestra has played a promising first movement. The AI search startup last week announced that it had raised $73.6 million in a funding round led by IVP and including Jeff Bezos, NEA, NVIDIA, Databricks, and Bessemer Venture Partners at a $520 million valuation. Like a number of AI startups, Perplexity has managed to raise money in a tough environment. In 2023, $170.6 billion was invested across venture—that marks a decline of $71.6 billion from 2022 totals, and a whopping $177.4 billion drop from 2021, according to PitchBook and NVCA data released Wednesday. Much of 2023’s deal value was bolstered significantly by the $17 billion raised by Open AI and Anthropic combined, a testament to the AI boom’s power.\n\nBut there’s an extra wrinkle to Perplexity’s story. The company is looking to make its mark on the search market, famous for the spectacular dominance of one player: Google. Srinivas says Perplexity will find its place because the company is operating with a fundamentally different business model.\n\n\"Google has no incentive to actually move fast and nail this product experience because their core money is coming from making people click on links and view links,” he told me. “Right now, our core money is coming from being the best.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBenchmarking in AI is difficult, but I will say this: I have found Perplexity to be pretty compelling. I’ve asked specific questions, from “What are some famous IPOs in which the company was not profitable?” to “How many Steve Jobs movies are there?” And I’ve found the answers to be accurate and concise on an interface that’s easy to use. I’m the target customer for Perplexity right now, as the company is currently operating on a subscription business model selling Perplexity Pro for $20 per month or $200 per year to knowledge workers. The free version doesn’t have the image upload or assistant called Copilot, but it is able to take on the same sorts of queries.\n\n\"Our value proposition is that the free product is already so good that you can still use it without having to pay for it, but the paid product is going to be insane,” he said.\n\nSo it’s a business predicated on being the best, which is tough to objectively ascertain and, well, stressful. That got me thinking about another on-screen drama: I recently (finally) watched FX’s The Bear, a TV show that's ostensibly about a fine dining chef, but is really so much more—it’s about the crippling anxiety and inevitable pitfalls that come with wanting to be the absolute best at something. I asked Srinivas if he’d seen The Bear, and he hadn’t. But I told him about something one character says to another, as they talk about her ambition to win a Michelin star: “You’re going to have to care about everything, more than anything.”\n\nI ask him if he agrees. Srinivas sat back, and paused. There was a long beat.\n\n“You have to care about the things that matter.”\n\nI pressed, asking how you can know what matters.\n\n“Part of being a leader is looking at 100 different things, and telling people that these are the three that matter,” Srinivas said. “That’s my job, and if I’m not doing it, I shouldn’t be the CEO anymore,” adding that he thinks often of leaders he admires like Elon Musk—“I know he’s controversial”—and Bezos.\n\nIt’s the sort of reference that speaks to what a big swing Perplexity AI is. It’s hard to believe Google will hold its place at the top of the search heap forever (nothing lasts that long), but it’s also hard to see how they won’t. And Perplexity is also competing with chatbots fielded by heavyweight tech companies like Meta, Amazon, and AI startups like Anthropic and Open AI. I say that this all strikes me as pretty bold.\n\n\"Startups are all about being bold,” Srinivas told me. “Are you building a company that has unbounded potential? That’s risky, but there's an infinite reward if it works.”\n\nI tell him that I’m just not sure how on earth Perplexity finds scale in search. Srinivas takes it in stride.\n\n“You can ask all these questions and I think they’re all fair, pretty rational ways of thinking about it. But startups are for irrational people, right?”\n\nSee you tomorrow,\n\nAllie Garfinkle\r\nTwitter:@agarfinks\r\nEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com\r\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\n\nJoe Abrams curated the deals section of today's newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Google should pay a multibillion fine in antitrust shopping case, an EU court adviser says",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — A legal adviser to the European Union's top court said Thursday that Google should pay a whopping fine in a long-running antitrust case in which regulators found the company gave its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage over rivals in search results.\n\nThe European Court of Justice's advocate general, Juliane Kokott, recommended rejecting the U.S. search giant's appeal of the 2017 penalty. In a legal opinion, Kokott also proposed upholding the 2.4 billion euro ($2.6 billion) fine that the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top competition watchdog, slapped on Google.\n\nThe commission had accused the company of unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-euro fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry.\n\nGoogle appealed to the top EU tribunal after the lower General Court rejected its challenge. Opinions by the Court of Justice's advocate general aren’t legally binding but are often followed by its judges. Their final decision is expected within months.\n\n“Google, as found by the Commission and confirmed by the General Court, was leveraging its dominant position on the market for general search services to favor its own comparison shopping service by favoring the display of its result,” the Court of Justice said in a press summary of the opinion.\n\nThis “self-preferencing” amounts to \"an independent form of abuse” by Google, it said.\n\nGoogle made changes in 2017 to comply with the European Commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. The company started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services.\n\n“We will review the opinion of the Advocate General and await the final decision of the court,\" Google said in a statement. \"Irrespective of the appeal, we continue to invest in our remedy, which has been working successfully for several years, and will continue to work constructively with the European Commission.”\n\nThe commission declined to comment.\n\nThe opinion was another setback this week for Google, which also said it laid off hundreds of employees on its hardware, voice assistance and engineering teams as part of cost-cutting measures.",

        "title": "2 Top Stock-Split Stocks to Buy for 2024",
        "content": "Stock splits don't automatically boost a stock -- but they still could help you pick out a top player to buy by pointing you toward companies with track records of success. Companies generally launch a split after performing well, with the idea that more growth lies ahead.\n\nBy offering current stockholders more shares, the company lowers the price of each individual share without touching overall market value. This makes the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n\nHistory shows us that investors haven't necessarily piled into stock-split players right away, so a split itself won't trigger gains. But over time, the companies that have been successful often continue to deliver when it comes to growth, and that makes them winners over and over again.\n\nWant in on that action in 2024 and beyond? Then consider these two stock-split players to buy right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) shares soared past $3,500 back in 2021, and the company split its stock a year later. Some near-term challenges -- including the pressure of higher costs due to interest-rate hikes -- got in the way of its post-split performance. But the company set to work on its cost structure and reignited earnings growth, and its shares climbed in the double digits last year.\n\nDespite the gain, the stock still trades at about half of what it traded for a couple of years ago in relation to forward earnings estimates. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nConsidering Amazon's long-term prospects, this looks like a deal to me. Why am I so optimistic about the stock? For a few reasons. First, Amazon is a leader in two markets growing in the double digits -- e-commerce and cloud computing -- so it's well positioned to benefit from this growth over time.\n\nSecond, the company is ensuring this dominance, thanks to its work on serving customers well in both businesses. For example, in e-commerce, Amazon has put into place infrastructure to gain in delivery speed, which should keep customers coming back. And in cloud computing, Amazon Web Services has built up its artificial intelligence (AI) services, offering clients easy ways to apply this hot technology to their businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Amazon's cost-structure improvements should serve it well over time -- whether the economy is weak or strong. The company has already shifted from losses and cash outflows during a difficult 2022 to profit and billion-dollar inflows of cash a year later. All of this means now and into the future, Amazon could deliver a lot more gains in earnings and share price.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) also split its stock in recent times after many years of earnings growth and top share performance. GOOG Chart\n\nToday, we don't have any reason to believe the company's dominance in its market, earnings growth, and stock market gains will stop. By maintaining decent growth through difficult economic times, Alphabet showed its strength -- and its shares may even be ready to extend last year's gains.\n\nOne big reason to like this company has to do with its leadership in the internet search market. Most of us are used to \"Googling it\" when we don't know the answer to a question. It's become part of our routine, and that has led Alphabet's Google to a 91% share of the search market.\n\nWhat's key here is this brand strength has become Alphabet's moat, or competitive advantage. It will be very difficult for a competitor to grab a significant share and unseat this top player.\n\nImportantly, this market share doesn't just give Alphabet bragging rights but is key to the company bringing in revenue. Thanks to the company's search position, advertisers flock to Alphabet to advertise -- so when you search on Google, you'll see an ad that may be linked to something you would like to buy. Alphabet's investment in AI today to make search better and better should serve as the element that seals the deal with advertisers for the long term -- and that's more good news for the company and investors.\n\nFinally, Alphabet's cloud computing business may not be as big as Amazon's, but it's high growth -- with revenue climbing in the double digits in the most recent quarter.\n\nToday, you can pick up shares of this technology powerhouse for only 21 times forward earnings estimates. And that looks dirt cheap considering Alphabet's earnings and market-share track record -- and the likelihood of all of that growth continuing over the long term.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Google has laid off hundreds of employees working on its hardware, voice assistance and engineering teams as part of cost-cutting measures.\n\nThe cuts come as Google looks towards “responsibly investing in our company’s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,” the company said in a statement.\n\n“Some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally,” it said.\n\nGoogle earlier said it was eliminating a few hundred roles, with most of the impact on its augmented reality hardware team.\n\nThe cuts follow pledges by executives of Google and its parent company Alphabet to reduce costs. A year ago, Google said it would lay off 12,000 employees or around 6% of its workforce.\n\nIn a post on X — previously known as Twitter — the Alphabet Workers Union described the job cuts as “another round of needless layoffs.”\n\n“Our members and teammates work hard every day to build great products for our users, and the company cannot continue to fire our coworkers while making billions every quarter,\" the union wrote. \"We won’t stop fighting until our jobs are safe!”\n\nGoogle is not the only technology company cutting back. In the past year, Meta -- the parent company of Facebook -- has slashed more than 20,000 jobs to reassure investors. Meta’s stock price gained about 178% in 2023.\n\nSpotify said in December that it was axing 17% of its global workforce, the music streaming service’s third round of layoffs in 2023  as it moved to slash costs and improve its profitability.\n\nEarlier this week, Amazon laid off hundreds of employees in its Prime Video and studios units. It also will lay off about 500 employees who work on its livestreaming platform Twitch.\n\nAmazon has cut thousands of jobs after a hiring surge during the pandemic. In March, Amazon announced that it planned to lay off 9,000 employees, on top of 18,000 employees it said that it would lay off in January 2023.\n\nGoogle is currently locked in a fierce rivalry with Microsoft as both firms strive to lead in the artificial intelligence domain.\n\nMicrosoft has stepped up its artificial intelligence offerings to rival Google’s. In September, Microsoft introduced a Copilot feature that incorporates artificial intelligence into products like search engine Bing, browser Edge as well as Windows for its corporate customers.",

Hundreds of roles in the search giant's central engineering team are also being impacted, the company said.\n\nGoogle bought health and fitness tracking company Fitbit for $2.1 billion in 2021 but has continued to roll out new versions of its Pixel Watch, a product that competes with some of Fitbit's devices and also the Apple Watch.\n\n\"Throughout second-half of 2023, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, and to align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Some teams are continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role eliminations globally,\" a spokesperson for Google told Reuters in a statement.\n\nThe spokesperson did not specify the number of roles being impacted. It is not immediately clear how many people are part of the Google Assistant software and other teams.\n\nThe reorganization of certain teams comes at a time when companies like Microsoft and Google are betting on the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology following the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nLast year, Google announced plans to add generative AI capabilities to its virtual assistant. AI would allow the assistant to do things like help people plan a trip or catch up on emails and then ask follow-up questions.\n\nIn January 2023, Alphabet announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs, equivalent to 6% of its global workforce.\n\nAs of September 2023, Alphabet had 182,381 employees globally.

That sent shock waves through Silicon Valley. But the company continued to make smaller trims over the course of 2023, including layoffs within teams focused on recruiting, news products and the Waze mapping app.\n\nRead More: Amazon Is Laying Off Hundreds in Prime Video, Studios Unit\n\nWhile the large round of cuts in January 2023 was telegraphed by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, this year’s reductions have been communicated by lower-level leaders, such as vice presidents and human resources, according to a current employee and a former worker.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com Inc. also laid off hundreds of staff in its Prime Video and studios business this week, raising questions about whether another major round of layoffs was underway in Silicon Valley.\n\nSemafor first reported the layoffs to the Google Assistant team, while 9to5Google first reported the reorganization for hardware. Affected staff have begun receiving the news and will have the opportunity to apply for open positions elsewhere within Google, the company said.\n\nThe Alphabet Workers Union, which represents some of its employees, criticized the job cuts in a statement posted to the social network X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“Our members and teammates work hard every day to build great products for our users, and the company cannot continue to fire our coworkers while making billions every quarter,” the group said. “We won’t stop fighting until our jobs are safe!”\n\n--With assistance from Josh Eidelson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTrumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election US Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China’s War Machine Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Comes Under a Microscope Five ETFs to Watch in 2024 Tropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Crucial inflation data ahead\n\nHeadline U.S. inflation is expected to have sped up marginally in December, while the annual underlying reading is seen slowing, as Federal Reserve officials search for signs of easing price gains before rolling out possible interest rate cuts this year.\n\nEconomists estimate that the year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) from the world's largest economy accelerated to 3.2% last month, up from 3.1% in November. Month-on-month, the pace is projected to increase to 0.2%.\n\nBut the rate of the so-called \"core\" measure, which strips out volatile items like food and energy, is tipped to drop to 3.8%, down from 4.0% in the prior month. On a monthly basis, core CPI is anticipated to match November's figure of 0.3%.\n\nFed policymakers will likely be closely watching the data, which could factor into how they approach rate reductions later in 2024. In a speech on Wednesday, New York Fed President John Williams argued it is still too soon to call for cuts because inflation is well above the bank's stated 2% target.\n\nWilliams' comments echoed sentiments from other rate-setters, who have recently moved to temper soaring market enthusiasm for potential reductions early this year. This optimism, fueled in part by a dovish Fed outlook last month, drove a rally in stocks in the final weeks of 2023 that has since lost some steam.\n\n2. Futures edge higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Thursday, with traders gearing up for the publication of the inflation data at 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT).\n\nBy 05:04 ET (10:04 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 40 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had increased by 8 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 59 points or 0.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main indices on Wall Street closed in the green on Wednesday. The benchmark S&P 500 rose by 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed by 0.8%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 0.5%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) touched a fresh record high after peer TSMC posted fourth-quarter revenue that beat expectations, while Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit its highest intraday level since 2021 following a price target upgrade from anaysts at Mizuho.\n\nAlong with inflation, investors are awaiting a raft of financial results from major U.S. banks later in the week.\n\n3. SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin was trading higher on Thursday after the top U.S. securities regulator approved the first exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, Bitcoin had risen 1.4% to $46,283.4.\n\nIn a decision that is anticipated to have sweeping implications for the wider crypto industry, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light on Wednesday to 11 applications from a range of issuers, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity as well as digital currency asset manager Grayscale.\n\nSome proponents of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, have claimed that the SEC's approval would spark a rush of demand into the token. Through a spot Bitcoin ETF, investors will have the chance to gain exposure to the digital asset without directly owning it. Detractors have, however, flagged that ETFs could persuade retail traders to pour money into a sector that has been beset with a spate of fraud-related scandals and huge volatility.\n\nThe decision, which was backed by SEC Chair and known crypto-skeptic Gary Gensler, marked a U-turn for a commission that has largely been reticent to sign off on a spot Bitcoin ETF for much of the past decade. It also comes after hackers temporarily took control of the SEC's account on social media platform X on Wednesday and falsely claimed that the regulator had already approved the applications, sparking wild fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin.\n\n4. Google announces lay-offs across multiple teams - reports\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is dismissing hundreds of its employees across several divisions to decrease costs and support an ongoing push into artificial intelligence, according to media reports.\n\nCiting a Google spokesperson, the reports said the lay-offs will impact workers at the search giant's core engineering division. Hundreds of roles at its Voice Assistant division, as well as the hardware team behind its Pixel phone, Nest smart home devices, and Fitbit watches, will be eliminated.\n\nThe exact number of employees losing their jobs was not immediately specified by Google, the reports said.\n\nGoogle's cuts extend a continuing trend of job reductions in the tech industry. On Wednesday, e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reportedly laid off several hundred employees at its live-streaming unit Twitch, Prime Video service and MGM studios.\n\n5. Oil rebounds following U.S. inventories build\n\nOil prices rose Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s weakness as attacks on shipping through the Red Sea persisted.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% higher at $72.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 1.8% to $78.18 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks settled lower on Wednesday after official data showed an unexpected weekly build of 1.3 million barrels in U.S. inventories, contrasting with earlier industry data that signaled a weekly draw.\n\nWhile the build was minimal, the data also showed a second straight week of large product inventory builds, pointing to softness in U.S. fuel demand. This notion was exacerbated by a severe winter storm on the east coast of the country, which further disrupted road travel in the world’s largest fuel consumer.\n\nHowever, the market remained supported by ongoing concerns about disruptions to Middle East supplies after Yemen-based Houthis mounted their largest attack yet on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. CPI ahead, SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ considers lowering FY2024 inflation outlook to mid-2% range - Jiji\n\nTrump's civil fraud trial: four key moments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is having anything but a happy new year, as the company’s stock was hit with its third downgrade in less than two weeks on Wednesday. The latest sting comes from Redburn Atlantic’s James Cordwell, who lowered the stock’s rating to Neutral while keeping its price target at $200, on fears of slowing iPhone sales and the potential for regulatory headwinds.\n\nBarclays and Piper Sandler also issued downgrades on Apple’s stock, last week, with Barclays' Tim Long rerating the stock from Equal Weight to Underweight and lowering its price target from $161 to $160. Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar, meanwhile, downgraded Apple’s stock to Neutral.\n\nShares of the tech giant have fallen roughly 4% in the first few days of 2024, as of Wednesday afternoon. Shares of Apple’s Big Tech peers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META), on the other hand, are up 1.9%, 2.2%, and 4.9%, respectively.\n\nIn general, Redburn Atlantic, Barclays, and Piper Sandler point to potential weakness across Apple’s iPhone and services segment. Barclays' Long and Piper Sandler’s Kumar both point to China as a major concern, with Long saying that Barclays' latest checks show incrementally worse iPhone 15 data points out of the region, and Kumar citing China’s deteriorating macro environment.\n\nGreater China is Apple’s third-largest revenue driver behind North America and Europe. In 2023, the area accounted for $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue.\n\nAccording to Long, while Apple should report December quarter revenue in line with market expectations, the company will report March revenue below the market consensus. Apple's Vision Pro could be a catalyst that helps power the company's shares into 2024. (Loren Elliott/REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nKumar, for his part, says negative news surrounding the ongoing Apple Watch patent controversy and antitrust fights could prove to be problematic for Apple moving forward.\n\nMost analysts are still positive on Apple\n\nBut Wall Street isn’t entirely down on the iPhone maker. Of the 53 analysts tracking Apple, 32 maintain Buy ratings, while 16 have Hold ratings. Just five analysts have Sell ratings on the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvercore ISI’s Amit Daryanani reiterated his Outperform rating on Apple with a price target of $220, saying that now might be the time to buy the dip in the company’s stock price.\n\nAnd while he admits Apple Watch bans are problematic and Apple’s multibillion-dollar agreement to make Google the default search engine in Safari might be at risk, there are more positives than negatives to Apple’s story.\n\n“As some of the fears abate and we shift to a more positive news flow (Vision Pro), [Apple] could start to re-rate in a more positive manner,” Daryanani wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring says that Apple’s 2024 could offer a big lift for the company.\n\n“We believe that not only are fundamentals on the path to recovery (albeit with some near-term unevenness), but more importantly, 2024 will be the year when Apple's 'Edge AI' opportunity likely comes to fruition, highlighted by an LLM-powered Siri 2.0 and a broader Gen AI-enabled operating system (introduced at WWDC in June) that has the potential to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle,” he wrote in a note to investors.\n\nApple hasn’t specifically announced a generative AI offering, instead focusing on machine learning to improve the accuracy of its autocomplete feature. But the company is reportedly hard at work integrating the technology into its future products.\n\nApple could also stand to benefit from an expected resurgence in laptop and desktop sales, as consumers who purchased computers at the start of the pandemic begin to seek out newer, faster systems. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAll of this comes as Apple prepares to launch its $3,499 Vision Pro spatial computing headset in February. Preorders for the device start Jan. 19. Apple’s first new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro is expected to get off to a slow sales start as a result of its relatively high price.\n\nAnd depending on how the Vision Pro roll out goes, Apple could drive a significant amount of interest in the headset among both consumers and enterprise users. No, most people won’t be able to afford the Vision Pro out of the gate, but even creating buzz around the product could benefit Apple’s stock price.\n\nWith the Vision Pro launch just a few short weeks away, we won’t have to wait long to see if Apple’s slow start to 2024 is a fluke or long-term trend.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "OpenAI Launches New Store For Users to Share Custom Chatbots",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI has launched an online store where people can share customized versions of the company’s popular ChatGPT chatbot, after initially delaying the rollout because of leadership upheaval last year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff SEC Says FBI Is Investigating Compromise of Agency’s X Account Boeing CEO Fights Back Tears and Admits ‘Our Mistake’ in 737 Address Treasury 10-Year Yield Is Back Above 4% Before CPI: Markets Wrap\n\nThe new store, which rolled out Wednesday to paid ChatGPT users, will corral the chatbots that users create for a variety of tasks, for example a version of ChatGPT that can teach math to a child or come up with colorful cocktail recipes. The product, called the GPT Store, will include chatbots that users have chosen to share publicly. It will eventually introduce ways for people to make money from their creations — much as they might through the app stores of Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nSimilar to those app stores, OpenAI’s GPT Store will let users see the most popular and trending chatbots on a leaderboard and search for them by category. In a blog post announcing the rollout, OpenAI said that people have made 3 million custom chatbots thus far, though it was not clear how many were available through its store at launch.The store’s launch comes as OpenAI works to build out its ecosystem of services and find new sources of revenue. On Wednesday, OpenAI also announced a new paid ChatGPT tier for companies with smaller teams that starts at $25 a month per user. OpenAI first launched a corporate version of ChatGPT with added features and privacy safeguards in August.\n\nPeople who pay for ChatGPT access — including enterprise customers and ChatGPT Plus subscribers — are eligible to use or make custom GPTs. Initially users won’t be able to profit off their chatbots, OpenAI said. But within the first three months of the year the company will share details on how people can make money from them. The company said in its blog post that people in the US will be paid “based on user engagement” with their chatbots.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenAI originally said it planned to introduce the store in late November, but delayed the rollout to this year, citing interruptions caused by the ousting and reinstatement of Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman in November.\n\nThe startup will feature new GPTs each week. At the time of its launch, the chatbots it highlighted included one from the company Canva that helps people design logos, flyers and other media, and another that recommends recreational hiking trails.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTrumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election Tropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire US Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China’s War Machine Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Comes Under a Microscope Is There Any Hope for Hollywood?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best innovative stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our introduction to what innovation is all about and why it's the most rewarded trait on the stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nInnovation is at the heart of human progress and share price growth. Firms that find unique solutions to business problems or customer needs end up improving their operational efficiency and creating new revenue streams. This leads to more return per dollar for a shareholder than would have been possible through other investment vehicles, in a self sustaining system that requires adept managers to dot all the i's.\n\nWhen we look at some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), one fact is clear. All of these companies created new manufacturing technology, platforms, products, and tools that were not present at scale in their industries.\n\nApple's example is worth a look here. Over the past decade, Apple's revenue has grown by 124%, providing its dividend shareholders with excellent value for their capital that is re-invested in the company through retained earnings. Apple had bled $1.8 billion in net losses during its fiscal years ending in the September of 1996 and 1997. Now, it's the world's most profitable non-state-owned company that generated $96.9 billion in profit during its previous fiscal year. Apple's success in the business world is attributed to its unique product design and the uncanny ability of its founder Steve Jobs to figure out key customer pain points before rival firms could catch on. The ability to design the right product and market it blends with the firm's complex supply chain that covers 50 countries and saw more than eight hundred independent assessments in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while Apple's shares and revenue are right at the top of the global food chain when it comes to innovation leading to triple digit growth, it is Tesla that is dominating the innovation space right now. The firm's revenue has grown by 826% on an absolute basis since 2010, since the market that it caters to is simply too big for Tesla to ever capture. Millions of cars roam the roads every day, and while it's easy to get an internal combustion (IC) car for low prices, a Tesla often costs tens of thousands of dollars. The lower cost market is a key Tesla objective, and its triple digit revenue growth is explained by the firm's innovation in manufacturing and mass producing a fundamentally different product in the market.\n\nWhile most companies on our list so far are mega-cap stocks, the one firm that isn't is Intel. Intel is the world's biggest processor company that designs and manufactures its own chips. This has been the case for quite some time now, and despite multiple slippages over the past decade, Intel still dominates simply due to its early found ability to double computing power every new processor generation. This ability enabled it to cement a market share right when computers were becoming powerful, and today, Intel is a corporate giant that controls the majority of x86 processor markets.\n\nLooking at these companies, it's clear that innovation is indispensable when aiming for success in the business world. Today, we'll look at which innovative companies are on hedge funds' radar and the notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 15 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now\n\nturtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best innovative stocks to buy, we ranked the top 30 holdings of the First Trust Innovation Leaders ETF (ILDR) by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of Q3 2023 end.

Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "title": "China's DJI launches first delivery drone globally as regulatory shift spurs competition",
        "content": "DJI, the world’s largest drone maker, officially launched its first delivery drone in the US Wednesday, entering into an increasingly crowded market that already includes Amazon (AMZN) and South San Francisco startup Zipline.\n\nThe release of FlyCart 30 (FC30) marks the Chinese firm’s first foray into the delivery drone space outside of its home market. The company, which has over 70% of the market share in the drone market, is looking to differentiate itself by focusing on industrial use cases, including in construction sites and mountainous terrain, given its ability to carry a heavy payload and operate in extreme weather.\n\n“We are optimistic that FlyCart 30 will become a trusted solution for aerial delivery, solving complex terrain and terminal transportation problems efficiently, economically, and most importantly, safely from the air,” Christina Zhang, senior director of corporate strategy at DJI, said in a statement. DJI's delivery drone. (DJI)\n\nThe FlyCart 30 can carry a payload of 60 to 70 pounds within a 10-mile radius. It uses a coaxial four-axis, eight-blade multirotor configuration and can reach a maximum flight speed of 44 miles per hour. It will retail for $42,000, according to DJI.\n\nDJI’s launch comes amid heightened interest in drone deliveries, spurred by shifting regulations. While flights have largely been limited by an FAA rule that requires drone operators to fly aircraft within sight of human visual observers, the agency has offered some waivers in recent months, allowing companies to scale operations and expand their delivery zones.\n\nDJI has not received an exemption yet but said the FC30 had been built in anticipation of a change in that rule.\n\n“That’s partly why we’ve waited to enter this space,” Wayne Baker, director of stakeholder engagement for DJI, said. “We're hoping that this is going to be beyond visual line of sight operations capable. It's built to be that way through DeliveryHub, our software solution.”\n\nDJI faces other hurdles in expanding in the US. In December 2021, the US government put DJI on an investment blacklist, citing its involvement in the surveillance of Uyghurs in Xinjiang and its military ties. While the blacklist does not prevent US residents from buying or using DJI drones, it prohibits them from trading shares of DJI. The Shenzhen-based company is also unable to source parts from US companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, FC30 has been operating in China since August of last year, enabling the company to test key use cases. The aircraft has been used to carry photovoltaic panels to solar farms and pick up large loads of trash in remote areas, according to DJI. DJI's drone. (DJI)\n\nBaker said construction zones would be the most immediate focus for the company in the US, reducing reliance on construction crews to carry heavy equipment.\n\n“[The payload] can be brought up and down at the worksite to that roof area or even that floor area because FC30 has the ability to integrate a hoist, so it doesn’t even have to land,” he said. “We’re reducing the amount of time that a person would have to go up and down ... and time it takes for construction.”\n\nBaker added that the aircraft could also assist crews in natural disasters because of its ability to withstand extreme weather. It can operate in temperatures ranging from -4° to 122° F and withstand winds up to roughly 27 miles per hour.\n\nMeet DJI’s first delivery drone - FlyCart 30\r\n\r\nOvercome traditional transport challenges and start a new era of dynamic aerial delivery with large payload capacity, long operation range, high reliability, and intelligent features. \r\n\r\nDiscover more: https://t.co/Mp6MOVaapJpic.twitter.com/AZgHgLo9OA\n\n— DJI (@DJIGlobal) January 10, 2024\n\nCommercial drone deliveries have steadily expanded in the US, as retailers turn to aerial options to meet last-mile delivery demands. Globally, deliveries exceeded 1 million in 2023, according to McKinsey. But the focus has largely been on small packages until now.\n\nOn Tuesday, Walmart announced it would expand aerial delivery to 1.8 million households in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, in partnership with Alphabet’s (GOOG) Wing and Zipline.\n\nGlobally, the commercial drone market is expected to reach $38.2 billion in 2027.\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Tech stocks soared last year as excitement over burgeoning industries like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing made Wall Street bullish. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index rose 67% throughout 2023, significantly improving from the year before when it plunged 40%. And the market has shown no signs of slowing, making 2024 an excellent time to expand your position in tech.\n\nNvidia was one of the biggest winners last year as it snapped up a majority market share in AI chips. Its stock is up 230% year over year, making it an attractive option for investing in AI and tech in general. However, some tech stocks were slightly overlooked last year and could offer more value than the chipmaker.\n\nSo, forget Nvidia. Here are two tech stocks to buy instead.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, it's impossible to deny Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) powerful role in tech.\n\nThe company's services attract billions of users, which it has used to build a lucrative digital advertising business. According to data from Statista, the digital ad market is projected to reach $740 billion in 2024, with Alphabet responsible for about 25% of the industry. Popular platforms like Google Search and YouTube present almost endless advertising opportunities for the company and have seen its earnings soar in recent years.\n\nSince 2019, Alphabet's annual revenue has risen 75%, with operating income up 108%, outperforming competitors Microsoft and Apple in both metrics.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet's free cash flow has climbed 200% in the last five years to $78 billion, indicating the company has the cash reserves to invest heavily in its research and development and venture into new areas of tech -- such as AI.\n\nAlphabet is no stranger to AI. CEO Sundar Pichai recently described the company as seven years into its \"journey as an AI-first company,\" and it has ramped up its expansion in the market. In December, the tech giant unveiled its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini, which is expected to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4 and will likely offer Alphabet significant growth potential in AI.\n\nStory continues NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThese charts show Alphabet's stock is also significantly cheaper than Nvidia's. The company has lower figures in two key valuation metrics: forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, forward P/S divides its market cap by estimated revenue. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nForward P/E and P/S are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In this case, Alphabet is a far bigger bargain than Nvidia on both fronts. Alongside solid positions in multiple areas of tech, Alphabet is a no-brainer right now.\n\n2. Intel\n\nDecades of almost unrivaled dominance in the chip industry saw Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to competition.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2023, its central processing unit (CPU) market share fell from 82% to 61%, while Advanced Micro Devices gradually grew in the sector. Then, in 2020, Intel lost one of its biggest customers when Apple ended a partnership between the tech companies in favor of in-house developed chips.\n\nHowever, rather than throwing in the towel, recent challenges have seemingly lit a fire under Intel again. The company ventured into the desktop graphics processing unit (GPU) market for the first time last year, diversifying its business with a larger role in PC gaming. Meanwhile, it is gearing up to launch a range of new AI chips that could threaten Nvidia's dominance over the long term.\n\nThe AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 and surpass a value of $1 trillion before the decade's end. The sector's massive growth potential suggests Intel won't need to dethrone Nvidia to still see significant gains from AI, which strengthens its long-term outlook. INTC PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nLike Alphabet, Intel's stock offers far more value than Nvidia. The tables above show Intel's forward P/E and P/S ratios are substantially lower than its chip rival, making its stock less of a risk. Nvidia's meteoric rise last year has made it an expensive option. However, Intel remains a bargain with significant potential in tech.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in January",
        "content": "Last year was good for many tech stocks, reversing course from the significant losses many saw in 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 led the major indexes with 55% total returns, its best year since 1999.\n\nAs optimism about the economy and the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) into the mainstream picks up, investors are returning to tech stocks in hopes of capitalizing on emerging trends. How the market plays out is yet to be seen, but there's plenty of potential that makes the investments worth it. Here are three top tech stocks to buy to start 2024.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, is the largest semiconductor (chip) foundry in the world, with a 59% market share of the global semiconductor foundry market as of the third quarter of 2023, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nTSMC doesn't make chips that can be bought off the shelf like other consumer electronics. Instead, it makes chips specifically tailored to its clients' needs. Companies come to TSMC and essentially say, \"Hey, we're building ABC and need a chip to XYZ.\"\n\nTSMC's model has worked, helping it increase revenue by over 140% over the past five years and cross the $500 billion market cap threshold. Only 11 public companies globally are valued higher. Even still, TSMC's stock increased by 42% in 2023, and it's still fairly undervalued compared to other big tech companies. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nA slowdown in smartphone and PC sales (TSMC's biggest revenue drivers) over the past couple of years slowed TSMC's revenue growth, but the worst of that is predicted to be behind us. CEO C.C. Wei noted in the third-quarter earnings call that management saw early signs of \"demand stabilization in the PC and smartphone end market.\"\n\nA rebound in smartphone and PC sales coupled with the increased demand from AI-related technologies puts TSMC in a position to see a noticeable growth in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. AT&T\n\nI'm sure I speak for many of AT&T's (NYSE: T) investors when I say the stock has been a huge disappointment for the past decade. In that span, its stock price is down 34%, far underperforming the S&P 500 and competitors like Verizon Communications and T-Mobile US. T Chart\n\nT data by YCharts\n\nDespite its troubles over the past decade, AT&T seems to be turning the corner for the better. After a failed attempt at the media and entertainment industry, AT&T has returned to its core telecom businesses, focusing on wireless and fiber internet. Wireless business growth won't explode, but fiber is an area where AT&T can expand its business.\n\nThe main reason to invest in AT&T, however, remains its dividend, which is one of the highest dividend yields in the S&P 500. Its quarterly dividend is $0.28, with a trailing 12-monthyield of around 6.5%. Although AT&T has a large amount of long-term debt, its free cash flow is more than enough to handle its debt and dividend obligations without investors fearing a reduction.\n\nAn attractive dividend should help investors remain patient while the company transitions back to its core businesses.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), hasn't seemed to receive as much media attention as its other big tech peers (especially relating to AI), but 2023 was a great year for the stock, which increased 58%.\n\nMy biggest concern with Alphabet has been how much it depends on Google advertising. Accounting for more than 77% of Alphabet's revenue in the third quarter of 2023, Google advertising is by far its most important business. However, other segments have picked up more of the slack recently, especially its cloud business and \"other bets\" segment that includes Waymo, DeepMind, and Verily.\n\nGoogle Cloud -- which is third in market share behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure -- gained 5% in market share since 2017 and now makes up 11% of Alphabet's revenue. There's still a steep climb to catch AWS and Azure, which have 32% and 22% market share, respectively, but it's encouraging to see the progress Google Cloud has made.\n\nAlphabet recently released Gemini, its most powerful AI model and GPT-4 competitor, which should considerably improve the capabilities and appeal of Google Cloud. The global cloud computing market is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 15% through 2028, widening the opportunities for all players involved. As Alphabet continues to innovate its cloud offerings, it should see a financial boost from the high-margin industry.\n\nDespite its 2023 surge, Alphabet remains a great value, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 20.5. This gives Alphabet a lot of upside for investors who have a long-term time frame.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- India stepped up its crackdown on offshore crypto exchanges operating without local registrations, asking Apple Inc. to take the apps of platforms including Binance off its App Store in the country.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSEC’s X Account Hacked to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETF Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff Bottled Water Contains More Plastic Particles Than Previously Thought US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\n\nBitfinex, HTX and Kucoin are among eight exchanges whose apps are no longer available on the App Store in India. They were removed on directions from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because the request isn’t public.\n\nThe move marks a significant escalation of India’s clampdown on offshore crypto platforms like Binance, which started Dec. 28 when authorities notified nine exchanges that they are suspected of misconduct. Indian crypto traders had already began moving deposits to local exchanges that abide by the nation’s regulations, fearful of losing access to their funds.\n\nAuthorities also asked Alphabet Inc.’s Google to remove the apps, one of the people said. Google Play Store in India still featured the exchange apps that were taken off the App Store as of 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday. Apple, Google and India’s technology ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndia’s Financial Intelligence Unit issued so-called compliance show-cause notice to the nine offshore platforms on Dec. 28 and also asked the information ministry to block the URLs of the entities. The FIU at the time said the exchanges are operating illegally in India without complying with anti-money laundering laws. The websites are still accessible from India.\n\nOf the exchanges singled out in that announcement, only Bitstamp was still available to download on the local App Store on Wednesday. Of the two versions US-based Kraken offers, only the Pro version was available.\n\nStory continues\n\nBinance, the biggest crypto exchange, has come under intense pressure from regulators around the world who accuse it of catering to local users without a license. India joins countries including Belgium and Australia in moving to block the company, which says it doesn’t have a global headquarters and in November agreed to pay $4.3 billion as it pleaded guilty in the US to anti-money laundering and sanction violations.\n\n“The ongoing situation is not unique to Binance and impacts certain other web3 industry apps as well,” a Binance spokesperson said by email. “We are working hard to inform constructive policy-making that seeks to benefit every user and all market participants.”\n\nHTX, formerly known as Huobi, said it has no operations in India. Bitfinex, KuCoin, Bitstamp and Kraken didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIndia’s government last year imposed money-laundering provisions on the crypto sector as it tightens oversight of digital assets along with other countries. In 2022, authorities delivered a major blow to local crypto exchanges by introducing a tax on transactions that caused trading volumes to instantly plummet.\n\nLocal exchanges had complained that the 1% levy, known as Tax Deducted at Source, drove Indian crypto traders to offshore platforms that didn’t impose it, further hurting their revenues. CoinDCX Chief Executive Officer Sumit Gupta in October estimated that 95% of trading volume had moved to offshore venues.\n\n(Updates with comment from Binance in paragraph 8.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Comes Under a Microscope Private Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Is There Any Hope for Hollywood?

        "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 159% in five years. We note the stock price is up 1.5% in the last seven days.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Alphabet achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 32% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nThis free interactive report on Alphabet's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Alphabet shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 54% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 21% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Is Alphabet cheap compared to other companies?

        "title": "AI Stock Predictions: Will C3.ai Make Investors Millionaires or Paupers?",
        "content": "There’s no question 2023 was the year of artificial intelligence. It drove not only the headlines but also the bottom lines of many companies. One of the big beneficiaries of AI’s breakthrough moment was C3.ai (NYSE:AI), a leading provider of enterprise AI applications. It’s stock is up 140% over the past year.\n\nThe question for investors is can C3.ai keep the momentum going in 2024 and beyond. We know AI itself has strong tailwinds behind it for the next few years, but will they translate into greater growth for AI stock?\n\nAI Stock Has a Strong Tailwind\n\nThe increasing popularity of AI stems from its transformative potential in enhancing operational efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and innovation. It has the potential to drive corporate profits higher over the next decade and beyond.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai has strategically positioned itself to capitalize on this trend, catering to diverse industries like energy, defense, manufacturing, healthcare, and finance. And just as there is a surge in demand for AI applications across, C3.ai could be at the forefront.\n\nFirst, its strategic partnerships and contracts with major players in the tech and industrial sectors give it a boost. Collaborations with industry giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google not only validate the robustness of C3.ai’s technology but also open doors to broader market access and potential integration with existing ecosystems.\n\nOther noteworthy partnerships include those with energy giant Shell (NYSE:SHEL), defense contractor RTX (NYSE:RTX) (formerly Raytheon), and the U.S. Air Force. These solidify the company’s credibility and emphasize its relevance in critical sectors.\n\nMoreover, C3.ai is transitioning to a consumption-based pricing model from a subscription-based one. While subscriptions boast recurring revenue streams for companies, the consumption-based model lowers costs and allows for greater personalization for customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s a strategic move that gives C3.ai the chance to better align itself with the evolving needs of clients and positions its platform as an attractive option in an increasingly competitive AI software marketplace.\n\nThe Easy Part Is Done\n\nWhile C3.ai demonstrates considerable growth potential, it faces several roadblocks that could impede its trajectory. The business model change is helping revenue grow, up 14% year-to-date to $145 million, but losses are widening too.\n\nOperating losses grew to $290 million last year from $60 million two years prior, and they’re already up to $153 million over the first six months of the current fiscal year.\n\nDespite its innovative solutions and strategic partnerships, achieving profitability in the competitive AI landscape might be challenging.\n\nHigh research and development costs, customer acquisition expenses, and the need for continuous innovation place a strain on the company’s financials. To sustain long-term growth, C3.ai must carefully balance its investments with revenue generation.\n\nThat could prove difficult if a recession hits and companies rein in spending. While the promise of AI is great, businesses still need to see real-world results. An economic downturn could see them pullback spending on unproven technologies. And with C3.ai counting on businesses consuming growing amounts of product that could hit topline results.\n\nThe intense competitive landscape itself poses a formidable hurdle. Several tech giants and nimble startups are vying for dominance in this space, creating a crowded and competitive market.\n\nC3.ai faces the task of differentiating itself from competitors, proving the superiority of its solutions, and continually innovating to stay ahead. The rapid advancements in AI technology also mean it needs to stay at the forefront of innovation to remain relevant.\n\nStart Small\n\nSo far C3.ai has navigated the minefield of risk fairly well. The launch of ChatGPT thrust it into the forefront in late 2022, and the company capitalized on the newfound interest in the field. Because it’s still early innings in the space, today’s leader could be tomorrow’s has-been and vice versa.\n\nThe meteoric rise of AI stock suggests a lot of its potential has already been priced in. I wouldn’t sell my shares at these levels, but I wouldn’t be a big buyer either.\n\nIf you’ve already established a stake hold onto it. If you’re new to C3.ai, then buy just a small tranche and add to it if shares fall. AI is going to make millionaires out of investors, but it’s much too early to say who will become the real winners.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in RTX stock.

        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index has delivered a gain of 67,036% (including dividends) since it was established in 1957. That translates to an average annual return of 10.2%, compounded.\n\nThat's more than twice the return investors could earn if they held cash right now, even with interest rates at a 15-year high.\n\nBut, historically, investors who purchased specific individual stocks have far outperformed the return of the S&P 500. I'm going to share 10 stocks that have crushed the index since their initial public offering (IPO), and they have the potential to help you beat the market going forward, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms: 826% return since IPO\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Its stock came public in 2012, and it has since gained 826%, which translates to a compound annual return of 22.4%. That's twice the long-run average of the S&P 500.\n\nBut it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Meta stock fell 76% from peak to trough between 2021 and 2022 and then roared back to life with a 194% gain in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), the company delivered a record amount of revenue, and its net income (profit) surged 163% year over year.\n\nMeta stock is still cheap relative to the broader technology sector, and more market-beating returns might be ahead this year and beyond as the company ramps up its investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks: 1,920% return since IPO\n\nThe next market-beating stock is Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW), a world-leading cybersecurity company that came public in 2012. Its stock has soared by 1,920% since then, or by a compound annual rate of 31.4%, and it spent much of 2023 making record highs.\n\nInvestors have rewarded the company's growing investments in futuristic AI-powered cybersecurity, which are already attracting significant amounts of revenue. Palo Alto's one-year-old Cortex XSIAM product is a security operations solution designed to reduce reliance on human-led, manual incident response with the help of AI. It has already amassed $1 billion in bookings, with one large organization using it to protect 300,000 computers and devices (endpoints).\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto is on track to deliver a record-high $8.2 billion in total revenue during the current fiscal year 2024 (ending July 31, 2024). Considering that the cost of cyberattacks continues to soar, investing in one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the world might be a great move for your money going forward.\n\n3. Alphabet (Google): 6,311% return since IPO\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, but it's also home to other famous tech subsidiaries like YouTube and self-driving vehicle developer Waymo. Google stock came public in 2004 (it changed its name to Alphabet in 2015), and it has since delivered a return of 6,311%. That's equivalent to a compound annual gain of 24.5%.\n\nAdvertising dollars generated from Google Search remain Alphabet's single largest source of revenue, but a notable contribution also comes from its cloud computing platform, Google Cloud. It's growing in importance because it's where the conglomerate monetizes many of its AI initiatives, from new data center chips to large language models that form the foundation of AI software applications.\n\nLike Meta, Alphabet stock also trades at an attractive valuation compared to its big-tech peers, and that could pave the way for more upside going forward.\n\n4. Netflix: 44,146% return since IPO\n\nNext up is streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). It came public in 2002, shortly after the dot-com tech bubble burst, and its stock has delivered a red-hot gain of 44,146% since then. That translates to an annual return of 33.7%, compounded.\n\nNetflix has disrupted everything from video rental stores to cable television. Its streaming service has become the largest in the world, with 247 million paying members, and the company continues to grow its addressable market by offering cheaper subscription tiers and by expanding into new territories.\n\nNetflix is the only stand-alone streaming provider generating a profit, which bodes well for its long-term staying power compared to its peers, many of which are slashing costs right now. That could lead to more market share for Netflix over time and more gains for its stock. Image source: Netflix.\n\n5. Apple: 181,080% return since IPO\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's first $3 trillion company, and its stock has been one of the best performers in the history of the market. It has delivered a gain of 181,080% since its IPO in 1980, or a compound annual return of 19%.\n\nThe iPhone smartphone has become the company's biggest value creator, leading to other billion-dollar hardware products like the Watch and AirPods. Apple also has a booming services segment led by the subscription-based Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV. But AI might be one of the biggest reasons to own the stock going forward.\n\nThe company's iPhone 15 Pro features an Apple-designed A17 Pro chip that can process AI workloads on-device. It's reportedly working on a large language model and AI chatbot, and the ability to run such applications on the smartphone (as opposed to in the cloud) could mark a new dawn in mobile computing and pave the way for new features. It's hard to go wrong owning this tried-and-true long-term performer.\n\n6. Amazon: 193,553% return since IPO\n\nIt started out selling books online in 1994, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has transformed into one of the most diversified technology companies in the world. It came public in 1997, and its stock has soared by 193,553% since. That's a compound annual return of 33.8%, tripling the long-run average annual return of the S&P 500.\n\nE-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, but the company draws most of its profit from its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is spearheading the company's AI initiatives, from developing data center chips to helping businesses develop their own AI applications. Amazon even purchased a $4 billion stake in leading AI start-up Anthropic late last year.\n\nBut there's even more to this company. Its streaming service -- Prime -- is second only to Netflix in memberships, and its digital advertising business is one of the fastest-growing pieces of the entire company. Simply put, Amazon stock is a great way for investors to expose their portfolios to the digital economy, and it's trading at a very attractive valuation. Image source: Amazon.\n\n7. Nvidia: 196,288% return since IPO\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the star of 2023, logging a bigger gain than any other stock in the S&P 500. It has a history of spectacular growth; it came public in 1999, and since then, its stock has surged 196,288%. That translates to a 37.2% annual return, compounded.\n\nNvidia's business is currently driven by astronomical demand for its AI data center chips, specifically the H100 and upcoming H200. The world's largest data center operators have raced to give their business customers access to enough computing power to handle AI workloads so they can develop applications and integrate productivity-boosting AI into their workflows. Nvidia has a dominant market share in this area, and there are very few viable alternatives right now.\n\nIn the recent fiscal year 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's data center revenue surged by a whopping 279% year over year, to $14.5 billion. The company's Q4 forecast suggests it will end the year with a record $58.8 billion in total revenue, and Wall Street predicts it could deliver $92.2 billion in fiscal 2025. In other words, there appears to be plenty of growth left in the tank.\n\n8. Oracle: 221,826% return since IPO\n\nFounded in 1977, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is one of America's oldest technology companies. It executed its IPO in 1986, and its stock has since recorded a gain of 221,826%, translating to a compound annual return of 23.1%.\n\nOracle started out developing database management software, but today it's a leading provider of cloud-based applications designed to boost productivity in dozens of industries. Investors are intently focused on the infrastructure segment of Oracle's cloud business because the company says its Nvidia GPU chip clusters can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of other leading cloud providers.\n\nOracle has already signed up leading AI start-ups like Cohere and Elon Musk's xAI, and the company is now building 100 new data centers (on top of its existing 66) because it can't keep up with demand. Therefore, now could be a great time to buy Oracle stock ahead of what could be a growth surge in the coming years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n9. Microsoft: 504,247% return since IPO\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is nipping at Apple's heels for the title of world's most valuable company. It has a market cap of $2.7 trillion, so it isn't far away. However, Microsoft has delivered a much larger gain than Apple since its IPO in 1986 (it came public with a much smaller valuation). Microsoft stock has soared 504,247% to date, or by 25.9% compounded annually.\n\nMicrosoft still operates some of its flagship software products, like the Windows operating system and Word. But it also expanded into hardware (computers and devices), gaming, cloud computing, and AI. Last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in leading AI start-up OpenAI, which developed the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models into its Azure cloud platform, Bing search engine, 365 document suite, and Edge internet browser, among other products. It's allowing the company to successfully monetize AI already, with 18,000 businesses signed up to its Azure OpenAI Service cloud segment and tens of thousands of organizations using its AI Copilot tool for 365 in the early access program.\n\nThose AI integrations could drive the next leg of Microsoft's growth, and with its stock near an all-time high, investors certainly appear optimistic.\n\n10. Berkshire Hathaway: 3,787,464% return since IPO\n\nFinally, the stock on this list that has created the most value is Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). It's an investment company led by none other than Warren Buffett, who steered it to a 3,787,464% increase in value between 1965 (when he took the helm) and 2022.\n\nThat is a compound annual return of 19.8%, and while it's a lesser yearly gain than some other stocks I've mentioned, Berkshire's ability to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 on a consistent basis for 58 years shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nBerkshire owns a $358 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, with large positions in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. It also wholly owns private companies like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Its diverse exposure to so many different industries has been the secret sauce to its consistent returns over such a long period of time.\n\nIf you're looking for a stock with a solid track record of crushing the S&P 500, then look no further.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Apple Returns to List of Top US Employers as Other Tech Firms Lose Appeal",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. returned to an annual list of the 100 best places to work after falling off last year, but the ranking wasn’t as rich with technology firms after layoffs roiled the sector.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSEC’s X Account Hacked to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETF Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff Bottled Water Contains More Plastic Particles Than Previously Thought US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\n\nThe iPhone maker was No. 39 in the list from Glassdoor, a website where employees submit anonymous workplace reviews. Glassdoor has conducted the survey since 2009. Apple was one of 31 tech-industry firms on the list, down from 41 last year, leaving more room for old-line employers like banks, retailers and manufacturers. The best company to work for was management consultant Bain & Co., followed by chipmaker Nvidia Corp., whose products underpin the booming artificial intelligence field.\n\n“Tech has lost some of its luster versus the past year,” said Glassdoor’s lead economist Daniel Zhao. “It’s still a great industry for jobseekers, but the shine has worn off to some extent. And the companies making a comeback, they’re the old guard, so it suggests we’re heading back to a more balanced job market.”\n\nWhile Apple’s return-to-office push in 2022 may have been to blame for its falling off the list last year, the tech bellwether’s lack of large-scale layoffs compared with its peers likely brought it back, Zhao said, as employees value “stability and security.” The 48% gain in Apple’s shares last year — double the benchmark S&P 500’s increase — probably also kept employees satisfied.\n\nOther prominent tech firms on the list include Adobe Inc. at 15, Microsoft Corp. at 18 and Alphabet Inc.’s Google at 26, while Salesforce Inc., Intel Corp., Netflix Inc. and Yahoo Inc. fell off. In finance, Fidelity Investments ranked tenth, up from 18th the previous year. New financial firms making an appearance include Raymond James Financial at 14, Barclays Plc at 72 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 82, while BlackRock Inc. didn’t make the cut after being included on the 2023 list.\n\nStory continues\n\nWork-life balance gained importance for many employees last year — mentions of “anxiety” in posts on Glassdoor’s community sites shot up fourfold — but factors such as career opportunities traditionally carry more weight, Zhao said. Bain’s rise to number one for the sixth time was fueled by its reputation for career enhancement, he said, despite the industry’s well-publicized long hours. Bain and Google are the only two firms that have made the list every year.\n\nWith some tech stalwarts fading — Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. missed the cut for the second straight year — more companies from other industries filled the void. The number of retail companies more than doubled to 10, with Lululemon Athletica Inc. and HEB Grocery Co. making repeat appearances while regional supermarket chain Wegmans Food Markets made the cut after not being on last year’s list. Manufacturing firms doubled their presence to six companies, including medical-device maker Boston Scientific Corp., engine maker Cummins Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.\n\nTo be considered for the list, firms must have more than 1,000 employees and receive at least 75 employee ratings over the past year on nine workplace attributes, such as compensation, culture and senior management. The rating threshold resulted in last year’s No. 1, software company Gainsight Inc., falling off the list entirely this year as it didn’t receive enough reviews, Zhao said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Comes Under a Microscope Private Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Is There Any Hope for Hollywood?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned +4.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet Inc. belongs, has gained 2.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.62 per share, indicating a change of +54.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 points to a change of +27.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 indicates a change of +15.6% from what Alphabet Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $70.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.8%. The $254.75 billion and $284.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.9% and +11.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet Inc. reported revenues of $64.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $1.55 for the same period compares with $1.06 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.45%. The EPS surprise was +6.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alphabet Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Ascends While Market Falls: Some Facts to Note",
        "content": "The latest trading session saw Alphabet (GOOGL) ending at $140.95, denoting a +1.52% adjustment from its last day's close. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.15% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.42%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.09%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the internet search leader had gained 4.16% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.19% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.5% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, Alphabet is projected to report earnings of $1.62 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 54.29%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $70.59 billion, up 11.83% from the year-ago period.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 1.29% increase. As of now, Alphabet holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Alphabet is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 20.59.

        "title": "The European bureaucrat who sends a chill through Big Tech just said she’s looking closely at Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI",
        "content": "Microsoft’s investment in AI unicorn OpenAI is a success story for the legacy tech company. The Redmond, Wash.-based giant, once seen as a tech dinosaur plodding to catch up with the likes of Apple and Google, has seen its fortunes turn since investing billions in the buzzy AI startup.\n\nBut now a reported investigation by the European Commission threatens to put that deal in danger.\n\nThe EC said Tuesday it is examining whether Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI, which includes an investment reported to be between $10 billion and $13 billion, would violate merger regulations aimed at protecting competition in the bloc. Britain’s top regulator, known as the Competition and Markets Authority, opened a similar inquiry into OpenAI and Microsoft’s relationship last month.\n\nThe commission is “closely monitoring AI partnerships to ensure they do not unduly distort market dynamics,” Margrethe Vestager, the EC’s executive vice president in charge of competition policy, said in a statement. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVestager is a vocal advocate of regulating Big Tech, a sector whose most influential companies continue to expand into new markets like AI while crowding out competitors in existing ones like cloud computing or digital advertising. The EC looked into a few of Apple’s practices including its iMessage system, Apple Pay, and the App Store over allegations the company unfairly excluded competitors, garnering concessions in each probe. Vestager took a particularly hard stance on Alphabet, with the EC instructing it to break up its online advertising business. (Alphabet said it will appeal the EC’s recommendation.) Vestager and her team also fined Alphabet several times over the past few years for a total of 8.3 billion euros, including imposing the commission’s largest ever single fine of 4.1 billion euros in September 2022.\n\nThe latest inquiry into a U.S. tech company indicates the EC is unlikely to pull back on its regulatory efforts. Lawmakers in the European Union seem to share that goal as well, having proposed two major sets of legislation aimed at limiting the tech industry. Companies that either don't comply with the EU's new laws or otherwise fail to pass regulatory muster with the commission could face fines up to 6% of their revenue or even be kicked out of doing business in the 27-country bloc.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext week, Vestager is expected to travel to the U.S. to meet with the CEOs of tech giants including Apple’s Tim Cook, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang. A meeting with two OpenAI executives, chief technology officer Mira Murati and chief strategy officer Jason Kwon, is reportedly also on the books.\n\n‘The next powerful thing’\n\nEver since the world’s biggest tech companies released their generative AI tools to the public, Vestager has been vocal about her desire to rein in developers and implement safeguards for the public. Last May, she spearheaded a joint initiative between the U.S. and the European Union to develop a voluntary code of conduct for AI. \"Generative AI is a complete game-changer,\" Vestager said at the time. \"Everyone knows this is the next powerful thing.\"\n\nMicrosoft’s OpenAI investments come on the heels of another EC probe into the Windows maker. Last year, the commission investigated Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion merger with video game company Activision Blizzard. American and British regulators also investigated the deal over concerns that Microsoft, which makes the popular Xbox console and has a thriving cloud-computing sector that supports online gaming, would wield too much influence if it also owned a video game developer. While the deal was ultimately approved, the EC required Microsoft to grant rival companies access to Activision’s games.\n\nMicrosoft also faces an antitrust allegation from a rival tech company in Europe. German video conferencing company Alfaview filed a complaint with the EC last summer over Microsoft’s bundling of its video call platform Teams with Office.\n\nPrior to the EC’s investigation announcement, OpenAI reportedly began a pressure campaign to water down parts of the draft AI regulations European lawmakers were developing. The law, eventually adopted in June, requires developers of general purpose AI like ChatGPT to abide by certain transparency and safety requirements.\n\nMicrosoft, in addition to being OpenAI’s biggest investor, has always had a close relationship with the startup. Those ties received close attention during the brief ouster and subsequent return of OpenAI CEO and cofounder Sam Altman. Microsoft was blindsided by Altman’s firing, reportedly learning about it only a minute before it was announced publicly, and the episode raised questions about OpenAI’s obligations to its largest investor as well as its opaque and unusual corporate structure. OpenAI is structured as a nonprofit, with a for-profit subsidiary that develops ChatGPT and AI image generator DALL-E, and which Microsoft has invested in. The ensuing turmoil strengthened Microsoft’s position as it successfully pushed for the return of Altman, its preferred CEO, and secured a nonvoting board seat.\n\nWhen reached for comment about the EC’s announcement and its relationship with OpenAI, Microsoft replied: “Since 2019, we’ve forged a partnership with OpenAI that has fostered more AI innovation and competition, while preserving independence for both companies,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Fortune. “The only thing that has changed recently is that Microsoft will now have a nonvoting observer on OpenAI’s board.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "UPDATE 1-Google faces $1.67 bln damages demand at AI-related patent trial",
        "content": "(New throughout, adds details from trial)\n\nBy Blake Brittain and Nate Raymond\n\nBOSTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google went before a federal jury in Boston on Tuesday to argue against a computer scientist's claims that it should pay his company $1.67 billion for infringing patents that allegedly cover the processors used to power artificial intelligence technology in Google products.\n\nA lawyer for Singular Computing, founded by Massachusetts-based computer scientist Joseph Bates, told jurors that Google copied Bates' technology after repeatedly meeting with him to discuss his ideas to solve a problem central to developing AI.\n\nThe lawyer, Kerry Timbers, said that after Bates shared his computer-processing innovations with Google from 2010 to 2014, the tech giant unbeknownst to him copied his patented technology rather than licensing it to develop its own AI-supporting chips.\n\nBates' innovations were built into Google's Tensor Processing Units, used it to support AI features in Google Search, Gmail, Google Translate and other Google services, Kerry said.\n\nInternal emails cited in the case show Google's now-chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wrote to others about how Bates' ideas could be \"really well suited\" for what Google was developing. Another employee in an email said they were \"quite corrupted by Joe's ideas.\"\n\n\"This case is about something we all learned a long time ago: respect for others, don’t take what doesn’t belong to you, and give credit where credit is due,\" Timbers told jurors in his opening statement.\n\nA lawyer for Google, Robert Van Nest, countered that the Google employees who designed its chips never met Bates and designed them independently of the workers who did.\n\nHe called Bates a \"a disappointed inventor\" who had failed repeatedly to convince a myriad of companies including Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc and ChatGPT-creator OpenAI to use his technology. Van Nest said Bates' technology used approximate math that can generate \"incorrect\" calculations.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Google's chips are fundamentally different, fundamentally different, than what is described in Singular's patents,\" Van Nest told the jury.\n\nAhead of trial, Google had said Singular had requested up to $7 billion in monetary damages for infringing its two patents. At trial, Timbers said Google should pay $1.67 billion.\n\nGoogle introduced its processing units in 2016 to power AI used for speech recognition, content generation, ad recommendation and other functions. Singular said that versions 2 and 3 of the units, introduced in 2017 and 2018, violate its patent rights.\n\nA U.S. appeals court in Washington also heard arguments on Tuesday about whether to invalidate Singular's patents in a separate case that Google appealed from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

        "content": "The S&P 500 is within striking distance of entering official bull market territory. To qualify, the index would need to rise more than 20% from its previous low and hit a new all-time high. The popular benchmark crossed the first threshold and needs to close above 4,796.56 to achieve the second. It’s within about 75 points of making it and there’s good reason to think it could happen soon.\n\nBear markets are relatively short-term events lasting about 15 months on average. Bull markets, on the other hand, are measured in years and typically run for around 36 months. The S&P 500 bottomed out on October 12, 2022 and the broad-based index has largely been running higher since.\n\nNow that we’re this close to hitting the mark, here are seven S&P 500 stocks that can keep this bull market run going.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not only the world’s largest technology company but with a $2.8 trillion market capitalization, it is the largest company period. It has a 7.4% weight in the S&P 500. Yet shares are down 8% since the middle of December as slowing sales and profit growth weighed on performance.\n\nThe centerpiece of its business is the iPhone, which accounts for 52% of total sales. Revenue hit a new record in the fourth quarter but growth was a paltry 2.8%. For the full year, revenue was actually down 2.4%. All other Apple products such as Macs, iPads and wearables, were also lower from the year-ago period.\n\nSo why will Apple keep growing? Services continue to light up sales growth. Revenue jumped 16% in the fourth quarter, an acceleration from previous periods. Although it’s about half the size of the iPhone segment, it’s going to eventually become Apple’s biggest business. From the App Store to Apple Music, Apple Pay to iCloud, Apple is pulling in money left and right. It’s also hugely profitable.\n\nWhere product gross margins were north of 32%, service gross margins were 70.9%, up 40 basis points sequentially. Apple’s massive installed base of products ensures services revenue will keep growing. There will be hiccups in the tech giant’s performance from time to time but the overall trend is up. Apple is a key driver for keeping this bull market going.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) The Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL) logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nBest known as the parent company of search engine Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also the world’s largest online advertising platform. Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, Google Cloud, and other products and services all contribute to propping up the ad business. Alphabet generated $59.6 billion in ad revenue in just the third quarter of 2023 or 78% of the total.\n\nSearch naturally is the primary driver of revenue, representing 74% of total sales. There had been concern that companies dependent on online advertising would get hit by a recession as businesses reined in spending. While that’s likely true for smaller outfits, businesses also know that if they want to reach consumers they need to be on Alphabet’s platforms. It is facing competition from other ad outlets, including Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Facebook, but Google is still the dominant player in the space. It still owns 85% of the global search market.\n\nYet the future for Alphabet is much more than search. Google Cloud is the third largest cloud services platform, Android has a 70% share of the mobile market, Gmail is the de facto email service, and so forth. Alphabet also promises to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI). It claims its generative AI model Gemini is the “largest, most capable and most general” AI system. The Pixel 8 Pro smartphone is the first smartphone to be powered by AI. Expect Alphabet to be front and center in the bull market.\n\nPaycom Software (PAYC)\n\nSource: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cloud-based payroll company, Paycom Software (NASDAQ:PAYC) provides payroll, talent acquisition, time and labor management, and other business solutions. But after racing higher across the first half of 2023, Paycom stock fell off the table. From peak to trough it lost over 60% of its value in just three months. Now it’s climbing higher once more.\n\nPaycom’s Beti software is a paradigm shift in how payroll services are performed. Employees themselves do their own payroll helping to eliminate errors. It’s proving so popular that two-thirds of Paycom’s customers have switched to Beti. Third-quarter revenue was up 22% year over year as customers realized they were saving money from “perfect” payrolls.\n\nThe one problem is that businesses are becoming so efficient and proficient at using Beti they are eliminating certain billable items. That’s hurting Payocm’s growth rate at the moment, and led to disappointing guidance for the rest of 2023 and 2024. However, it should make for satisfied customers who return again and again in the future.\n\nPaycom’s financial foundation remains solid and the modest dividend it initiated last year remains secure. There is plenty of room for future growth from the payout. Particularly as the market picks up steam, the cloud-based payroll company should thrive.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity specialist Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) enjoys the peace of mind that comes from knowing your business will always be needed. Data breaches were expected to hit a record last year and will likely continue being a menace going forward. Fortinet’s enterprise-class, service-provider and government-organization clients can also be at ease with its network security, cloud security, and endpoint security services. Its Security Fabric platform for example, enables customers to achieve higher levels of security, performance, and efficiency while reducing complexity and costs.\n\nAI is also expected to play a large role in protecting against cyber threats. Fortinet invested heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities to enhance its threat detection, prevention, and response solutions. It also staked out a leadership position in firewalls and software-defined wide area networks, or SD-WANs, that connect data centers to branches and the cloud.\n\nAs more customers shift their data and operations to the cloud, the need for security increases, not lessens. By expanding its product portfolio to meet customer demand, Fortinet can further increase its market share while revenue and profits grow.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) Deck of a Royal Caribbean (RCL) cruise ship looking over the ocean\n\nSource: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter nearly capsizing four years ago in the wake of the pandemic, Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) is back sailing the high seas. Shares more than doubled over the past year, far outstripping the returns of the index. Revenue is at record levels and the cruise line operator boasts occupancy rates comparable to pre-Covid levels despite prices rising.\n\nDespite this, Royal Caribbean trades at just 13 times earnings estimates and just 13 times free cash flow. It is more heavily indebted than it was before the global health crisis four years ago, but that was necessary to stay afloat. It is back to earning plenty of profit and generating cash flow to pay that down.\n\nThat’s not to say it might now encounter a rogue wave or two. The conflict in Israel will likely cause a small hit to its performance. The cruise line noted 1.5% of its fourth quarter capacity was to Israel. However, many of those voyages have been diverted elsewhere. The recent Red Sea attacks by Yemeni militants attacking ships could make travel there too dangerous as well. Commercial ships are already rerouting from the area.

Its stock is up 115% in the last 12 months. The industry is expected to grow from $156 billion in 2022 to $425 billion in 2030 for a near-14% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nThe cybersecurity leader’s fiscal year 2023 revenue soared 25% to $6.9 billion and turned in a $440 million profit. That’s a complete reversal from the year-ago period when it suffered losses of $267 million. It’s continuing that strong growth in fiscal 2024 with fourth quarter revenue up 20% while profits grew nearly 10-fold. Chairman and CEO ​​Nikesh Arora says the performance was driven by “An unprecedented level of attacks is fueling strong demand in the cybersecurity market.”\n\nIt is also investing in AI-powered solutions. Its Cortex platform now has 5,300 customers, a 25% increase in the quarter. It was also the only platform to achieve a 100% detection and protection in comprehensive industry evaluations called MITRE 5.\n\nBecause like death and taxes, cybercrime will always be with us, Palo Alto Networks will keep driving the bull market forward.\n\nModerna (MRNA) Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is currently best known for its Spikevax Covid therapeutic. But the biotech also delivers treatments for various other diseases, such as cancer and rare genetic disorders. While Covid shots are a much harder sell these days, Moderna has a 48% share of the U.S. market. It did have $6.7 billion worth of Covid product sales last year, however. Now it is preparing to launch another product, a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. There are nine other late-stage programs in development.\n\nThat gives Moderna the confidence to predict it will return to organic sales growth in 2025. It also expects to break even in 2026.  It says product launches and disciplined investment will help sales steadily grow going forward as it launches as many as 15 new products over the next five years. One of the more promising developments is its personalized cancer vaccine mRNA-4157, which it is collaborating with Merck (NYSE:MRK) on.\n\nModerna’s stock was a laggard in 2023 as Covid-related Spikevax sales collapsed 71%. As that’s it’s only commercial product on the market it’s not surprising the stock tumbled hard. Yet its RSV vaccine is moving towards commercialization in early 2024 and its other therapies are progressing through trials. The market is warming up to the stock once again. Expect Moderna to keep growing as more products hit the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Netflix downgraded, Alphabet initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "content": "Netflix downgraded, Alphabet initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. \r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nBernstein upgraded Domino's Pizza(DPZ) to Market Perform from Underperform with a price target of $370, up from $330, as it believes 2024 will be the first \"normal\" year for restaurants since 2019. Despite continued skepticism on the pizza category outlook, the near-term setup for 2024 has turned attractive and there are no immediate catalysts that could materially pressure Domino's, the firm adds. Morgan Stanley upgraded Crowdstrike (CRWD) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $304, up from $203. The firm sees an improving demand outlook for Crowdstrike as accelerating cyberattacks, multiple new products and generative artificial intelligence tailwinds should drive estimates upside.  BofA upgraded United Airlines(UAL) to Buy from Underperform with a price target of $56, up from $40, given strong balance sheet execution despite high capex, steady demand and what it calls a \"favorable valuation.\" MoffettNathanson upgraded Paramount (PARA) to Neutral from Sell with a $13 price target. The \"will they, won't they\" story of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Paramount and Comcast (CMCSA) \"has captivated,\" says the firm, with consensus seeming certain that the media assets of at least two of these three companies \"will emerge out of 2024 hitched together in one way or another.\" Piper Sandler upgraded GoDaddy (GDDY) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $121, up from $100, on a lower discount rate and higher terminal free cash multiple.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Netflix (NFLX) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged $500 price target. Across 2024 and 2025, the Street has lofty expectations for Netflix, but 2024 revenue estimates may be a tad too high, the firm argues. Morgan Stanley downgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $66, down from $118. The company's product evolution and progress on key strategic imperatives, such as improving Branded Checkout and expanding Venmo, which are key to supporting faster than e-commerce growth, are taking longer than initially thought, the firm says.  BofA downgraded JetBlue (JBLU) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $3, down from $6. The firm expects the most unit cost pressure from domestic airlines that have growth limitations such as JetBlue and Spirit Airlines (SAVE). BofA also downgraded Frontier Group (ULCC) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $6, down from $8.  HSBC downgraded Morgan Stanley(MS) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $96, up from $90. The firm has also cut earnings estimates notably for Morgan Stanley in recent months even as the share price has risen, leading to a material increase in the valuation despite a softening outlook for wealth management revenue.  Deutsche Bank downgraded Wells Fargo(WFC) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $51. The firm expects a weak net interest income guide for 2024 given likely lower rates and continued sluggish loan growth.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nBMO Capital initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOGL) with an Outperform rating and $170 price target, calling it the firm's 2024 Top Pick in Internet. Google has integrated machine learning into its core products since 2000 and the firm cites the company's leading position in AI in the U.S. and globally for its bullish view on the shares.  BMO Capital initiated coverage of Amazon.com (AMZN) with an Outperform rating and $200 price target. AWS will \"lead the foundational and middle layer of the gen AI/ML stack,\" while secular Cloud tailwinds will continue in 2024 and beyond, the firm tells investors, adding that on the retail side of the business, Amazon is positioned to invest in smaller same-day buildings with lower capex needs. BMO also started coverage of eBay (EBAY) and Wayfair (W) with Market Perform ratings and price targets of $49 and $57, respectively. BMO Capital initiated coverage of Meta Platforms(META) with a Market Perform rating and $397 price target. The firm advises investors to maintain positions near term, realizing likely very near-term upside from numerous favorable Q4 tailwinds, but does not recommend allocating new funds in Meta given its concerns about unforeseen growth headwinds into the second half of 2024 and beyond. BMO also started coverage of Snap (SNAP) with an Outperform rating and $22 price target, and Pinterest (PINS) with an Outperform rating and $45 price target. BMO Capital initiated coverage of Netflix (NFLX) with an Outperform rating and $566 price target. The \"visionary\" co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters position Netflix well for \"the next evolution of content creation and advertising growth,\" while $17B of content investment this year will position it well for continued market share gains relative to traditional linear TV, the firm argues.  BMO Capital initiated coverage of Electronic Arts(EA) with an Outperform rating and $160 price target. The firm says EA has one of the most valuable audiences in sports, and that it continues to believe takeover chatter will support industry share prices. BMO Capital also started coverage of DraftKings (DKNG), Roblox (RBLX), Uber Technologies (UBER) and DoorDash (DASH) with an Outperform rating and $120 price target, and Lyft (LYFT) and Instacart (CART) with Market Perform ratings and price targets of $15 and $26, respectively.",

        "title": "Forget Apple: 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks led the market in 2023, and many believe they will do it again in 2024. This cohort, headlined by the big tech stars, includes:\n\nApple Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Microsoft Nvidia Tesla\n\nApple is one of the most prominent companies within this group, especially with its consumer-facing products. It's also the world's largest company, valued at $2.87 trillion (compared to Microsoft's $2.75 trillion).\n\nHowever, I don't think it's worth the investment right now, especially when this group has three better stocks to choose from.\n\nWhy is Apple a poor investment now?\n\nYears ago, Apple's stock was reasonably valued. Now, it's not. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nApple's stock trades for around 30 times earnings -- a level reserved for perfectly executing companies growing at an above-market pace. While it's hard to dispute Apple's execution, its revenue shrank every quarter in 2023.\n\nAs a result, Apple has a long way to go to earn its valuation. However, three stocks within the Magnificent Seven are cheaper and growing faster than Apple, making them superior investments for 2024.\n\nThese investments are better and cheaper than Apple stock\n\nOf the remaining six, I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms make for stronger buys.\n\nWhile Alphabet and Meta have other investments and businesses, they are primarily advertising businesses. In late 2022 and early 2023, this industry struggled. However, in Q3, they lapped those comparisons, which allowed their ad divisions to grow much faster than in previous quarters (Meta's ad revenue grew 24% to $33.6 billion, and Alphabet's rose 9.4% to $59.6 billion).\n\nThe same tailwinds that boosted these two in Q3 will prevail throughout Q4 and 2024, setting them up for a strong year.\n\nAmazon also has an ad division, but it didn't experience the same weakness as the other two because its ad segment is relatively new (at least compared to Meta and Alphabet). However, the rise of ads and other high-margin segments marks the transition of Amazon from solely an e-commerce business to one with vital services. As a result, Amazon's gross margins have substantially risen over the past decade with AWS (its cloud computing division), ad services, subscriptions, and third-party seller services.\n\nStory continues AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHigh gross margins allow for better profit margins, which have also risen alongside its gross margin. This paints an optimal picture for Amazon, as it is finally turning the corner to become a consistently profitable business.\n\nThis is something investors haven't experienced before, making 2024 an exciting year for Amazon.\n\nWith these three, there is a lot of excitement and buzz about what 2024 could be. With Apple, the consensus is: \"I hope the iPhone weakness doesn't get worse.\" I prefer to invest in more optimistic companies, making these three no-brainers compared to Apple.\n\nThey're also priced a lot more competitively. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFrom a forward-looking perspective, Meta and Alphabet are far cheaper than Apple. Historically, these two have traded around the same range as Apple, which means their stocks are slated for strong growth in 2024.\n\nAmazon is much harder to compare because it's in an entirely different business and hasn't had a full year of optimized profits. However, if you consider analyst revenue estimates for Amazon's 2024 fiscal year, and if the company can pull off an 8.5% profit margin for the entire year, it will produce nearly $50 billion in profits. With Amazon's current market cap, that would price the stock at 31 times 2024 earnings, which is still more expensive than Apple's valuation.\n\nHowever, that's a short-term view, as Amazon is just starting its optimization journey. As a result, I still think Amazon will outperform Apple by a wide margin over the next few years and could increase its profit margin even more.\n\nApple may have been the stock to own over the past decade, but there are much better options now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Opinion: Why pushing STEM majors is turning out to be a terrible investment",
        "content": "Company bikes sit outside an office building on Google's Mountain View campus. Tech jobs are often sold as being for young, happy-go-lucky STEM workers, but the reality is different. (Brian Contreras / Los Angeles Times)\n\nRepublicans and Democrats don’t seem to agree on much these days. But despite the gridlock in Congress, both political parties have for years supported spending billions on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education. Their goals include reducing perceived shortages of STEM workers, boosting American innovation and competitiveness and diversifying this highly paid workforce. The message of lucrative STEM careers appears to have reached students and tuition-paying parents — the number of STEM majors has surged in recent years.\n\nBut there is a problem with these massive investments: Most STEM graduates don’t work in STEM occupations. The Census Bureau reported in 2021 that a paltry 28% of STEM grads are working in these supposedly in-demand, highly paid and important STEM jobs. These include diverse sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals and energy, but about half of STEM jobs are in computers, and tech firms typically complain the loudest of STEM shortages.\n\nRead more:Still hiring: Big Tech layoffs give other sectors an opening\n\nWhat’s causing this disconnect? It’s pretty straightforward: Employers, and the investors who drive their behavior, depress the national returns on STEM education investments.\n\nOne key factor is wages. Many able STEM grads bolt for better-paying careers, especially in business, finance, management and medicine (government programs focused on STEM exclude medical practitioners and are not designed to increase those numbers). Some do find high salaries in STEM jobs, many right out of college, especially in hot fields such as AI. But STEM grads even in the most dynamic sectors, including computer science and engineering, see their salary advantage fade over time, increasing the odds that they’ll leave for greener pastures.\n\nIt is employers, of course, who set wages at their firms, and current wage levels are not keeping most STEM grads in STEM jobs. Some of the wealthiest companies — Apple, Google, Adobe Systems and Intel — settled a class-action lawsuit for $415 million in 2015 after workers alleged employers used illegal means to prevent salary increases. Employers also incentivize moves from technical work to management with higher salaries at their own firms, yet many bemoan a shortage of technical STEM workers, not managers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSTEM grads may also flee the “burn-and-churn” management common in STEM jobs. We’ve been bombarded by images of young, happy-go-lucky STEM workers playing foosball and skateboarding to free snacks or meditation pods. But the more common experience, especially in tech, is grueling “crunch time” to rush a product out the door while worrying about the next performance review.\n\nRead more:Editorial: The demise of liberal arts? Students lose when colleges trade humanities for STEM\n\nMedia accounts of the most famous companies describe workplaces that are aggressive, both for employees and for the “shadow workforce” toiling on short-term contracts. This work stress affects both physical and mental health. Employees at Uber, Facebook and Google have taken their own lives, prompting discussion of the role of workplace culture in their deaths.\n\nAdding to the stress is the constant threat of layoffs. Even the richest firms regularly shed STEM workers as technologies or markets change or investors demand cost reductions. When Elon Musk took over Twitter and sacked more than half the workforce, other CEOs cheered. Musk was hardly a STEM trailblazer; workers in the high-demand field of IT are more likely to face layoffs than workers in most other industries. Especially vulnerable are expensive older workers and those who didn’t, or couldn’t, self-train to keep their skills relevant — an increasingly important practice because employer-provided training has dwindled over recent decades.\n\nEmployers facing STEM shortages should bend over backwards to keep their scarce talent. Instead, research finds that STEM employers maintain unwelcoming environments for older workers as well as women and underrepresented minorities. Sheryl Sandberg, the former COO of Facebook (now Meta), blamed Facebook’s dearth of female software developers on universities and society for not graduating more female computer science and engineering majors. But why would women choose a sector where the numbers indicate they aren’t welcome? Where even blatant sexual harassment can go unpunished?\n\nSome STEM grads also reject STEM jobs because so many are meaningless or even harmful. Workers have fled social media companies following concerns that they spread misinformation, erode democracy and foster teen depression. Fossil fuel companies struggle for STEM talent due to their damage to the planet. Trillion-dollar tech companies are often accused of unfair trade practices and “surveillance capitalism” that mines users for personal data. STEM grads who want to make the world a better place may struggle to find a fit.\n\nThe poor return on investments in STEM education can improve. Employers facing STEM worker shortages must understand that their wounds are self-inflicted. They can raise wages, utilize worker-friendly management, re-train obsolete workers rather than lay them off, follow best practices on workplace inclusiveness and eschew destructive business models.\n\nBut investors repeatedly reward employers for treating STEM grads like fast fashion — discarded when broken or no longer appealing — or for deploying STEM skills in lucrative yet harmful business models. A better return on STEM education will require corporations to move away from maximizing short-term shareholder value and consider more stakeholders and moral limits on money making. Meanwhile, governments can lure investors to put more money in planet-saving technologies, as Congress did with the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nWithout these or similar shifts, STEM majors will continue to be oversold.\n\nJohn D.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Alphabet",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry exploded last year, with excitement over the technology unlikely to dissipate in 2024. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least the end of the decade, which would see it surpass a value of $1 trillion.\n\nThere's no better time to consider investing in the booming sector and potentially profiting from its long-term growth. Two of the most attractive options are Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). These companies are developing the hardware and software fueling the AI market's growth, and could deliver stellar gains over the next decade.\n\nLet's take a closer look at these companies and determine whether Nvidia or Alphabet is currently the better AI stock.\n\nNvidia\n\nWhether you've been following the boom in AI closely or have just glimpsed the occasional headline, chances are you know about Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last year. Since last January the company's shares soared 245% as its chips became the preferred hardware for AI developers worldwide.\n\nGraphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's are crucial to training and running AI models. As a result, demand for the chips skyrocketed in 2023 as countless companies pivoted their businesses to developing the segment. Nvidia's years of dominance in the GPU market allowed it to get a head start in AI, while rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have yet to catch up.\n\nAlongside a rising stock price, Nvidia's success in AI has seen its earnings reach new heights. In the third quarter of 2024 (which ended October 2023), the tech giant's revenue increased by 206% year over year as operating income climbed 1,600%. The growth was mainly thanks to a 279% rise in data centers, which profited from a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nNvidia will need to contend with increased chip competition in the coming months. However, the market's growth potential suggests there will be room for the company to retain its dominance and welcome newcomers, making this stock an attractive way to invest in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhile Nvidia is excelling in hardware, Alphabet has significant potential on the software side of AI. The company ramped up its expansion in the industry last year, launching its own version of OpenAI's ChatGPT in February called Bard, adding new AI tools on Google Cloud, and unveiling a highly anticipated AI model named Gemini in December.\n\nPopular brands like Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google have seen Alphabet attract a massive user base. In fact, the company is home to at least nine products with more than 1 billion users. Alphabet has used the popularity of its services to build a lucrative digital advertising business, with the company responsible for about 25% of the $740 billion market.\n\nHowever, the tech giant's substantial user base also strengthens its prospects in AI. An advanced AI model like Gemini could allow Alphabet to offer more efficient advertising, create a responsive search experience, and better analyze viewing trends on YouTube to improve video recommendations.\n\nAlphabet hit nearly $77 billion in free cash flow last year, more than cloud competitors Microsoft or Amazon. As a result, the company has the financial resources to continue investing in AI and flourish over the long term.\n\nIs Nvidia or Alphabet the better AI stock?\n\nNvidia and Alphabet will likely enjoy major gains from AI, with both looking like attractive stocks to hold for several years. However, EPS estimates suggest Nvidia might have more growth potential in the short term. GOOGL EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThese charts show how Alphabet's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share, while Nvidia's might achieve $24 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying those figures by each company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (Alphabet's 21 and Nvidia's 40) yields a stock price of $168 for Alphabet and $960 for Nvidia.\n\nLooking at their current positions, the projections would see Alphabet's stock rise about 24% and Nvidia's 96% in two years. As a result, despite its meteoric rise last year, Nvidia still has much to offer new investors, and is likely the better AI stock right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "California wants to reduce traffic. The Newsom administration thinks AI can help",
        "content": "Caltrans is asking technology companies if artificial intelligence can be used to reduce traffic in California. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBeing stuck in traffic is a familiar problem for many Californians, but state officials want to harness the power of artificial intelligence to discover new solutions.\n\nThe California Department of Transportation, teaming up with other state agencies, is asking technology companies by Jan. 25 to propose generative AI tools that could help California reduce traffic and make roads safer, especially for pedestrians, cyclists and scooter riders. Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can quickly produce text, images and other content, but the technology can also help workers brainstorm ideas.\n\nThe request shows how California is trying to tap into AI to improve government services at a time when lawmakers seek to safeguard against the technology’s potential risks. As Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and other tech giants roll out new AI-powered tools, the technology’s rapid pace of advancement has raised concerns about misinformation, job displacement, copyright infringement and privacy.\n\nRead more:Worried about AI? How California lawmakers plan to tackle the technology's risks in 2024\n\nThe state's plan to potentially use artificial intelligence to help alleviate traffic jams stems from an executive order that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in September about generative AI. As part of the order, the state also released a report outlining the benefits and risks of using AI in state government.\n\nCalifornia state agencies have access to a trove of valuable data, including from thousands of traffic sensors and cameras. Analyzing that data to quickly reduce traffic and improve safety can be challenging. The huge volume of data comes in various forms, such as photos, videos and text.\n\nThe state currently uses technology to help analyze traffic data, but the agencies rely heavily on workers to decide what to do to improve the flow of traffic in real time. Generative AI could come up with better solutions.\n\n\"It probably would change the strategy much, much faster than a human being will be able to do,\" said Amy Tong, secretary of government operations for California.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are many reasons why traffic jams happen, including crashes, debris in the roadway, major events that draw big crowds and bad weather. But there are also recurring issues that can make roads more congested, said California Secretary of Transportation Toks Omishakin.\n\nFor example, a narrow part of a road could hinder the flow of traffic. Workers could use generative AI to brainstorm solutions.\n\n\"There's potential for generative AI to actually help us better funnel traffic through those areas, instead of automatically thinking 'Oh, let's just widen the road. That's the solution,'\" he said.\n\nCaltrans also wants to use generative AI to help achieve its vision of having zero road fatalities and serious injuries by 2050. Through analysis of crash sites, lighting conditions, traffic patterns and behavior of “vulnerable roadway users” such as pedestrians and cyclists, Caltrans says AI could help workers identify areas that are at higher risk for accidents and suggest safety measures.\n\n“This proactive approach will enable transportation system operators and engineers to anticipate and address safety issues in advance or more quickly, rather than merely reacting to them after the fact,” a document outlining the problem Caltrans is trying to solve states.\n\nAs technology becomes more incorporated in state government work, Omishakin said he anticipates jobs will change but not be entirely replaced.\n\nCompanies are already using AI to analyze traffic patterns and the movement of people on the roads, including drivers and bicyclists. Google, for example, has a research initiative known as Project Green Light that cities such as Seattle are participating in that aims to improve the flow of traffic and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars on the road. As part of the project, Google uses AI to identify when engineers can adjust the timing of traffic lights and provides those recommendations to city officials.\n\nINRIX, a transportation analytics company, announced a new generative AI-powered product in November that could help cities better manage the flow of traffic. A report by the company found that Los Angeles in 2022 was the 6th-most congested city in the United States with delays costing drivers, on average, 95 lost hours and $1,601.\n\nTechnology also isn't perfect and humans need to be in the mix to ensure that the AI system is using data from the right sources and not spewing out errors, Tong said. The state is also taking steps to limit potential data security and privacy issues. State data that vendors use in the AI systems have to be stored within Caltrans' \"managed cloud environments,\" according to a document about the state proposal.\n\nThe state's request for innovative ideas involves various steps that include the state evaluating the solutions the companies suggest. California, which faces a record $68-billion budget deficit, may then award a contract to companies. Other state agencies are also planning to ask businesses to provide ideas to help improve other state services, including call centers that help taxpayers, Tong said.\n\n\"We definitely have the budget constraint in mind, but at the same time, public safety is a high priority for the administration,\" Tong said. \"So that's why we continue to explore these options.\"\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

        "title": "Amazon Has Wall Street Seeing Return to Record Stock Price",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Amazon.com Inc. shares are poised to resume their gains after a rough start to 2024, putting the stock on track for a long-awaited return to record high levels posted more than two years ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Key Piece of Boeing 737 Found in Hunt for Clues on Blowout China Says It Caught Foreign Consultant Spying for UK’s MI6\n\nThat, at least, is the view among analysts, with some 97% of those tracked by Bloomberg recommending the cloud-computing and e-commerce giant’s shares. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are among firms naming it their top e-commerce or internet stock for 2024, while Oppenheimer and Roth MKM crowned it their favorite large-cap choice.\n\nIt’s the kind of bullish consensus that might raise alarm bells for some contrarians, especially after the shares surged 81% last year, the most since 2015. The stock was among the hardest hit of the big tech firms in last week’s declines, although it fared better than Apple Inc.\n\nConfidence is high in Amazon’s profit outlook, partly because of AI tailwinds. The average analyst price target suggests upside of roughly 25%, which would return Amazon close to its all-time closing high from July 2021. Among megacaps, only Nvidia Corp. boasts a better return potential, as the Street sees it.\n\n“I think this year you’ll get Amazon breaching its previous high,” said Andrew Slimmon, who holds the shares in portfolios he oversees at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “The stock is not expensive relative to its history, it is beating numbers, and consensus estimates are rising. That’s a recipe for a bull market.”\n\nAmazon has gone the longest among the so-called Magnificent Seven without posting a record, in contrast to Apple, Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia, all of which set new highs last year. The seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 Index by market value — a group that also includes Google parent Alphabet Inc., Tesla Inc. and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc., have mostly faltered in January, after driving the market’s strength last year. Amazon’s 3.3% drop is among the steepest of the group.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Magnificent Seven Loses Importance as Soft Landing Means Risk On\n\nAnalysts recommend Amazon for a slew of reasons, but most cite better growth trends and improving margins, especially as the company reaps the benefit from investments it made during the pandemic. Artificial intelligence is also expected to lift demand for its cloud business.\n\nConsensus expectations for Amazon’s net 2024 earnings have risen 18% over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, even as the view for revenue has held flat. Amazon’s most recent results, in October, showed robust growth in both earnings and sales, in particular its cloud business.\n\nValuation Appeal\n\nThe improving profit picture has helped boost Amazon’s appeal on a valuation basis. The stock trades at 32 times estimated earnings, and while that’s above the multiple of 23.9 for the Nasdaq 100 Index, it’s well below Amazon’s 10-year average of 57.\n\nNeedham & Co. touted valuation as a selling point. The firm named Amazon its second-favorite — after Alphabet — for 2024 among the former FAANG group of companies, which also include Meta, Apple and Netflix Inc.\n\nIts analysis “concludes that investors are getting AMZN’s core e-commerce business for free,” analyst Laura Martin wrote last month.\n\nAmazon is a perennial top pick for analysts. Goldman Sachs, Mizuho Securities, and Wells Fargo & Co. all named it as such at various points in 2023. While those bulls have been rewarded over the long-term, buy ratings don’t necessarily translate into superior performance: Amazon’s roughly 80% gain over the past five years compares with a 150% advance in the Nasdaq 100 for the same period.\n\nAndrew Huang, a portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management, is among those expecting improving margins and cloud demand to support the stock in 2024, while a low valuation relative to its history diminishes downside risk.\n\nHowever, he said, the near-unanimous bullishness could be a contrarian indicator.\n\n“If everyone is expecting another good year after last year’s rally, that could mean it is a time to trim your position, because the stock could take a hit on even a slight disappointment,” he said.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple shares have dropped about 6% to start the year, with a pair of analyst downgrades underlining concerns about the strength of the company’s key iPhone business. Both Piper Sandler and Barclays lowered their view on the stock, resulting in a consensus rating — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell views on the stock — of 4.04 out of five, the lowest for the stock since October 2020.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple’s iPhone sales slump in China is deepening and the company is likely to see volumes decline further this year, according to Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee. Elon Musk’s drug use has worried executives and board members at businesses he runs, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the billionaire and the companies. Samsung Electronics Co. likely managed to stem revenue and operating profit slides during the fourth quarter, affirming expectations that chip and electronics demand will gradually recover in 2024. Global technology giants including Amazon, Alphabet’s Google and Microsoft are among firms working to ramp up their presence in Saudi Arabia amid pressure from the government, which has said it will stop giving contracts to companies without regional headquarters in the country. Meituan has become Hong Kong’s second-largest food delivery platform since debuting in the city last May, a sign that splashy subsidies are boosting the company’s first major foray outside mainland China.\n\n(Updates shares in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump’s?

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Despite economic uncertainty, Wall Street delivered phenomenal returns to patient investors in 2023. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite rallied 24% and 43%, respectively, by the time the curtain closed.\n\nAlthough the rally became a bit more broad-based in the final two months of the year, the outperformance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is widely credited with lifting the broader market higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to what have consistently been the seven largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. by market cap:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nApple clocked in as the \"worst\" of the bunch with a 48% return in 2023, while Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia rallied 102%, 194%, and 239%, respectively. AAPL Chart\n\nWhat investors seem to appreciate about the Magnificent Seven stocks is their undeniable competitive advantages.\n\nApple's iPhone is responsible for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share, and its share repurchase program is unmatched by other public companies. Microsoft's Windows is still the undisputed leader in desktop operating systems, while Azure has gobbled up a 25% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Alphabet's Google accounted for close to 92% of worldwide internet search share in December. Meanwhile, streaming platform YouTube (also owned by Alphabet) attracts more than 2.7 billion unique viewers each month. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brings in an estimated 40% of U.S. online retail sales, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) leading the world in cloud infrastructure service spending share (31%), as of the third quarter. Nvidia is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nvidia may account for more than 90% of all graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers in 2024. Meta Platforms owns the world's top social media \"real estate.\" Facebook is the most-visited site globally, with WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger collectively (with Facebook) attracting close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's comfortably reached recurring profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn spite of these competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven stocks could differ dramatically in the new year. Whereas one Magnificent Seven stock is effectively cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company, another expensive highflier appears poised for a reality check.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in 2024: Amazon\n\nAmong the seven industry titans listed above, the one investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024, and likely hold for many years to come, is e-commerce company Amazon.\n\nThe biggest potential headwind for Amazon in the new year is the possibility of a U.S. recession taking shape. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggest a downturn is likely. Since Amazon generates so much of its revenue from its online marketplace, a recession would be expected to slow consumer spending.\n\nBut there are two important things to understand about this headwind for Amazon. First, recessions are historically short-lived. Only three of 12 U.S. recessions following World War II have surpassed 12 months, and none have made it past 18 months. Betting on economic expansion has always been a winning move for patient investors.\n\nSecondly, but most important, Amazon generates very little of its operating cash flow and operating income from its mammoth online marketplace. Even if online retail sales were to taper a bit, it would likely have a negligible impact on the company's cash flow and bottom line.\n\nWhat can carry Amazon's stock to new highs in 2024 is the company's high-growth ancillary operating segments, which are led by AWS.\n\nAs noted, AWS accounts for nearly a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending. Cloud service margins can run circles around the razor-thin margins associated with online retail sales. As a result, AWS is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income despite generating only a sixth of the company's net sales. With enterprise cloud-service spending still ramping up, AWS looks to have a long runway of double-digit growth ahead of it.\n\nDon't overlook Amazon's advertising services segment, either. This is a company that's drawing more than 2 billion people to its site on a monthly basis, many of which are motivated shoppers. This puts the ball in Amazon's court when it comes to ad-pricing power. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered at least 21% year-over-year constant-currency sales growth over the past eight quarters (two years).\n\nAlthough some fundamentally focused investors are going to be turned off by Amazon's astronomical trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 75, the traditional P/E ratio is a terrible way to value cutting-edge companies like Amazon that are reinvesting the bulk of their operating cash flow back into their business. Valuing Amazon relative to its cash flow is, therefore, a much smarter approach.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Amazon was regularly valued at a multiple of 23 to 37 times cash flow. It can be scooped up right now for less than 13 times forecast cash flow in 2024. With the exception of the 2022 bear market, it's the cheapest Amazon has traded, relative to its future cash flow, since going public in 1997. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Nvidia\n\nOn the other side of the coin, semiconductor giant Nvidia has all the hallmarks of a stock to avoid like the plague in 2024.\n\nI'll absolutely give Nvidia credit where credit is due for more than tripling in value last year. With interest in AI soaring, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs quickly became staples in AI-accelerated data centers. Considering that chip fabrication juggernaut Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is significantly beefing up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble delivering more of its AI-driven GPUs in the quarters to come.\n\nSo, what's the problem? Pricing power, growing competition, regulatory headwinds, and history all come to mind.\n\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ends later this month, the company's sales are expected to climb by approximately 119% from the previous year. Almost the entirety of this growth can be traced to the company's GPUs from its data-center segment. More specifically, it's being driven by jaw-dropping pricing power.\n\nThrough the first six months of fiscal 2024, Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined from the prior-year period. Through the first nine months, it's only jumped by an aggregate of 20%. What this tells investors is that A100 and H100 scarcity is what's driven Nvidia's sales growth. Ironically, ramping up its own production in the current calendar year is liable to sap its pricing power and adversely impact its gross margin.\n\nTo build on this point, competition in AI-focused GPUs is bound to pick up. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to roll it out in a big way throughout 2024. Likewise, Intel plans to bring its Falcon Shores GPU to market as a direct competitor to Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips in 2025. This should provide further downside pressure on Nvidia's pricing power.\n\nRegulators are doing Nvidia no favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have imposed restrictions on AI-GPU exports to China. This is a potentially big blow to Nvidia, which regularly generates between 20% and 25% of its sales from the world's No. 2 global economy by gross domestic product.\n\nLastly, history could be Nvidia's worst enemy in the new year. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years that's avoided an initial bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have a tendency to overestimate the adoption/uptake of new innovations without giving them the proper time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to the rule, which could sink Nvidia's proverbial ship in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Coming: 1 Stock Split AI Stock to Buy in 2024 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "It is impossible to predict the future of the stock market. However, certain patterns tend to repeat over time. For example, since 1971 the NASDAQ Composite has surged an average of 19% every year following a bear market rebound like the one we experienced in 2023. If that pattern holds, investors could be on the cusp of another bull run.\n\nLet's explore why the tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) could be a great way to bet on a continued market rally, especially as it invests in new growth opportunities related to generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nFresh off a massive stock split\n\nIn July 2022, Alphabet completed a massive 20-for-one stock split that took its stock price to around $110 per share. The move came at a difficult time for the company as rising interest rates and fears of a U.S. recession put a damper on the digital advertising industry, which makes up roughly 80% of its revenue. The good news is that these macroeconomic issues could fade as inflation falls and the market becomes more optimistic that the Federal Reserve will ease its hawkish monetary policy.\n\nWhile Google's economic moat in internet search remains rock-solid thanks to its strong algorithm and network effects, the company is also exploring new growth drivers that could help diversify its business. AI seems to be one of its most promising opportunities.\n\nThe generative AI opportunity\n\nWhen the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022, it looked like a Google killer because of its ability to answer user questions in an informative and conversational way. But the threat was overblown.\n\nAlphabet quickly released its own AI capabilities through Bard and Google search AI, which benefit from its treasure trove of data and ability to search the internet in real time. The company successfully shored up its economic moat in internet search, while also creating more opportunities to collect valuable user data. But its enterprise-focused efforts might have an even bigger impact.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn December, Alphabet launched Gemini, its most powerful AI model, which will power its consumer-facing apps and be licensed to Google Cloud customers who want to build their own applications. This model could have use cases ranging from customer service bots to product recommendations and text summaries. Google is also investing in proprietary AI hardware, such as its next-generation TPU v5p chip, designed to be a cost-effective way to train AI models.\n\nAll in all, Alphabet's AI efforts could generate growth and help the company diversify its business model away from just digital advertising.\n\nA very affordable valuation\n\nAlphabet is a massive blue-chip company, so investors shouldn't expect it to post an earth-shattering growth rate going forward. With that said, its stock is very affordable from a valuation perspective.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21, shares trade at a sharp discount to the NASDAQ average of 29. This makes Alphabet shares a great way for value-oriented investors to bet on a bull market in 2024 as its new AI growth drivers scale up and macroeconomic challenges like high interest rates ease.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Stock a Buy for 2024?",
        "content": "Many tech stocks went up during 2023 thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Among them was Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), which uses AI across a number of products, including its ubiquitous Google search engine.\n\nAlphabet's fortunes switched from its stock hitting a 52-week low of $84.86 last January, to a 52-week high of $142.68 by the day after Christmas. So what's in store for 2024?\n\nWell, the new year is already shaping up to be an interesting one for the company. Alphabet faces some potentially major upheavals in 2024, and these factors can affect the decision to invest in Alphabet. So it's prudent to review these events to determine if Alphabet is a stock to buy in the new year.\n\nAlphabet's \"Chrome-ageddon\"\n\nOne key factor that could affect Alphabet shares is the company's decision to phase out third-party cookies from its popular Chrome web browser. These cookies are used by advertisers to target you with digital ads based on your activities on the internet, such as the websites you visited.\n\nThis online tracking raised consumer privacy concerns. So Alphabet decided to move away from third-party cookies, which would eliminate the current targeting mechanism advertisers rely on.\n\nIt's such a big deal, many in the advertising industry call this end to third-party cookies \"Chrome-ageddon\" because Chrome is the world's top-ranked web browser, commanding about a 64% market share. Apple's Safari browser is in second place, with a 20% share.\n\nAlphabet kicks off a months-long process of gradually phasing out third-party cookies in the first quarter of 2024. The company is transitioning Chrome to the Privacy Sandbox, a system Google developed.\n\nThe Privacy Sandbox limits sharing information about your online activity with third parties. Instead, the data stays on the device you're using, and is accessed by websites or apps you visit to serve you ads targeted to your interests. In this way, Privacy Sandbox tries to balance consumer and advertiser needs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis also means Alphabet will possess oversight of the data collected from Chrome users, giving it a potent incentive for advertisers to continue spending their budgets with the company. A successful transition to Privacy Sandbox is important because advertising accounted for $59.6 billion of Alphabet's $76.7 billion in Q3 revenue.\n\nAfter Privacy Sandbox is in place, it could strengthen Alphabet's economic moat in the digital advertising industry. After all, advertisers would be hard-pressed to skip running ads on the company's globally popular products, such as Google and YouTube.\n\nAlphabet's other 2024 challenge\n\nHowever, Google's search engine supremacy drew the attention of the U.S. Justice Department, which brought an antitrust lawsuit against the company. The suit focuses on Alphabet's payments to companies, such as Apple, to make Google the default search engine on their platforms.\n\nThe trial is ongoing, with closing arguments scheduled for May. The outcome could range from a fine to Alphabet being forced to restructure its business.\n\nAlphabet recently lost a separate antitrust lawsuit related to its Android mobile app store. But these sales accounted for only a portion of Google's other, non-advertising revenue, which brought in $8.3 billion in Q3, far less than the $44 billion Google's search engine advertising delivered.\n\nYet the case against Google's search dominance may not bring grim tidings. Microsoft underwent a similar antitrust lawsuit in 1998 over payments to internet service providers to boost adoption of its Internet Explorer browser. The company reached a settlement. Since then, Microsoft's stock price has increased over the years.\n\nSo if Alphabet can also achieve a settlement in its antitrust case, its business could remain prosperous in the long run. The company is doing well, as its Q3 revenue of $76.7 billion represents an 11% year-over-year increase.\n\nDeciding on Alphabet stock\n\nAlphabet's transition from third-party cookies and the antitrust lawsuit against Google may deliver a bumpy ride for its stock price in 2024. Yet over the long term, Alphabet remains a compelling growth investment.\n\nIts 11% year-over-year Q3 sales increase is complemented by strong financials. The company's Q3 assets totaled $396.7 billion, with $119.9 billion of that in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Contrast this with total liabilities of $123.5 billion.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet benefits from the booming global digital advertising industry, estimated to rise from 2023's $680 billion to $966 billion by 2028. The company also possesses other growth engines, including its cloud computing business, Google Cloud.\n\nNow, AI offers Alphabet another avenue of revenue expansion. The AI industry is forecasted to balloon 20-fold by 2030. So buying and holding Alphabet stock long term makes sense, since any price fluctuations in 2024 can pale compared to the company's revenue growth opportunities over the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in January",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are plentiful in the market. While there may not be many \"pure plays\" available, several companies have AI solutions that are deeply integrated, making them great AI investments. These are the companies I like to focus my AI investments on because they aren't an all-or-nothing pick on AI proliferation.\n\nAmong the stocks I think are solid picks are Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). This trio has a strong chance to outperform the broader market through 2024 and beyond, making them great buys today.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nWhile Nvidia has gotten a lot of attention for its \"picks and shovels\" AI investment (when a company sells the tools needed to operate), Super Micro Computer (often referred to as Supermicro) is also a solid choice in this space. Supermicro sells highly configurable servers needed to run heavy workloads like AI applications.\n\nSupermicro also has a close relationship with Nvidia, so it can squeeze the best performance out of each of Nvidia's GPUs found within these servers. With multiple companies purchasing new equipment to run these workloads, Supermicro benefits from the trend that has caused Nvidia's stock to skyrocket.\n\nThese tailwinds will benefit Supermicro in its fiscal year 2024, ending June 30, as management projects annual revenue to be about $10.5 billion, a 47% increase over fiscal year 2023. While that may not be as explosive as Nvidia's growth, Supermicro's stock is also priced cheaply, trading for just 16 times forward earnings. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nSuper Micro Computer represents an affordable alternative to Nvidia, making it a strong buy in January.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nMicrochips power the equipment used in these servers. There are only a few foundries worldwide, but the largest and most popular is Taiwan Semiconductor. Its popularity stems from its contract manufacturing status, which means it only makes chips for clients; it doesn't sell its own. As a result, Taiwan Semiconductor could be making chips side by side with a client's competitor.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor can make the smallest chips in the world, with its 3nm (nanometer) chips reaching full-scale production this year. Additionally, the next generation of chips (2nm) is slated to begin production in 2025.\n\nThat will keep Taiwan Semiconductor at the cutting edge of the semiconductor foundry companies, maintaining its competitive advantage.\n\nWhile TSMC is amid a supply glut, management believes that this downturn is nearly over, making TSMC a great pick for a recovery in 2024.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nFinally, Alphabet is one of the most popular AI investments in the market. Alphabet, better known as Google, has been at the forefront of AI investing for a long time, and investors are finally starting to see some results.\n\nRecently, Alphabet launched the latest version of its Gemini generative AI model, competing with OpenAI's GPT-4. Gemini is the first model to outperform human experts in the massive multitask language understanding test, making it the most sophisticated model available. This will allow Alphabet to monetize this model, as anyone developing a generative AI platform will want to use the most accurate tools possible.\n\nAlphabet also has a strong AI cloud computing offering in Google Cloud. Instead of purchasing a server from a company like Super Micro Computer, a company may decide to rent computing power from Alphabet. With more than 60% of the world's top 1000 largest companies and over 50% of AI start-ups using Google Cloud, it has a solid foothold in cloud computing.\n\nThis makes Alphabet a great AI investment for 2024, even if nearly 80% of Alphabet's revenue comes from advertising. But with that market slated to continue improving in 2024, Alphabet is about as no-brainer of a stock pick in 2024 as it gets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock's Recent Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?",
        "content": "Most readers would already know that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock increased by 4.4% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Alphabet's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n\n24% = US$67b ÷ US$273b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nAlphabet's Earnings Growth And 24% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Alphabet has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Alphabet's exceptional 20% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.\n\nWe then compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.2% in the same 5-year period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Alphabet Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nGiven that Alphabet doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Alphabet's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Jeff Bezos–backed AI search startup’s CEO says ‘Google is going to be viewed as something that’s legacy and old’",
        "content": "A resurfaced video making the rounds on X shows a pre-famous Jeff Bezos explaining in 1997 why he founded Amazon—namely, a “startling statistic” he came across that web usage was growing at 2,300% a year. Riding that wave by starting an online retailer made sense, he thought.\n\nNow the billionaire is making another bet on the wave of artificial intelligence, in a sector that will directly take on Google. Bezos isn’t the only major tech investor, either.\n\nFounded in August 2022, the startup known as Perplexity aims to challenge Google by offering an AI-based search engine that is “part chatbot and part search engine, offering real-time information and footnotes showing the sources of its answers,” according to its website.\n\nWhen deciding to invest, Bezos was no doubt looking at the numbers, as he did in the 1990s. Perplexity, while still not profitable, has quickly grown to 10 million monthly active users while almost entirely skipping traditional marketing, according to the company. It further claims that more than a million people have installed its mobile apps on the iOS and Android platforms, and it served over half a billion queries last year.\n\nOn Thursday, San Francisco–based Perplexity announced that it has raised $73.6 million from a group of investors led by venture capital firm IVP and including Bezos, the $1.2 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, and Shopify cofounder Tobias Lütke.\n\nPerplexity is “one of the few consumer AI products to reach this major milestone of 10 million MAUs,” said Jonathan Cohen, VP of Applied Research at Nvidia, in the announcement. AI will “transform how we access information,” he believes.\n\n\"Google is going to be viewed as something that's legacy and old,” Perplexity CEO Avarind Srinivas, a former OpenAI researcher, told Reuters this week. “Perplexity will be viewed as something that's the next generation and future.”\n\n$520 million valuation\n\nPerplexity offers a Pro version for $20 per month that allows users to pick from various large language models, among them OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude 2.1, Google's Gemini, or the venture’s own LLM Perplexity.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerplexity has a long way to go, to be sure. It makes only about $5 million to $10 million in annual revenue from subscriptions and selling its AI software, Srinivas told the Wall Street Journal. It will use the new funding to expand from 38 employees now to about 60 by year’s end.\n\nDespite such meager figures, this week’s funding round values the venture at about $520 million.\n\nOf course, Google parent Alphabet has a market cap of more than $1.7 trillion, and Google dominates online search with roughly 90% market share. It has fended off many challengers and has been a leader in AI since well before OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, kicking off the current AI boom. And it’s testing AI-powered search itself on millions of users.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 into its Bing search engine, long a distant second to Google.\n\nStill, while Google faces little immediate danger, it could be hurt in the long run if people start using its search engine less and AI chatbots more as they look for things online.\n\n“If you can directly answer somebody's question, nobody needs those 10 blue links,” Srinivas told the Journal.\n\nHe wrote in the announcement this week, “We stand at the inflection point of a massive behavioral shift in how people access information online…The times of sifting through SEO spam, sponsored links, and multiple web pages will be replaced by a much more efficient way to consume and share information.”\n\nHis venture is still a long shot, but then, so was Amazon when the web was the wave to ride. Now it’s AI, and Bezos is placing a bet that Perplexity will ride it well.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "5 Innovative Stocks That Could Score a Win for Your Portfolio in 2024",
        "content": "What better way to start a year than with a focus on innovation? I'm talking about companies with innovative technologies that are improving (or aim to improve) how things are done. You'll find them in healthcare, technology -- and across a variety of industries. Some of these stocks already have delivered big but have room to run. In other cases, they've stagnated, but have what it takes to roar higher.\n\nAs you begin your investing year, it's a great idea to add a few of these exciting players to your portfolio. If you're a cautious investor, you may try a small position in one or two; if you're an aggressive investor, you might consider bigger positions. Let's check out five innovative stocks that could score a win for your portfolio as early as this year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. CRISPR Therapeutics\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics(NASDAQ: CRSP) just reached a major milestone, winning approval of its very first product: Casgevy, for blood disorders. Casgevy's regulatory nod also marked the first worldwide for a therapy based on CRISPR gene editing.\n\nThe technique, by cutting DNA at a certain location and allowing a repair process to take place, fixes genes responsible for certain diseases. The exciting thing about this is it produces functional cures, greatly improving the lives of patients. So Casgevy, approved for sickle cell disease, can be seen as a game changer -- and CRISPR Therapeutics' pipeline, filled with other gene-editing candidates, may produce more game changers down the road.\n\nThis potential, and the fact that Casgevy revenue should start to roll in this year, should make CRISPR Therapeutics an innovator that could climb in the coming months and beyond.\n\n2. Ginkgo Bioworks\n\nGinkgo Bioworks(NYSE: DNA) can be seen as a key behind-the-scenes player in industries including pharmaceuticals, materials, and agriculture. It engineers organisms that companies in these industries use to develop better products.\n\nThe organism specialist already has ongoing collaborations with many major partners. Most recently it signed a deal for the development of RNA therapeutics with big pharma Pfizer; the collaboration could bring Gingko as much as $331 million. And the company's active projects are on the rise, gaining 36% year over year in the third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nGingko's cell engineering revenue climbed by double-digit percentages in the most recent quarter. And though the company isn't yet profitable, its $1 billion in cash offers it a multiyear runway to help it get there.\n\nAll of this means that Ginkgo's shares, currently trading at less than $2 each, represent an opportunity to get in on a promising player.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock advanced last year, but this top technology player has what it takes to continue delivering gains. As parent of search-engine giant Google, the company attracts a flock of advertisers eager to reach their target audiences -- you and me.\n\nWhen the economy slowed, some investors worried that tight ad budgets would hurt Alphabet. But even as advertising briefly dipped, the company managed to continue growing overall revenue.\n\nWhy should we be confident about continued revenue growth? First, Google holds 91% of the search market and has become part of our search routines; we all know it's hard to change a routine. Second, Alphabet, as part of its investment in artificial intelligence (AI), recently released its most powerful AI model ever. It's testing Gemini in Google search right now, with the goal of making search better and better.\n\nAll of this means that Alphabet looks cheap at only 24 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock has plenty of room to run.\n\n4. Teladoc Health\n\nTeladoc Health(NYSE: TDOC) had it rough over the past couple of years. Investors worried that the telemedicine giant, in spite of revenue gains, was struggling to reach profitability. Billions of dollars in non-cash goodwill impairment charges linked to an acquisition didn't help matters.\n\nBut Teladoc took charge of the situation earlier this year, with the goal of balancing its quest for revenue growth with the quest for profitability. The plan has been bearing fruit, with the company meeting or beating expectations in recent quarters.\n\nNow, Teladoc is taking things one step further by conducting an operational review of its entire business. The goal is to focus investments and attention on its priority of whole-person care. In its recent earnings report, the company suggested that it hopes this move will help share-price performance too.\n\nToday, trading close to its lowest multiple ever in relation to sales, Teladoc makes a top recovery-story buy. TDOC PS Ratio Chart\n\n5. Tesla\n\nTesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock soared last year, but this electric vehicle (EV) leader could continue to gain in 2024 -- and most importantly, over the long run.\n\nThe company has reached an inflection point that may weigh on near-term growth; for example, it's making investments in AI and in efforts to reduce costs over the long haul. But Tesla's goal to be a \"cost leader\" will help maximize earnings growth over the long term, and that's very positive news.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla managed to grow energy generation and storage revenue, as well as services revenue, by double-digit percentages in the most recent quarter. And the company has increased its cash position to more than $26 billion -- a huge plus for a growing innovator, especially in a high-interest-rate environment. Tesla also remains profitable and generates strong levels of free cash flow.\n\nAll of this means that the EV giant could continue to score a win for your portfolio -- possibly as soon as this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Civil liberties advocates are mounting a new challenge to the use by police of Google search data for help solving criminal cases, as the practice draws greater scrutiny nationwide.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAckman Plans to Check MIT’s Kornbluth, Staff for Plagiarism Bitcoin ETF Issuers Clear Major Hurdle on Path to SEC Approval Huawei Teardown Shows 5nm Chip Made in Taiwan, Not China Troubled China Shadow Bank Zhongzhi Files for Bankruptcy Business Insider Says Ackman’s Wife Plagiarized in Her Thesis\n\nAfter a Pennsylvania woman was raped in 2016, police submitted a search warrant to Alphabet’s Google for information about users who had typed the victim’s name or address into the search engine in the week leading up to the attack, according to court papers. Google responded with the IP address of a user who had searched for the victim’s address twice shortly before the incident, court papers show. That breakthrough prompted police to begin monitoring a corrections officer, who was ultimately arrested and convicted.\n\nOn Friday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and its Pennsylvania chapter argued in a court filing that the investigative technique used in the case, known as a keyword search warrant, is dangerously broad and threatens to infringe on the privacy rights of innocent people.\n\n“Keyword search warrants are digital dragnets giving the government permission to rummage through our most private information, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court should find them unconstitutional,” NACDL Fourth Amendment Center Litigation Director Michael Price said in a statement.\n\nA lawyer for the defendant and a representative for Google didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThere are few known examples of keyword search warrants, but the practice has come under scrutiny in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the right to abortion. Privacy advocates have warned that keyword search warrants and geofence warrants, in which police ask Google to produce data about users whose devices were present near the scene of a crime, could be used to prosecute women who obtain abortions in states where it’s illegal.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn October, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that evidence gleaned from a keyword search warrant could be used in a murder case, sparking concerns the decision may encourage more police to embrace the controversial technique.\n\nBut the court stressed that its findings were specific to the facts of the case, and it refrained from weighing in about the use of Google’s search data more broadly. That leaves advocates hopeful for a different outcome in Pennsylvania, said EFF Surveillance Litigation Director Andrew Crocker.\n\nIn December, Google ended its practice of responding to geofence warrants. The move came three months after a Bloomberg Businessweek investigation that found police across the US were increasingly using warrants to obtain location and search data from Google, even for nonviolent cases, and even for people who had nothing to do with the crime.\n\nGoogle’s move on geofence warrants makes it even more important for courts to consider the constitutionality of keyword search warrants, which may grow more popular as police search for new investigative tools, Crocker said.\n\n“Google’s policy change on geofence warrants raises the stakes for keyword warrants,” he said.\n\n--With assistance from Davey Alba.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy America’s Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs Eight Tech Products That Could Define 2024 These Are the Five Potential Trouble Spots That Could Knock the Global Economy Off Course Gen Zers Who Want the Buzz But Not the Hangover Are Fueling a Nonalcoholic Spirits Boom AI Hallucinations Are a Boon to Creatives\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Could Outperform the Nasdaq in 2024",
        "content": "The Magnificent Seven film released in 1960, and its 2016 reboot by the same name depicts seven American gunmen hired to protect a small village from a band of outlaws. However, the movie's name was repurposed in 2023, when Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett used the phrase to describe the seven most influential tech stocks.\n\nThe companies he considers to be the \"Magnificent Seven\" include Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla. These tech names dominate their respective markets and have all delivered more growth over the past 12 months than the Nasdaq Composite. NVDA Chart\n\nMeanwhile, many of these companies will likely continue beating the market in the new year thanks to budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. So, here are two \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that could outperform the Nasdaq in 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nShares in Nvidia skyrocketed in 2023 as it cornered the market on AI chips, achieving an estimated 90% market share. The company beat all other chipmakers to the punch while competitors including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have yet to catch up. As a result, Nvidia has formed lucrative partnerships with AI-minded companies across tech, supplying its hardware to countless names.\n\nWhile many companies are currently in a race to develop the most advanced AI models and produce attractive software tools for the commercial and consumer sectors, Nvidia is cashing in by selling its hardware to most of these organizations. So as AI chip demand has soared, so have Nvidia's earnings.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended October 2023), the company's revenue climbed 206% year over year, while operating income increased by more than 1,600%. The legendary results were mainly attributed to a spike in AI graphic processing unit (GPU) sales, represented by a 279% rise in data center revenue.\n\nIn 2024, competition could heat up in the chip industry, with AMD and Intel both expected to begin shipping new AI products. However, Nvidia's immense dominance will likely be challenging to overcome.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, data from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% until at least 2030 and exceed a value of $1 trillion, suggesting there will be plenty of room for Nvidia to retain its leading position and alternative chip options to enter the industry. NVDA EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThis chart shows that Nvidia's earnings could achieve nearly $20 per share in fiscal 2025. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 40 yields a stock price of $800, projecting 61% growth over the next year.\n\nConsidering the Nasdaq Composite has risen at a CAGR of 25% over the past five years, I'd say there's an excellent chance Nvidia will once again outperform it in 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is another Magnificent Seven stock with considerable growth potential in the new year. The company has ramped up its expansion into AI in 2023, unveiling its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini, in early December.\n\nAccording to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, the new model \"represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts\" the company has undertaken. Gemini is expected to be highly competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and could open countless growth opportunities for Alphabet in AI.\n\nAlphabet already has a powerful position in tech as the home of potent brands, including Google, YouTube, and Android. In fact, the company boasts at least nine products with over 1 billion users, with the top being Google Search, Android, and Chrome.\n\nThe tech giant has used its vast user base to build a lucrative advertising business, responsible for about 25% of the $680 billion digital ad market, according to Statista. However, the popularity of its services could just as easily be used to bolster its position in AI. With the power of Gemini, Alphabet could expand its AI tools on Google Cloud, create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, offer more pointed advertising, and improve the user experience on YouTube. GOOGL EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAlphabet's earnings are projected to hit nearly $7 per share next fiscal year. Running a similar calculation to Nvidia and multiplying that figure by Alphabet's forward P/E of 24 results in a share price of $168. Based on the company's current stock position, that would deliver growth of 21%.\n\nWhile that doesn't outperform the Nasdaq Composite's CAGR of 25% over the past five years, there are plenty of reasons to believe that's a conservative estimate. In 2024, Alphabet will probably begin seeing a return on its investment in AI with the help of Gemini, which could considerably boost its earnings and shares. As a result, I wouldn't bet against seeing this Magnificent Seven stock beat the Nasdaq in 2024. It's a compelling buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value",
        "content": "In 2023, an extraordinary phenomenon unfolded in the stock market: The Magnificent Seven, a group of top-tier stocks, experienced a remarkable surge in their value, ranging from a solid 50% gain to a staggering 240% climb.\n\nThis impressive performance catapulted them into the spotlight as some of the market's most lucrative investments.\n\nAmid this financial whirlwind, a particular focus has been placed on Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Savvy investors, delving into the nuanced world of financial metrics, have pointed out the company's forward price-earnings ratio is notably lower compared to its peers in the Magnificent Seven, raising concern.\n\nAlphabet's valuation portrays the market's anticipation of its future, influenced by pivotal factors such as the seismic shifts brought about by artificial intelligence-driven changes in online consumer behavior, Google's fluctuating share in the digital advertising market and the looming shadow of an antitrust lawsuit. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nDecoding market dynamics: How Google stands in the competitive landscape\n\nThe market attributes a higher price-earnings ratio to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), while Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) falls within a comparable range when juxtaposed with Alphabet.\n\nThe price-earnings ratio is not an arbitrary figure that an investor can assign to determine value, as it has implicit cash flow assumptions. A business that generates a high return on invested capital has more potential to drive growth in cash flow. A high ROIC indicates a company's superior profitability and efficiency in capital allocation. This distinction becomes evident when comparing Apple and Microsoft to Google and Meta.\n\nApple and Microsoft have consistently outperformed Google and Meta in terms of return on invested capital. Their last 10-year average ROICs stood at 25.90% and 16.6%, respectively, while Google and Meta's stood at 13% and 16.20%, respectively. As a result, the figures show the other three peer companies have outperformed Google in terms of profitability and capital efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the contrary, the other three companies in this group, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may not boast impressive ROIC, but their allure lies in higher growth potential, for which investors willingly pay a premium. Specifically, Nvidia and Tesla, being smaller in terms of revenue size, contribute to their distinct valuation dynamics. Meanwhile, Amazon consistently maintains a high price-earnings ratio due to investor optimism surrounding its expanding presence in the retail sector and dominance in the cloud business.\n\nHowever, the search giant's declining market share in digital ad revenue is generating concerns, introducing a nuanced landscape. Lastly, the increasing use cases of AI represent both an opportunity and a threat to its existing business model, while developments in anti-trust lawsuits add a layer of skepticism. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhat are the concerns for Alphabet that are embedded in the price-earnings multiple?\n\nAlphabet recently outperformed expectations for its quarterly performance, beating earnings per share estimates by 6%, rebounding from a slowdown experienced in previous quarters. However, apprehensions persist, particularly concerning Google's search and overall ad revenue business. Lastly, its search revenue accounts for approximately 57% of total revenue and around 73% of total advertising revenue. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhile you may consider it cyclical, the declining market share in digital ad revenue does pose a question of whether Alphabet is losing its long-established dominance in this space.\n\nMeta Platforms and Amazon continue to gain market share in the digital ad revenue market, while Google experiences a decline. Moreover, the way we retrieve information on the internet is changing. AI chatbots are supplanting many of the activities we traditionally performed on search engines. The company realizes the threat to search ad revenue, prompting it to actively address the challenge and make rapid strides in integrating AI across all its services. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: InsiderIntelligence.com\n\nThe recent launch of Gemini, a family of large language models by Google, seems exciting, as it can counter the threat of other LLMs like GPT-4, Claude and Llama. However, it still needs to solve the challenges in the existing business model, where search contributes the most to the business.\n\nAlphabet's cloud division has experienced impressive growth, yet it operates in a highly competitive landscape where Amazon and Microsoft dominate. Investors are dissatisfied with the recent slowdown in the growth of the cloud business, which decreased to 22.5% year over year during the third quarter from 37.6% a year prior.\n\nGoogle's legal battle and the future of search\n\nAlphabet's Google is under legal scrutiny amid allegations of employing questionable tactics to uphold its status as the world's foremost search engine. The U.S. Justice Department claims Google paid massive sums to companies like Apple to make it the default search engine on their devices. Google also admitted that it shares 36% of revenue with Apple for the search results on the iPhone. We could draw several scenarios from this lawsuit.\n\nThe first scenario is that Google wins the case and stays the default search engine on devices like iPhones, and their partnership with Apple remains the same.\n\nThere is another scenario that may go in favor of Google. If the DOJ compels Apple to display a choice screen where users can select their preferred search engine, a majority would likely choose Google, and the search giant would not have to pay anything to Apple.\n\nBut the worst-case scenario would be that Apple develops its own native search engine that would be the default for its Safari browser on all devices, and users would not have any choice.\n\nBeing a default search engine is a huge advantage because most people who put search queries on the browser address bar need to intuitively think about which search engine they post their queries in.\n\nSince Apple will be losing out on revenue from Google in this scenario, there is a possibility that it will try to come up with its own native search engine to recoup the lost revenue. Hence, this scenario could harm Google's search revenue as Safari, Apple's native browser, holds around 20% market share.\n\nWaymo's expansion and Wing's drone delivery partnership with Walmart\n\nGoogle's other bets include several projects. In the recent earnings call, the company mentioned Waymo (an autonomous driving technology company) onboarded more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually added over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist.\n\nAt the same time, Wing, a drone delivery service owned by Google, has unveiled a strategic collaboration with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to offer drone delivery services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nWhile these developments are exciting, they have yet to reach a level of significance that would substantially impact the company's financials or long-term potential.\n\nFurther, in the age of AI, how we retrieve information online is changing. While Google is responding to these changes, its predominant business model, centered around search engine queries, faces potential risks stemming from shifts in how users consume information.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a new digital era, the shift from traditional search engines to AI-driven chatbots marks a pivotal change in consumer behavior. The relentless advancement of LLMs is poised to revolutionize how we seek information, potentially rendering traditional search queries obsolete. This evolution raises critical questions about the future of advertising in an AI-dominated landscape.\n\nWhile the full extent of these changes remains shrouded in the mists of the future, their potential impact on giants like Alphabet cannot be underestimated. For investors, concerns over these AI-induced shifts challenging the company's dominance in search revenue are justified and crucial in navigating the uncertain waters of technological progression.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

For more on this, we turn to Ryan Heath, Axios Global tech correspondent.\n\nThank you for joining us this morning, Ryan. So we know that the EU has really been taking the lead here on framing an AI framework here. What are the expectations for this trip?\n\nRYAN HEATH: Well, it's a doublE-hatted trip actually. So yes, the EU has locked down its new AI Act. But the big thing there is it's actually not going to be enforced for another year for the first half. And the second half, it's going to be two years before they start implementing it. But the way regulators work, obviously, is playing catch up to markets a lot of the time. So the previous big piece of legislation, which is about trying to limit the power of big tech gatekeepers. That's really coming into force from March this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo Vestager is going to be here previewing the AI Act, but also a little bit reading the Riot Act about this digital markets legislation, which is really trying to make sure that the big companies run open ecosystems. They don't try and lock you into their app stores. They don't preference their own systems. So she's going to go around these companies one by one. And work through how they're going to relate on this legislation together.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And Ryan, how do you think this is going to be received? Because they're really being perceived as gatekeepers here, but they also want to be at the really at the forefront of some of the legislation, as well. How do you balance that?\n\nRYAN HEATH: Yeah. It's really tricky. So the companies have a very different attitude to 10 or 20 years ago. And some of them are very new too. So they've only ever known this very aggressive European Union. But I think the Googles of the world, the Metas, the Apples, they've come to realize the EU isn't going away. They don't particularly like the way the EU approaches regulation. But they know that it's a very lucrative market. And it makes more sense to play ball with them at some level.\n\nSo there's this constant tension between how do they give a little bit to the EU, look cooperative, but at the same time, don't do anything to cannibalize their business. And that's the constant back and forth between the companies and people like Vestager. And she's back in the hot seat now because she was running for a new position to be head of the European Investment Bank. And she lost out. So now, she's coming back with her tail a little bit between her legs. And she's got one year left to secure her legacy and make a difference.\n\nSo you might see a slightly fine tuned Vestager in these meetings as well.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So are we expecting her to really try and make her mark here, or really try and do what it takes to really get some results here? As you said, because the legislation isn't supposed to kick in for another year.\n\nRYAN HEATH: Yeah. I think she's really got to try and secure some results. She's a pragmatist at the end of the day. She said fairly radical and ambitious goals. And then she puts her head down and tries to find pragmatic ways to get some of the way there. And now, she's really into that tail end of her time in Brussels. And she's had a few defeats in big court cases over the past 12 and 18 months. So it's really time to show some results. It's not enough to just wave a piece of legislation around. She's got to actually make a difference in how these companies operate and how the market itself is structured.\n\nAnd so I think there's going to be a lot of that pragmatism on show during this visit.",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google has added a \"Calls\" tab to its Google Meet web app, integrating the meeting side with the traditional Duo direct dialing feature.\r\n\r\nThe recent update comes with a navigation drawer that allows users to switch between \"Meetings\" and \"Calls.\"\r\n\r\nWith this new feature, Google Meet now offers meeting and direct calling functionality on mobile, while the \"Meet (original)\" app remains with a video tab for meetings.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to gain solid traction across various enterprises on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nMore on Google Meet\n\nApart from the addition of the Calls tab, Alphabet introduced an On-the-Go mode for Google Meet users on mobile, enhancing the meeting experience by detecting motion and prompting users to enable the mode.\r\n\r\nAnother Google Meet update now allows Workspace users to make direct calls, allowing them to share meetings via calendar invite, chat, or email. This change allows users to place cloud-encrypted 1:1 video calls directly to colleagues, similar to personal users.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a recent Google Meet update now enables gesture detection to trigger a \"Raise hand\" button in the toolbar, allowing users to raise their hand for Q&A sessions and moderation.\r\n\r\nThe company also rolled out portrait touch-ups on Google Meet, offering two subtle and smoothing options for users to enhance their appearance before or during meetings. These visual tweaks are designed to help users feel their best, especially after workouts, colds, or jetlag.\n\nStrengthening Workspace Offerings\n\nAlphabet’s growing efforts to bolster its Google Meet capabilities will, in turn, boost its Workspace offerings.\r\n\r\nNotably, Alphabet unveiled Google Chat redesigns featuring Home, Direct messages, Spaces and Mentions in a pill-shaped container, replacing the bottom bar and \"New\" floating action button (FAB).\r\n\r\nFurther, this home-screen redesign is gradually advancing to Android following the widespread release of the \"New\" FAB icon.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Alphabet’s introduction of a paid \"Proofread\" feature on Google Docs, powered by AI to replace current spelling and grammar checks, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAll these above-mentioned endeavors to strengthen Google Workspace offerings will, in turn, likely boost its Google Cloud segment, which has become an integral part of Alphabet’s overall growth. The company’s shares have gained 56.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 47.6%.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the strengthening Google Cloud segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Camtek CAMT, KT KT and Everbridge EVBG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAlphabet’s growing chatbot capabilities will further solidify its presence in the global chatbot market. This, in turn, will strengthen the company’s generative AI efforts, which are acting as key catalysts for the company. Alphabet’s shares have gained 56.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 47.6%.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these efforts are expected to strengthen its presence in the booming generative AI market space.\r\n \r\nPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the chatbot market size is expected to hit $7.01 billion in 2024 and grow to $20.8 billion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 24.3% between 2024 and 2029.\r\n\r\nA Markets and Markets report indicates that the generative AI market will reach $76.8 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 31.5% during the forecast period of 2023-2030.\r\n\r\nSolidifying prospects in these promising markets presents a significant growth opportunity for Alphabet. This, in turn, is expected to benefit its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%.

This version outperforms GPT-4 on tasks, shortens prompts and speeds up API calls.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Amazon’s cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services, introduced Amazon Q, an AI-powered chatbot that assists in content creation and action-taking based on customer information repositories, code and enterprise systems.\r\n\r\nFurther, Amazon Q streamlines tasks, accelerates decision-making and fosters creativity by providing personalized information and advice tailored to individual user identities, roles and permissions.\r\n\r\nBaidu, on the other hand, launched its chatbot, Ernie Bot, allowing users to ask questions, prompt it for market analysis and summarize documents.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Baidu's Ernie Bot chatbot has attracted over 100 million users in China, indicating strong growth potential and potentially boosting its Cloud business.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Atlassian (TEAM) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.66 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 1, 2024.\n\nTEAM has an Earnings ESP figure of 7.67%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.66 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.61.\n\nTEAM is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Alphabet (GOOGL) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSlated to report earnings on February 1, 2024, Alphabet holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.87 a share 27 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alphabet is $1.62, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 15.16%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTEAM and GOOGL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into as We Head Into 2024",
        "content": "As we look back on 2023, a few things stand out. One is how quickly generative artificial intelligence (AI) rose to prominence. OpenAI's ChatGPT was virtually unheard of as the year began but quickly became the rallying cry for a generation of tech investors.\n\nAnother was the emergence of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks, which outperformed the broader market by a wide margin (presented in order of stock price percentage gains):\n\nNvidia: Up 239% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): Up 194% Tesla: Up 102% Amazon: Up 81% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): Up 58% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): Up 57% Apple: Up 48%\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the potential to benefit from advancements in generative AI is the gossamer thread that weaves this group of stocks together. What is surprising is that Wall Street -- which rarely agrees on anything -- is moving in lockstep to snatch up stocks best positioned to profit from AI.\n\nBelow, I'll look at three stocks that hedge fund billionaires were piling into as 2023 drew to a close. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1: Microsoft\n\nKen Griffin is something of a legend on Wall Street, famously shorting stocks before the market crash of 1987, better known as \"Black Monday.\" Recent reports suggest the founder and CEO of Citadel plans to return $7 billion in profits to hedge fund investors after generating returns of roughly 15% last year -- outperforming many of his peers -- though the final tally hasn't been released.\n\nThis isn't the first time Griffin was at the top of the class. Citadel generated profits of $16 billion in 2022, dubbed \"the biggest annual windfall on record\" by CNN.\n\nOne of the biggest contributors to Griffin's success last year was an investment in Microsoft. Citadel is extremely diversified, with only four positions rising to more than 1% of the fund. Despite those constraints, Microsoft and video game titan Activision Blizzard made up its two largest holdings to close out the third quarter (the most recent period for which regulatory filings are available).\n\nStory continues\n\nCitadel had amassed a stake of 5 million shares of Microsoft stock, representing 1.7% of the fund, worth roughly $1.87 billion. It also held more than 15 million shares of Activision Blizzard stock, representing 1.5% of the fund's holdings, worth roughly $1.43 billion.\n\nMicrosoft recently completed its acquisition of Activision, so the position was likely used to leverage the merger arbitrage -- a way to profit from the difference between Activision's then-current stock price and the eventual purchase price.\n\nHowever, there's little doubt Griffin owns Microsoft because of the vast potential of AI. He's been vocal about the potential represented by generative AI, admitting that Citadel uses Microsoft Copilot, which he said increases the productivity of the funds' developers by 10%. With 1,500 developers on staff, that's the equivalent of increasing its workforce by 150 people. He also says that the adoption of AI is still in the \"early innings.\"\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), AI systems like Copilot buoyed Microsoft's Azure cloud results, as revenue grew 29% year over year. This not only outpaced its cloud rivals, but Microsoft noted that 3 percentage points of the gains were the result of increasing demand for AI services.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2: Alphabet\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman is the founder and CEO of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and is well known on Wall Street. He made his name as an aggressive activist investor, buying shares in undervalued companies and agitating for change. Among his most notable wins was turning a $60 million position in distressed shopping mall operator General Growth Properties -- a company on the fast track to bankruptcy -- into a profit of nearly $3.5 billion.\n\nUnlike many funds, Pershing Square is highly concentrated, with its $10 billion portfolio invested in just seven companies. The largest stake -- by a fair margin -- is Alphabet. The fund owns 9.38 million Class C shares and 4.35 million Class A shares, making the total value of the stake $1.92 billion. This represents more than 19% of the Pershing Square portfolio.\n\nIn an interview last month, Ackman laid out the logic for his biggest stake. \"It was AI that created the opportunity for us to buy Google at an attractive price,\" Ackman said.\n\nHe suggested investor fears that Alphabet had fallen behind Microsoft in AI crushed the stock. He went on to note that Alphabet's industry-leading digital advertising business alone is worth the stock price, and investors get all the AI potential \"for free.\" He also believes that Alphabet's AI technology is competitive with -- if not ahead of -- Microsoft's.\n\nAckman has a point. Alphabet has a long and storied history of developing AI, and the rebound of online advertising from its historic slump is already improving the company's financial results. The vast potential to benefit from AI is icing on the cake.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 3: Meta Platforms\n\nBillionaire Chase Coleman is one of Wall Street's boy geniuses and a member of the fabled Tiger Cubs -- a group of hedge fund managers that learned their craft from Julian Robertson, Jr., legendary founder of Tiger Management. Coleman parlayed $25 million in seed money into more than $13 billion in assets under management for Tiger Global Management, the hedge fund he founded.\n\nMeta Platforms is by far the fund's largest holding, totaling 8.9 million shares, or roughly 20% of the portfolio (not a typo). Its stake is valued at more than $3 billion.\n\nColeman has made no secret that he's intrigued by the potential of AI, saying, \"Tech is interesting again,\" thanks to the advent of AI, which he refers to as \"pretty interesting new technology.\" His advice for those investing in AI? \"Think about it in terms of companies investing in these technologies and how well they use it.\"\n\nWhen it comes to using AI, Meta Platforms has a long and distinguished track record, deploying these advanced algorithms to tag people in photos, surface relevant content, and target advertising on its bevy of social media sites. The company also leveraged its AI expertise to develop generative AI models that are available on all the major cloud infrastructure services -- for a fee, of course.\n\nFurthermore, the ongoing rebound in online advertising has already fueled an uptick in Meta's results, a trend that will likely continue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) investing became popular in 2023, 2024 should be another strong year for these investments. Last year was one of discovery and hype, while 2024 will be a year of implementation. This will separate the wheat from the chaff, and companies with strong and relevant AI solutions will rise to the top.\n\nThis makes me want to own stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), as they each have strong AI offerings in their respective industries.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet is one of the more popular AI stock picks for a good reason: It has been dedicated to AI for many years. Alphabet's latest version of its generative AI model, Gemini, smokes the competition (like OpenAI's GPT-4) in many benchmarks, making it a solid choice to build models on. Alphabet hasn't recognized revenue from this technology yet, but it will be coming in 2024.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet's cloud computing service, Google Cloud, remains a popular pick for AI workloads. With more than half of generative AI start-ups using Google Cloud, it has a solid hold on tomorrow's rising businesses. This could help Alphabet make up some ground in the cloud computing race, as it is behind Microsoft and Amazon in market share.\n\nAlphabet is a solid AI pick, but its stock is also a bargain right now. Investors can pick up shares for just 18 times 2024 earnings -- far cheaper than many of its big tech peers. 2024 will be an exciting year for Alphabet, and I'm excited to see what the stock can do.\n\nAdobe\n\nAdobe is a well-established industry leader in digital media. It also has other tools for marketing and commerce as well. However, it's not asleep at the wheel -- it's launching several AI products to keep it from being dethroned.\n\nIn the digital media space, it has Adobe Firefly, which combines generative AI with media creation. With a text input, Firefly can create or modify images. This can accelerate the creation of designs and make them modular, allowing them to easily adapt an image to a customer or season.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the commerce side, Adobe Sensei helps process data to make better decisions. It also can assist in pinpointing how customers want to be advertised to, a huge step in creating a truly customized experience.\n\nAdobe is seamlessly integrating AI into its products, making it a strong AI pick in 2024.\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike operates in the cybersecurity space, and uses a branch of AI known as machine learning to provide best-in-class protection. By analyzing trillions of data points weekly, it knows what is normal activity and what isn't. This allows it to pinpoint a threat and shut down access to a company's servers within minutes of a breach.\n\nIts endpoint protection brings customers to CrowdStrike, but it also has more than 20 other offerings to bolster a client's protection. With 63% of customers using at least five or more products, CrowdStrike has done an excellent job upselling its customers.\n\nAlthough its platform has rapidly grown (CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue rose 35% to $3.15 billion in Q3 FY 2024, ending October 31), there's still a massive runway for it. Through all of its combined offerings, CrowdStrike estimates its current market opportunity is $100 billion. However, it expects the market to expand to $225 billion by 2028 through new product launches and market expansion. CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCrowdStrike and its AI-utilizing cybersecurity platform are just getting started, making it an excellent AI investment choice for 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Hedge Fund Manager Bill Ackman Thinks You Can Buy This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock \"For Free.\" Here's Why I Think He's Right",
        "content": "One of the most closely followed investors on Wall Street is Bill Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management. Last year, it was revealed the hedge fund manager opened a position in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of internet search tool Google and video sharing platform YouTube.\n\nAckman's investment strategy is quite simple. While other institutional investors tend to own several stocks in each sector, Ackman instead identifies a small cohort of businesses that he believes are overlooked and potentially undervalued -- making it easy to understand which stocks he appreciates over the competition. For this reason, Ackman's stake in Alphabet represented something greater than just a new position. Rather, it signaled his conviction in the company's position among artificial intelligence (AI) leaders. But why?\n\nDuring a recent interview with David Rubinstein, a co-founder of private equity giant Carlyle, Ackman revealed that he thinks investors can buy Alphabet's AI business \"for free.\" While this is quite the conjecture, I think he's right.\n\nLet's dig into why Alphabet might just be the most overlooked AI stock among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nAlphabet's advertising business faces headwinds...\n\nAt its core, Alphabet is an advertising business. Given that Google and YouTube are the world's top two most-visited websites, it's easy to comprehend why advertisers flock to these platforms. Moreover, with Alphabet's surface area online, the company can command strong pricing power from customers.\n\nThis business model has historically resulted in strong revenue growth and, more importantly, robust margin expansion for Alphabet. However, the last couple of years haven't gone so well for the company.\n\nFor starters, the macroeconomy was plagued with high inflation, thereby causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates nearly a dozen times. As a result, businesses of all sizes reined in spending and operated under tighter budgets. Very few businesses were immune to these dynamics, and the already cyclical advertising sector was no exception.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to broader market dynamics, Alphabet's advertising operation also faces increasing competition. The popularity of social media app TikTok, combined with other major players such as Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram), put Alphabet in a tough spot. In fact, Alphabet's advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 actually declined on a year-over-year basis, spooking investors about the company's prospects.\n\nHowever, perhaps its biggest challenge comes from Microsoft. The Windows developer arguably kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race early last year following a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the start-up behind ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft's perceived first-mover advantage in AI, coupled with intensifying competition and a tough economy, had many investors questioning how dominant Alphabet's future within Internet search and advertising may be. Unsurprisingly, the stock cratered nearly 40% in 2022. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n...and its AI pursuit appears overlooked\n\nAlthough it can be easy to be persuaded by mainstream sentiment, long-term investors can often think beyond whatever crisis is currently taking place. Alphabet no doubt faced headwinds in its core advertising segment. But keep in mind, it's this business that fueled billions in free cash flow for Alphabet over the years and provided the company the financial fuel to invest in other areas.\n\nWhile investors started to sour on Alphabet in 2022, the company remained focused and found ways to diversify its business -- namely through strategic acquisitions. The company's investment in cybersecurity infrastructure has played an integral role in the development of its cloud computing operation, which is taking on industry stalwarts Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nIn fact, the growth of Alphabet's cloud business has been a pillar in the company's AI pursuit. This is a big deal, and subtly underscores why Ackman sees Alphabet's AI business as free.\n\nIs Alphabet's AI business really free?\n\nAlphabet stock rebounded nearly 60% in 2023. Keep in mind, however, that the company only increased its total revenue by 7% year over year through Sept. 30. Perhaps what sparked renewed investor enthusiasm was Alphabet's return to growth in advertising. While encouraging, it's this dynamic that has me thinking investors are missing the bigger picture.\n\nAlphabet's cloud segment increased sales by 26% year over year through Sept. 30, and it is now consistently generating positive operating income. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are increasingly becoming integrated throughout Alphabet's cloud offerings, helping spark rising demand over the competition.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet swiftly answered Microsoft's call and hasn't been shy about showing off its own AI capabilities. The latest installment from the company is its ChatGPT competitor, called Gemini. As Alphabet continues to integrate AI across its suite of productivity tools, cloud infrastructure, Google Search, and YouTube, more accelerated revenue and profit growth could follow.\n\nYet, as of this writing, Alphabet stock trades at only a 20.7 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple -- nearly identical to that of the S&P 500. By contrast, Apple, which is experiencing declining revenue, trades at a forward P/E of 28, while Microsoft trades at 33 times forward earnings.\n\nI think Ackman is right in that many investors appear to be completely overlooking Alphabet's AI progress -- not even realizing that it's AI that helped reignite the company's growth. To me, Alphabet's bargain valuation offers investors an opportunity to own a leading AI developer at a steep discount relative to the competition.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "If I Could Buy Just 1 FAANG Stock in 2024, This Would Be It",
        "content": "Since the acronym was first coined more than a decade ago, FAANG has become synonymous with big tech, representing some of the best-performing stocks of a generation:\n\nFacebook, which changed its name to Meta Platforms Apple Amazon Netflix Google, now known as Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) META Chart\n\nIt's easy to understand the attraction. These five companies are all leaders in their respective industries, changing the technological landscape as we know it. Try to imagine a world without their collective impact on social media, mobile communication, e-commerce, cloud computing, streaming video, and online search -- it's hard to picture.\n\nThe paradigm shift wrought by each of these companies has also been profitable for their investors. Since the acronym debuted in early 2013, these stocks generated life-changing returns of between 626% and 1,790%, far outpacing the broader market.\n\nInvestors shouldn't be too quick to discount them even today, as they remain dominant forces, and each one outperformed both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite in 2023.\n\nI am a longtime shareholder in all the FAANG stocks, but if I could buy just one in 2024, Alphabet would be the clear choice. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe once and future king\n\nIt's difficult enough for a company to dominate one industry, so the fact that Alphabet dominates two and is a strong contender in a third is all the more impressive.\n\nIt all began with internet search. Since the debut of Google Search in 1997, the company has dominated the landscape, currently controlling 92% of the market, according to internet statistics aggregator StatCounter. Google search acts as a conduit for Alphabet's industry-leading online advertising business. It was responsible for 30% of digital ad sales worldwide in 2022, according to data compiled by online industry publication Digiday. It's unlikely that would have changed much in 2023, though the final tally isn't yet available.\n\nThere's no question the digital advertising industry has faced headwinds over the past couple of years, as marketing budgets have historically been slashed in the face of economic uncertainty -- and the recent bear market was no different.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt appears the tide has turned, and online advertising is on the rebound. After declining for several consecutive quarters, Google's ad sales have posted year-over-year increases in each of the previous two quarters, and that trend is expected to continue. As the industry leader, Alphabet has the most to benefit from the recovery.\n\nLast but certainly not least is Alphabet's competitive position in cloud infrastructure services as No. 3 of the \"Big 3\" cloud providers. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are No. 1 and No. 2, respectively.\n\nFor most of the past several years, Google Cloud has been the fastest-growing of the three, though it recently ceded that title (at least temporarily) to Microsoft. Azure was quick to offer artificial intelligence (AI) services to its cloud customers, which helped the company gain market share. Google has since launched its own set of cloud-related AI tools, which could help change the dynamic.\n\nThe adoption of AI has just begun\n\nThe advent of generative AI last year caused a stir because of its ability to create original content and streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks. As a result, businesses are scrambling to take advantage of the resulting increases in productivity. No one knows how lucrative AI will ultimately be, but most experts place the market opportunity in the trillions of dollars -- though estimates vary wildly.\n\nAlphabet recognized the opportunity and rolled out a number of AI-powered offerings, which include more than 100 built AI models, via its Vertex AI platform. This accelerates the time it takes to adopt AI and helps Google Cloud users \"build, deploy, and scale AI-powered applications,\" the company says.\n\nIt recently introduced Duet AI, which it says was \"specifically trained to help users be more productive on Google Cloud.\" Duet was also integrated into Alphabet's cybersecurity, search, and a variety of other products and services.\n\nThe most recent development was last month's introduction of Google Gemini, the next-generation large language model that underpins its AI. Early assessments suggest that Gemini offers five times greater computational capacity than OpenAI's GPT-4, according to tests conducted by semiconductor research company SemiAnalysis. This could mark a big step forward for Alphabet's AI ambitions.\n\nGoogle has a keen advantage as one of the major cloud providers, offering it a built-in delivery mechanism for getting AI into the hands of customers. Needham analyst Laura Martin suggested that generative AI will help catapult Alphabet's market cap to $3 trillion in the coming years, or a potential upside of about 73% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nAlphabet stock is historically cheap\n\nAs outlined above, there's a lot to like about Alphabet. The company leads the way in search and digital advertising and is a keen competitor in cloud infrastructure services. There are other opportunities, which include YouTube (its ubiquitous streaming service) and its autonomous driving platform Waymo.\n\nThose opportunities aside, perhaps the most compelling reason to buy Alphabet is its sticker price. The stock is historically cheap, selling for roughly 26 times earnings, comparable with the S&P 500, even though Alphabet has far outpaced the wider market recently and over the past decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Over multidecade periods, Wall Street has proved to be a bona fide wealth-creating machine. But over shorter timelines, such as a few months or a couple of years, directional moves in the major stock indexes can be unpredictable.\n\nFor the past decade, when the going has gotten tough on Wall Street, investors have turned to the time-tested FAANG stocks.\n\nBy \"FAANG,\" I'm talking about:\n\nFacebook, which is now a subsidiary of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from absolutely crushing the broader market in the return department over the trailing decade, these five companies dominate their respective industries.\n\nMeta Platforms owns some of the top social media \"real estate\" on the planet and attracted nearly 4 billion active users to its sites each month during the September-ended quarter. Apple's iPhone accounts for better than 50% of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, its share repurchase program over the past decade is unmatched by any public company. Nearly 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022 can be traced to Amazon's online marketplace. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is also the world's top cloud infrastructure service provider by spending. Netflix is both the domestic and international market share leader in streaming services. Further, no streaming company comes close to matching its library of original content. Alphabet's Google is pretty much a monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in December.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the FAANGs could differ dramatically in the new year. While two of these outperformers remain historically inexpensive and are ripe for the picking, another industry leader has seen its growth engine stall.\n\nFAANG stock No. 1 to buy hand over fist in 2024: Meta Platforms\n\nDespite shares nearly tripling in 2023, social media stock Meta Platforms stands out as a clear-cut value play in the new year (and beyond).\n\nStory continues\n\nArguably, the biggest risk for Meta is the possibility of the U.S. falling into a recession in 2024. A couple of money-focused metrics and forecasting tools with exemplary track records do suggest a challenging year lies ahead. Since Meta generates more than 98% of its revenue from advertising and businesses are typically quick to pare back their ad spending in a weakening economy, this would be bad news for the company.\n\nThe thing about recessions that's often overlooked is just how short-lived they typically are. Nine of the 12 recessions following World War II haven't lasted a year, while none of the remaining three made it past 18 months. By comparison, there have been two economic expansions that endured at least a full decade since 1945. More often than not, ad-driven companies are enjoying a favorable economic climate.\n\nWhat really puts the ball in Meta's court is its aforementioned social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site globally, while Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are, collectively, among the most-downloaded apps worldwide. In spite of seemingly endless competition, Meta's social media apps continue to shine and draw in a greater number of monthly active users. That's great news for its ad-pricing power.\n\nInvestors should also consider that Meta's mammoth operating cash flow and cash-rich balance sheet give it the luxury of investing in high-growth initiatives. Though its augmented/virtual reality segment, Reality Labs, has lost nearly $11.5 billion through the first nine months of 2023, its family of apps has generated $41.8 billion in profit. Meta is also sitting on more than $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. CEO Mark Zuckerberg can make investments for the future without hurting his company's bread-and-butter operating segment.\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms remains historically cheap after its big run-up. Shares can be purchased for 11.8 times forward-year cash flow, which is 25% below Meta's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing five years.\n\nFAANG stock No. 2 to buy hand over fist in 2024: Alphabet\n\nThe other FAANG stock investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024 is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nNot to sound like a broken record, but Alphabet shares the same biggest concern as Meta Platforms: a potential slowdown in advertising. Alphabet brought in about 78% of its revenue during the third quarter from advertising. If the U.S. economy slows down in the new year, it's probable that businesses would taper their ad spending -- at least in the short run.\n\nWhat Alphabet has working in its favor is its practical monopoly status in global internet search. According to monthly search share data provided by GlobalStats, the last time Google closed out a month with less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search was March 2015. It's the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to reach consumers, which should propel strong ad-pricing power for parent company Alphabet.\n\nHowever, it's the company's ancillary operating segments that represent its most-intriguing growth prospects in 2024 (and beyond). In particular, cloud infrastructure service provider Google Cloud has turned the corner to recurring profitability. Enterprise cloud spending has a long growth runway, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, as of the September-ended quarter.\n\nYouTube is no slouch, either. It's attracting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, which trails only Facebook, and has seen daily views of Shorts (short-form videos that typically last less than a minute) shoot past 50 billion. Both premium subscriptions and advertising demand should increase in the new year.\n\nBest of all, Alphabet remains inexpensive. Shares can be purchased for 14.4 times forward-year cash flow to begin 2024. That's a notable discount to its average cash flow multiple of 18 over the previous five years. Image source: Apple.\n\nThe FAANG stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Apple\n\nUnfortunately, not every FAANG stock is poised to be a winner in 2024. Although tech stock Apple has been one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the past 20 years, it's not a company I'd suggest putting money to work in this year.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- Apple is a pretty phenomenal business. As noted, it accounts for half or more of U.S. smartphone market share. Further, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the evolution of Apple into a platforms-focused company. An operating model that emphasizes subscription services should lift Apple's operating margin over time, as well as alleviate some of the wild revenue swings that usually accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nBut it's not about where Apple has been so much as where it's going. Right now, Apple isn't going anywhere. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple reported an $11 billion (2.8%) year-over-year decline in sales. Though its services segment generated 9% sales growth for the fiscal year, every physical product division saw sales decline -- iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Wearables.\n\nWhat makes this underperformance even more eye-popping is that it occurred with above-average inflation as a tailwind. Apple is one of the best-known and most-trusted brands on the planet. The fact that it wasn't able to raise its prices enough to lift its sales with above-average inflation demonstrates how weak organic demand was for its physical products in fiscal 2023.\n\nTo add to this, while Apple was able to avoid a decline in year-over-year earnings per share thanks to its incredible share repurchase program, net income did decline from $99.8 billion to $97 billion. In other words, buybacks appear to be the only thing really saving Apple stock from a meltdown at this point.\n\nHistorically, investors have had no qualms paying an aggressive multiple to own shares of Apple if the company is growing by a double-digit rate. But with a negative real-growth rate, Apple stock is highly unattractive at 27 times forward-year earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

Alphabet’s Google, which owns YouTube, has consistently denied being their boss, even after NLRB officials last year deemed it a “joint employer” of the workers – a company with enough control over them to be liable for their treatment and obligated to negotiate with them if they unionize.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company plans to appeal the ruling in federal court.\n\n“As we’ve said before, we have no objection to these Cognizant employees electing to form a union,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We simply believe it’s only appropriate for Cognizant, as their employer, to engage in collective bargaining.”\n\nThe treatment of contract workers has been a constant point of contention for Alphabet, which relies heavily on staffing firms. Contract staff became the majority of the company’s global workforce in 2018, and the Alphabet Workers Union, an affiliate of the Communications Workers of America, has been pushing to organize both those workers and Alphabet’s direct employees since it launched in 2021.\n\n“Any future appeals by Alphabet are just an attempt to avoid collectively bargaining with the union and pad the pockets of shareholders and executives,” YouTube Music worker Katie-Marie Marschner said in an emailed statement from the union.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn their ruling Wednesday, a trio of Democratic NLRB members ordered Google to “cease and desist” from refusing to recognize and negotiate with the union, and “in any like or related manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed” under federal labor law.\n\nThe Alphabet union filed a complaint with the NLRB early last year accusing Alphabet and Cognizant of responding to the union campaign by making threats, transferring work abroad and using new return-to-office rules to try to derail organizing. Cognizant has said the allegations have “no merit.” That complaint is still pending.\n\nAnother group of Alphabet contract staff, who are employed via Accenture Plc to work on content for Google’s support pages, voted to unionize with the Alphabet Workers Union in November; Alphabet is appealing an NLRB regional director’s determination that it is a joint employer of those workers as well.\n\n(Updates with union comment in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy America’s Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs These Are the Five Potential Trouble Spots That Could Knock the Global Economy Off Course Help, I Saw My Boss on a Dating Site AI Hallucinations Are a Boon to Creatives Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Recasts, adds CEO quotes, background)\n\nBy Krystal Hu and Pritam Biswas\n\nJan 4 (Reuters) - Search startup Perplexity AI has raised $73.6 million from a group of investors including Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the latest example of investors hunting for AI startups that challenge incumbents.\n\nThe round was led by venture capital firm IVP and valued the company at about $520 million, according to the company. NEA, NVIDIA, Databricks, and Bessemer Venture Partners also participated in the round.\n\nPerplexity's search tools enable users to get instant answers to questions with sources and citations. It is powered by a variety of large language models (LLMs) that can sum up and generate information, from OpenAI to Meta's open-source model Llama.\n\nSan Francisco, California-based Perplexity AI, which raised $25.6 million in March last year in a round led by NEA, said it has served more than 500 million queries in 2023 while spending few marketing dollars.\n\nThe company plans to use the funding to hire and build the products. It now has 38 people and plans to reach about 60 by the end of this year.\n\nIts website and mobile web had 45 million visits in December, up from 2.2 million when the service became available in December 2022, according to Similarweb data.\n\nDespite its fast growth, the company, which is not profitable and generates single-digit million revenue annually, is a moonshot in the online search market where Google has about 90% market share.\n\nMicrosoft, the backer of OpenAI, has been integrating AI into search engine Bing in the past year but so far failed to take major market share away from Google.\n\nAravind Srinivas, chief executive at Perplexity, said the startup's advantage lies in its focus and ability to fine-tune a variety of top-performing AI models instead of locking into one.\n\n\"Google is going to be viewed as something that's legacy and old, and Perplexity will be viewed as something that's the next generation and future,\" said Srinivas.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google recently added Pixel Launcher shortcuts on Android.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Google introduced a Pixel Launcher search shortcut for Password Manager, displaying \"password\" or \"password manager\" search options on selected Pixel devices.\r\n\r\nFurther, the company’s recent move allows Pixel Launcher to display an expanded temperature card when searching for \"weather,\" with the \"See full forecast\" shortcut opening a larger search results page.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is expected to get solid traction across Pixel users on the back of its latest move.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the new enhancement will bolster Google’s Android offerings, which have been a key growth driver for the company.

Quote\n\nMore on Pixel Launcher\n\nApart from the latest move, Google, via Pixel Launcher, is now launching \"voice search\" instead of Assistant, a feature that dates back to the pre-Assistant Google Now era. This change is part of Google App 15.0, which is currently in beta.\r\n\r\nGoogle also updated the Pixel Launcher search, which now displays interactive Quick Settings Tiles in search results, including Internet, Bluetooth, Hotspot, Do Not Disturb, Camera/Microphone access, Screen Cast, Screen record, Home/Device controls, Location and Battery Saver.\r\n\r\nAnother Pixel Launcher update allows users to search and \"quick launch\" apps without tapping the top of the screen, replacing the previous functionality of typing an application's name and pressing enter on a virtual keyboard.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Google’s update of the Pixel Launcher search experience, introducing a new Messages shortcut that displays recent conversations in a carousel-like format, remains noteworthy.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors are expected to bolster the Google Services segment that accounts for the majority of GOOGL’s total revenues.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +6.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 4.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.62 per share, indicating a change of +54.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 points to a change of +27.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 indicates a change of +15.6% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Alphabet.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $254.71 billion and $283.39 billion estimates indicate +8.9% and +11.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $64.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.9%. EPS of $1.55 for the same period compares with $1.06 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $63.13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.45%. The EPS surprise was +6.9%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Alphabet surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc., the biggest maker of mobile phone processors, announced the Snapdragon XR2+ chip designed for virtual and mixed reality headsets that will compete with Apple Inc.’s forthcoming Vision Pro.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIslamic State Claims Responsibility for Deadly Iran Blasts Just a Billion Doesn’t Cut It on This Exclusive Florida Island Confidential Jeffrey Epstein Documents Unsealed by New York Court Tech’s Losing Streak Extends Ahead of Jobs Test: Markets Wrap Deadly Iran Blasts and Red Sea Warnings Fan Mideast Tensions\n\nThe San Diego-based chipmaker said the new component, which can run 12 or more high-definition cameras, will be used by Samsung Electronics Co. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google on products under development.\n\nThe market for devices that project information onto the user’s view of the physical world was fired up last year by Apple’s announcement that it would sell a mixed-reality headset. Qualcomm’s chips have been at the heart of many of other companies’ attempts to lure consumers to the category, which hasn’t yet taken off.\n\nAugmented reality imposes graphics and written content on top of a person’s view of the world. Virtual reality places a consumer in a closed digital world. Apple’s coming Vision Pro and Meta Platforms Inc.’s most-recent Quest 3 headset mix the technologies. Previous versions Qualcomm’s XR chip have featured in devices from Microsoft Inc. and Meta.\n\nHeadsets with the XR2+ will use processors and graphics components that are as much as 20% better than their predecessors to project 4K-resolution images on each lens, according to Qualcomm’s Said Bakadir, a senior director of product management.\n\nThat improvement in quality will ease eye fatigue from reading text, reduce the potential for motion sickness and let device makers implement new features, he said. The chip’s ability to handle more cameras will aid in depth perception and the eye tracking required to orient the user in the real world and recognize items.\n\nStory continues\n\n“A lot of people want more juice to do more things,” Bakadir said. “People want to push the platform even higher.”\n\nQualcomm is working with a number of partners in addition to Google and Samsung, and announcements from customers may come as soon as next week’s CES show with products available as early as this year, he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy America’s Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs These Are the Five Potential Trouble Spots That Could Knock the Global Economy Off Course Help, I Saw My Boss on a Dating Site Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?

        "title": "4 Stocks I'm Going \"All In\" on in 2024",
        "content": "Sometimes, the market gives investors once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunities. While there aren't as many of those available right now due to the market nearing all-time highs, there are a few stocks I see myself going \"all in\" on in 2024.\n\nSo, what are these stocks? Read on to find out.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock I'm excited about in 2024. While the third quarter was a high note for many of Amazon's business segments, its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business reported a ho-hum quarter. However, management noted that some of the headwinds are beginning to die down while new workloads are coming online.\n\nCouple that tailwind with Amazon's margin profile, and you've got a recipe for a stock that could have a phenomenal 2024. In Q3, nearly all of Amazon's profit measures approached all-time highs. Furthermore, they did it without secular tailwinds (like COVID-19 lockdowns). AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith Amazon set to have a full year of high profits and a rebounding business segment, I'm confident in significantly increasing my position size.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nLike Amazon, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is big tech company that dealt with some headwinds throughout 2023. The advertising market (making up nearly 80% of Alphabet's revenue) was soft in late 2022 and early 2023, as many advertisers cut their budgets to prepare for a recession.\n\nNow that the economic outlook has improved and Alphabet has lapped those year-over-year comparisons, it's starting to show solid growth. In Q2, Alphabet's revenue rose 11% year over year, helping its earnings per share improve from $1.06 to $1.55.\n\nThis will boost Alphabet's stock throughout 2024, but it also has another tailwind: artificial intelligence. AI is a huge investment for Alphabet, and with the launch of its latest Gemini generative AI model beating the competition on many benchmark tests, it could be a new revenue driver for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's 2024 should be solid, and investors would be wise to establish a position before it takes off.\n\n3. UiPath\n\nUiPath (NYSE: PATH) is slightly more obscure than the previous two stocks. It's focused on robotic process automation (RPA) software, which helps automate repetitive tasks within a business. UiPath is also a big AI user, as it utilizes AI to increase the tasks it can automate as well as analyze what activities employees are doing to see what could be automated.\n\nThe RPA opportunity is massive, with Polaris Market Research projecting a $66 billion market by 2032. Compared to the $2.6 billion market Polaris estimated in 2022, this software sector has a lot of growth ahead.\n\nUiPath is already a major player, with its annual recurring revenue sitting at $1.38 billion (up 24% year over year).\n\nWith UiPath growing quickly in an important market, it is a top stock pick for 2024.\n\n4. DLocal\n\nDLocal (NASDAQ: DLO) gives its clients the ability to sell to emerging market countries like Egypt, Turkey, and India. Instead of a large client (like Amazon, Shopify, or Nike) developing its own solution for these countries (which often have vastly different online payment options than in the U.S.), it can work with DLocal, which has already done the legwork to create these payment avenues.\n\nBy conceding a bit of revenue to DLocal, clients increase their market opportunity drastically and capture many important customer bases.\n\nUnsurprisingly, DLocal is growing quickly, with revenue rising 47% year over year to $164 million. However, what may come as a surprise is its profitability levels. In Q3, DLocal posted a $40.4 million profit, up 25% year over year. This is good enough for a 25% profit margin, a level few companies attain.\n\nWith DLocal recently trading for just 23 times 2023 earnings, it's great to load up before other investors discover it.\n\nThese are the stocks I'm planning on going \"all in\" on in 2024. While that doesn't mean I will sell all of the other stocks in my portfolio to fund these investments, it does mean I will channel a significant portion of my contributions to these stocks. However, I won't weight more than 10% of my portfolio to any of these companies, as anything more than that may cause me to become too worried about the position.\n\nThis figure may be smaller or larger for you, but I'm confident that a position in these four will be a solid investment for 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "10 Unsurpassed Stocks That Can Make You Richer in 2024",
        "content": "As 2023 showed, the stock market can be quite the wealth-building machine. Following the 2022 bear market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite soared by 24% and 43% in 2023, respectively.\n\nRegardless of what's thrown investors' way in the new year -- whether that be a continued march to new highs for the major indexes or the most-anticipated recession in history -- amazing deals can still be found for opportunistic investors willing to seek them out.\n\nWhat follows are 10 unsurpassed stocks that can make you richer in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nThe first superior stock with all the tools and intangibles needed to deliver for shareholders in the new year is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of world-leading internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among other ventures.\n\nThough 2023 brought concerns of an ad spending slowdown, Alphabet's insurmountable moat has insulated it from much of the tumult. In December, Google accounted for 91.61% of global internet search share. Furthermore, it's sustained at least a 90% share of worldwide monthly internet search dating back to March 2015. As long as this moat exists, Alphabet is going to generate copious amounts of cash flow that it can redirect into high-growth initiatives.\n\nSpeaking of high-growth initiatives, cloud infrastructure service Google Cloud has made the shift to recurring profitability, while YouTube, the second-most-visited social site on the planet, has enjoyed a roughly 670% increase in daily views of Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds) since 2021.\n\nAlphabet stock remains historically inexpensive and is ripe for additional upside.\n\n2. NextEra Energy\n\nAnother industry leader that can fatten investors' portfolios in 2024 is the largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE). Utilities struggled mightily last year as Treasury bond yields soared. But with the Federal Reserve expected to kick off a rate-easing cycle in the new year, utility yields are back in focus.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat separates NextEra Energy from dozens of other publicly traded electric utilities is its green-energy approach. Nearly half (34 gigawatts [GW]) of the company's 70 GW of operating capacity derives from renewables, including 23 GW from wind and 6 GW from solar, which are high-water marks for both energy sources from any utility in the world. Focusing on renewables has lowered its electricity generation costs and powered annualized adjusted earnings growth of almost 10% since 2012.\n\nFurthermore, utilities supply a basic need. Regardless of whether you own or rent, you'll likely need electricity to power your appliances and possibly HVAC system. This leads to predictable operating cash flow year in and year out.\n\n3. AT&T\n\nTelecom company AT&T(NYSE: T) is another stock that can make opportunistic investors richer in 2024. Although legacy telecom stocks were rocked by an investigative report from The Wall Street Journal in July that alleged they could face hefty replacement and environmental/health-related costs tied to their use of lead-clad cables, these claims appear to be much ado about nothing.\n\nWhat matters is that AT&T is successfully executing on an operating basis. Upgrading its network to support 5G download speeds is increasing wireless revenue, encouraging users to consume more data (data is what generates the juiciest margins for the company's wireless segment), and bolstering its aggregate number of broadband customers.\n\nAT&T has also made remarkable progress with its balance sheet. Since March 2022, the company has spun off content arm WarnerMedia, which was merged with Discovery to create Warner Bros. Discovery. This new entity took control of certain debt lots previously held by AT&T. Including organic pay-down, AT&T has reduced its net debt by more than $40 billion to $128.7 billion.\n\n4. Annaly Capital Management\n\nOne of my 10 stock market predictions for 2024 is that we'll witness what's currently the second-longest yield-curve inversion on record come to an end. A combination of dovish Federal Reserve monetary policy, coupled with a normalization of the yield curve, is an ideal environment for mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Annaly Capital Management(NYSE: NLY).\n\nThe mortgage REIT operating model involves borrowing money at short-term rates and using this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities. If interest rates decline in the new year, and the yield curve normalizes, short-term borrowing costs will fall and companies like Annaly will enjoy a higher net interest margin.\n\nAdditionally, Annaly Capital Management almost exclusively purchases agency assets. Agency securities are backed by the federal government in the event of default. What this added protection does is give Annaly the liberty of utilizing leverage to support its whopping 13.4% dividend yield. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. UnitedHealth Group\n\nA fifth unsurpassed stock that has a history of making its shareholders richer is healthcare company UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH). Based on total returns, which includes dividends paid, UnitedHealth Group has made its shareholders money in 20 of the past 22 years.\n\nMost people are familiar with UnitedHealth because of the company's health insurance segment. Even though the Affordable Care Act has sapped some of the premium pricing power for health insurers in the individual market, UnitedHealth is doing just fine with its employer-based plans and within the individual marketplace.\n\nSubsidiary Optum is an even bigger growth driver for UnitedHealth. Optum provides prescription refilling services, care delivery, and software solutions for healthcare companies, among a bevy of other solutions. Not only is Optum growing faster than the health insurance segment, but it often generates a considerably juicier operating margin.\n\n6. Alibaba\n\nWinners can be found beyond the borders of the U.S. as well. Look for e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) to sweeten investors' portfolios in 2024.\n\nThe most obvious catalyst for Alibaba is the steady return to normalcy for China's economy. China's regulators abandoned the stringent and highly controversial \"zero-COVID\" mitigation strategy in December 2022. Though it's taking a while for China's once-dominant economy to ramp up, there remains a lengthy runway for e-commerce expansion. Alibaba's online shopping sites, Taobao and Tmall, account for about 51% of China's e-commerce market, per the International Trade Administration.\n\nOn top of being an e-commerce leader, Alibaba is also the clear No. 1 in cloud infrastructure services in China. Through March 2023, Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the $7.7 billion spent on cloud infrastructure services in the first quarter. This burgeoning segment is still in its early stages of growth.\n\nWhen backing out Alibaba's mammoth cash position, it's trading at an all-time low of 5 times forward-year earnings.\n\n7. PayPal Holdings\n\nLeading fintech company PayPal Holdings(NASDAQ: PYPL) is the seventh unrivaled stock that can make you richer in the new year. Though increased competition in digital payments and above-average inflation have weighed on shares, an incredibly cheap valuation could be the catalyst that sends the stock notably higher.\n\nAmong the many performance indicators for PayPal, none are more important than its user engagement statistics. Three years ago, the average active account was completing 40.9 transactions on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. As of the end of the third quarter (Sept. 30, 2023), active accounts were nearing 57 transactions completed over the TTM. Since PayPal is predominantly a fee-driven platform, increasing the aggregate number of transactions is the easiest way to grow its gross profit.\n\nWe're also witnessing purposeful belt-tightening and shareholder-friendly moves being made by new CEO Alex Chriss and the company's board. PayPal was targeting $1.3 billion in annual operating cost reductions in 2023, and it looks to be on track to purchase around $5 billion worth of its own stock. A forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11 doesn't do justice to a company capable of sustained double-digit sales growth.\n\n8. Altria Group\n\nThough growth stocks were seemingly the flavor of the month every month in 2023, don't overlook the power of time-tested value names in 2024. High-octane dividend stocks like Altria Group(NYSE: MO), which sports a yield of nearly 10%, can make you richer this year.\n\nThe biggest issue for tobacco stocks is that as consumers have become aware of the long-term dangers of tobacco use, fewer adults have taken up the habit. Thankfully for Altria, the company behind leading premium cigarette brand Marlboro, it holds exceptional pricing power with existing smokers. Even if cigarette shipments decline, Altria's ability to raise prices can move both its sales and earnings per share higher.\n\nAltria Group is expanding into smokeless products as well. In June 2023, it closed a $2.75 billion deal to acquire electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings. What makes NJOY such a catch is that it's received a half-dozen marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its products. Whereas NJOY's e-vapor products have a green light to stay on retail shelves, the vast majority of e-vapor products don't.\n\n9. PubMatic\n\nNot all top stocks have to be household names. One company with the necessary catalysts to make you richer in 2024 is little-known adtech stock PubMatic(NASDAQ: PUBM).\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, the advertising market endured a downturn following the 2022 bear market. The good news is this slump should melt away with 2024 being an election year. Advertising agency GroupM believes U.S. political cycle ad spending will reach $16 billion this year, which would be a 31% increase over spending during the 2020 election cycle. With ad dollars shifting to digital channels, it's companies like PubMatic, which help publishers sell their digital display space, that will benefit.\n\nWhat's often overlooked with PubMatic is that the company chose to design and develop its cloud-based infrastructure instead of relying on a third-party platform. Though this was a costlier up-front decision, it'll allow the company to rapidly grow its operating margin as its revenue scales.\n\nSporting $171.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt, PubMatic is sitting pretty.\n\n10. Visa\n\nThe final unsurpassed stock that can make you richer in 2024 is payment-processing specialist Visa(NYSE: V). Despite certain money-based metrics sounding a warning for the U.S. economy and stock market, Visa has competitive edges that should help it reach new all-time highs this year.\n\nVisa is a dominant force in payment facilitation domestically, and it has a multidecade opportunity awaiting it in emerging markets. In 2021, it accounted for 52.6% of credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption). Furthermore, it can organically or acquisitively move its payment infrastructure into the Middle East, Southeastern Asia, and Africa in the coming years and decades to sustain a double-digit growth rate.\n\nVisa's success is also a function of its focus on payment processing. Visa has passed on becoming a lender, which means it doesn't have to deal with loan losses during recessions. Not having to set aside capital for credit delinquencies and loan losses during economic downturns is an undeniable competitive edge that helps its profit margin remain above 50%.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The future home of the UCLA Research Park. rendering: Hudson Pacific Properties\n\nHudson Pacific Propertiesand mall giant Macerichhave sold the projects known as One Westside and Westside Two in Los Angeles in a landmark $700 million deal with the University of California.\n\nUCLAannounced Wednesday it will transform the 687,000-square-foot property on L.A.’s Westside into a large-scale research park. This comes after CO first reported the property was set to be a life sciences redevelopment after news broke that UCLA wanted to buy the former shopping center that was intended to be a trophy office for Google (GOOGL) through 2036.\n\nThe research park will house the California Institute for Immunology and Immunotherapy at UCLA and the UCLA Center for Quantum Science and Engineering, as well as programs across the disciplines, the university said.\n\nHPP held a 75 percent interest and Macerich a 25 percent interest in the joint venture that owned the assets. Google had signed a 14-year lease that commenced in 2022 and was set to generate $43.2 million of net operating income per year for HPP. It is not immediately clear the status of that lease. The Mountain View-based company has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars cutting office leases, but that had not yet included the West Pavilion project.\n\nThe sale of 10800, 10830 and 10850 West Pico Boulevard to UC is a godsend for studio and office landlord HPP, which suffered through the Hollywood strikes last year and has been unloading underperforming office properties from its portfolio.\n\n“The opportunistic sale of One Westside and Westside Two significantly bolsters our balance sheet and we now have no debt maturities until year-end 2025,” Victor Coleman, chairman and CEO of HPP, said in a statement.\n\nMacerich CEO Tom O’Hern said net proceeds will enable his firm to “further deleverage and improve our liquidity profile, allowing us to more aggressively advance Macerich’s successful densification-diversification strategy” of adding new uses to residential, hotel and office space.\n\nStory continues\n\nUCLA has been an active buyer in commercial real estate this year. In June, the university acquired the historic Trust Building in Downtown L.A. for less than $40 million to expand with new classrooms and administration offices. UCLA also acquired a 24.5-acre campus in Rancho Palos Verdes and an 11-acre residential site in San Pedro for $80 million in January 2023.\n\nThis is a developing story.

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Boosts Pixel Watch With Watch 2 Features",
        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is making advancements to add features to its original Pixel Watch.\r\n\r\nA month ago, it was announced that this particular smartwatch would be upgraded with some of the features of the Pixel Watch 2. It has now started featuring DND and Bedtime Mode sync.\r\n\r\nUsers can avail of these features by opening the Pixel Watch companion app.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s solid efforts to strengthen its Pixel Watch series are expected to continue helping it bolster its presence in the booming smartwatch market.\r\n\r\nPer a Fortune Business Insights report, the global smartwatch market is anticipated to reach $77.22 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 14.8% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing prospects in this promising market are expected to aid it in gaining investors’ optimism in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nGrowth promises associated with Pixel Watches are expected to contribute well to the performance of Google Services segment which has been the key growth driver of the company.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s shares have gained 56.2% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 53.1%.\r\n\r\nGrowing Google Services segment is expected to continue driving its overall performance.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues is pegged at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.3%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pinned at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.7% in the past 30 days.\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nAlthough Alphabet is a late entrant in this market, its growing smartwatch efforts are likely to intensify competition for other incumbents that are leaving no stone unturned to expand footprint in the smartwatch market, like Apple AAPL and Garmin GRMN.\r\n\r\nApple, currently dominating the smartwatch market on the back of its expanding Watch family, is constantly making efforts to sustain its supremacy. The strong adoption of the Apple Watch on the back of useful and advanced features like Cycle Tracking, the Noise app and Activity Trends remains a major positive.\r\n\r\nThe company recently announced the availability of watchOS 10 to further strengthen the Apple Watch series.\r\n\r\nMore than two-thirds of the customers who purchased the Apple Watch during fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 were first-time customers.\r\n\r\nGarmin’s expanding product portfolio for the Fitness and Outdoor business, which has been built with both internal development efforts and acquisitions, makes the company a potential player in the wearable space.\r\n\r\nThe launch of its new health and fitness smartwatch called vivoactive 5 and GPS smartwatches, namely the Venu 3 and Venu 3S, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThese devices are comprised of robust healthcare features like sleep coach, which offers a sleep score and personalized coaching that keeps track of different sleep stages, naps, Pulse Ox1 and heart rate variability (“HRV”) status; morning report, which provides an overview of sleep, recovery and HRV status; nap detection, which tracks or logs naps automatically and Body Battery enhancements, which monitor energy levels throughout the day.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Another Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nAnother top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Camtek CAMT, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nCamtek shares have returned 220.4% over the past year.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its generative AI capabilities, which have been a key catalyst for the company. Alphabet’s shares have gained 56.2% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 53.1%.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing efforts to integrate generative AI into its products and services remain a major positive.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Alphabet’s recent initiatives to boost its virtual assistant, Google Assistant’s capabilities, on the back of generative AI-powered Bard, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGoogle Assistant with Bard will feature a popup window, tab switcher and updated stocks and finance widget.\r\n\r\nThis apart, Google plans to display the Assistant with Bard experience on the Discover page of the Google Search app, enabling users to switch between normal searches and AI assistance, resembling a physical slider switch.\r\n\r\nFurther, these upgrades of Assistant with Bard AI features on Google Search will also feature a popup highlighting AI's usefulness and a \"Try now\" button.\r\n\r\nNearing its launch, these Assistant with Bard feature upgrades will likely aid the company in further penetrating the booming virtual assistant market, which presents a significant growth opportunity for Alphabet.\r\n\r\nA Next Move Strategy Consulting report estimates the global virtual assistant market share to increase to $33.4 billion by 2030, witnessing a CAGR of 21.1% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

Shares of Google's parent company stand near the top of White's list of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500 stocks in January, going back 10 years. In fact, the security saw positive monthly returns during this time period seven out of ten times, boasting an 3.9% pop on average. Best of January 32024\n\nJust after the morning bell, GOOGL is down 0.9% to trade at $137.09, though it remains within a chip shot of its late-December, roughly 20-month highs above the $142 level. Plus, the shares are just off a more than 53% annual gain.\n\nFor those looking to place their bets on the blue-chip tech giant, options are affordable at the moment. This is per Alphabet stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 22% that ranks in the 8th annual percentile, which suggests options traders are pricing in lower-than-usual volatility expectations.",

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Alphabet (GOOGL) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.87 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 1, 2024.\n\nGOOGL has an Earnings ESP figure of 15.16%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.87 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62.\n\nGOOGL is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Synopsys (SNPS) as well.\n\nSynopsys is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 21, 2024. SNPS' Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.43 a share 49 days from its next earnings release.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synopsys is $3.41, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.63%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOGL and SNPS' positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "The 7 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have delivered incredible returns and crushed the market over the last year -- and the trend looks poised to continue in 2024.\n\nWhile some smaller companies will undoubtedly emerge as winners, the competitive advantages granted by infrastructure and data strengths suggest the AI race will continue to favor large players.\n\nWith that in mind, investors can best position themselves to profit from the AI revolution by building positions in today's category leaders. Read on to see why investing in these resource-rich, industry-leading companies is a great way to play AI trends in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies are at the heart of the AI revolution. When it comes to the advanced GPUs used to power AI applications, data centers, and other forms of accelerated computing, the semiconductor leader controls roughly 90% of the market. The company has entered an incredible new AI-powered growth phase, and soaring demand made it the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock over the last year.\n\nIn addition to a rock-solid demand outlook for its GPUs, Nvidia is building out its software business and offering AI computing as a service. With its hardware playing a foundational role in pushing AI forward and new business initiatives looking poised to deliver additional sales growth and very strong margins, profits are on track to continue expanding rapidly.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nAI is already powering strong performance for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). This trend is most visible in the company's Azure cloud computing business, with demand for cloud infrastructure services surging as developers launch and scale AI applications. But AI stands to benefit virtually every business under Microsoft's corporate umbrella.\n\nAI is on track to power continued advances for the company's operating systems, productivity software, search business, video games unit, and other businesses. Due to the popularity of its far-reaching product and service offerings, Microsoft also has access to tons of valuable data -- data that can be used to build and improve AI systems. Thanks to the strength of its product and services ecosystem and incredible technology resources, Microsoft stands at the top of the AI software power rankings.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Palantir\n\nFounded in 2003, Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) has had a focus on machine learning and AI technologies for over two decades. Thanks to its ability to gather and analyze valuable data to produce simulations and suggest optimal courses of action, the software specialist has won major contracts with agencies within the U.S. Department of Defense and other government organizations.\n\nThe data analytics specialist has also been rapidly attracting business customers -- and its new AI technologies look poised to power accelerating growth in the private sector. Palantir launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in May 2023. By August, over 100 organizations were using the service. And by November, AIP had a customer base spanning nearly 300 distinct organizations.\n\nWhile Palantir stock has been red hot, rising roughly 160% over the last year, it's still down 57% from its high. For long-term investors, this AI growth stock has the potential to be a massive winner.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nWhile most of Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) revenue comes from its e-commerce business, the large majority of its profits come from Amazon Web Services (AWS). With demand for cloud infrastructure and other tools used to power AI applications poised to surge, Amazon could see sales growth for its most profitable business segment start to reaccelerate.\n\nBut AI will likely also power incredible improvements for the company's e-commerce business. With AI tech paving the way for increased factory automation and autonomous deliveries, margins for the online retail business could see dramatic improvements. If that happens, profits from Amazon's massive e-commerce could soar and power incredible gains for the stock.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike other top tech players, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has big advantages in AI thanks to the breadth of its software offerings and access to massive troves of valuable data.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 11 high growth low debt stocks to buy. To skip our analysis of the recent trends, and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy.\n\nWe have discussed high growth, low debt stocks in this article which are available at attractive prices and present promising opportunities for investment. For the purpose of our article, we have chosen EPS growth as the main factor to identify high growth stocks, from a myriad of possible metrics that could have been chosen, such as revenue growth, EBITDA growth, etc. We have defined high growth company as one where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 15% over the next 5 years.\n\nIn terms of low debt, we have picked companies that have debt to equity ratios lower than 0.50. Companies typically use debt to finance their operations or to acquire assets. Utilization of debt for business purposes can help a company add value if used correctly. Incorrect usage of debt, on the other hand, has the potential to destroy value. Some companies and some industries can take on more debt than others depending on the fundamentals.\n\nLow debt on balance sheets bodes well for the future possibility of the company remaining operational through existing financial resources as well as a comparatively greater ability to raise debt, if required, in the future at competitive rates. These companies are also better off in periods of economic downturn as they have low financial obligations to meet.\n\nAnother important factor that we have considered for our selection of stocks for this list pertains to the competitive advantage of the stocks we have picked. Competitive advantages require time to be developed and honed and require excellence ranging from product development to strategy execution and marketing and distribution.\n\nTypically, stocks can have two kinds of competitive advantages in terms of the longevity of the advantages. Wide moat companies –likely to sustain their competitive advantage for at least the next 20 years; and narrow moat companies – more likely than not to sustain their competitive advantage for at least 10 years into the future. The Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index is an index that focuses on companies with wide moat ratings trading at the lowest current market price, according to Morningstar Equity Research team. The index generated a total return of 22.75% in 2023 and an annual return of 13.13% during the last 10 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe United States stock market continues to rally with optimism related to interest rates. Investor confidence has been on an upward trajectory since the end of October following optimism about interest rates policies. On November 28, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said that he’s “increasingly confident” that the monetary policy is in the right place to bring inflation down to 2%. Major stock indices have posted consecutive weeks of positive performance with the S&P 500 slated to have one of its best months since July 2022. You can read more about the recent interest rate cuts which have led to the latest rally in the stock markets here. High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy\n\nA panoramic view of a busy stock exchange floor, filled with traders analyzing the market.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of 11 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy, we chose 11 stocks with competitive advantages that have an estimated average annual EPS growth rate of over 15% a year for the next 5 years according to FINVIZ.com.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet was a top contributor to performance as search revenues accelerated during their second quarter. This improved performance flies in the face of fears that demand for the Company's advertising inventory and core search functionality would be diluted by the Company's own generative-AI offerings and outside substitutes. Alphabet subsidiaries have been at the vanguard of artificial intelligence for more than a decade. The Company has spent almost $150 billion on research and development over just the past five years, and today over 80% of the Company's advertising customers use an AI-enabled tool when they run their Google Search and YouTube campaigns. Thus, Alphabet is certainly not \"behind the curve\" in any way, shape, or form when it comes to AI. Quite the contrary, the Company has ample room to rationalize spending to drive better returns on investments and increase capital returns to shareholders at these relatively attractive forward earnings multiples.”\n\n7.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) have increased by 80% and 60%, respectively. According to the financial media, an AI-related bull run will continue in 2024.

Morgan Stanley researchers believe that digital products' seamless adoption of AI would shift consumers' gravitation towards online experiences rather than offline ones.\n\nMain Street Research chief investment officer James Demmert, a 30-year investing veteran, predicts a massive rally in AI stocks in 2024 that he believes will last for the next decade. He anticipates the upward trend will continue due to the increased productivity brought about by AI. He stated the following about the AI-related bull run:\n\n\"The market's recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI. Experienced investors know that this kind of broad based strength across all sectors and capitalizations is reminiscent of the first year of previous bull markets that has much further to run, with inevitable corrections along the way. We urge investors not to allow the market's recent strength to scare you out of stocks or prevent you from participating. Adding stocks during any kind of market pullback is the correct strategy at this early stage of the bull market. The fundamentals here are very appealing and likely long-lasting for years not months.”\n\nStory continues\n\nUBS characterized generative artificial intelligence as a potentially disruptive and revolutionary technology in a note. UBS added that the introduction of new technologies has contributed significantly to a wide range of industries in history and that generative AI has the potential to boost the entire economy.\n\n“Stocks have already rallied hard in anticipation of higher AI demand, yet we think companies across the AI value chain from cloud to semis, software, and internet, will further run, both in 2024 and over the longer term.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024 and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Although 2023 was a stellar year for the stock market, volatility has been the name of the game for much of the past four years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began.\n\nWhen volatility picks up on Wall Street, professional and everyday investors have a tendency to seek out companies that offer a history of outperformance. For the past two and a half years, it's stocks enacting splits that have fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn simple terms, a stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact on its market cap or operations. Think of it as a purely cosmetic procedure that can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors (i.e., a forward-stock split), or can increase a publicly traded company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (i.e., a reverse stock split).\n\nWhile there are instances of companies conducting reverse-stock splits and going on to deliver big-time gains for their shareholders (e.g., Booking Holdings), most investors are laser-focused on companies conducting forward-stock splits. That's because forward splits are enacted by high-flying companies that have often out-innovated and handily out-executed their competition.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, nine prominent companies have completed a forward-stock split:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 split Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 20-for-1 split DexCom(NASDAQ: DXCM): 4-for-1 split Shopify(NYSE: SHOP): 10-for-1 split Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 20-for-1 split Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 3-for-1 split Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW): 3-for-1 split Monster Beverage(NASDAQ: MNST): 2-for-1 split Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO): 2-for-1 split NVDA Chart\n\nEvery single one of these businesses is a dominant player with well-defined competitive advantages in their respective industries. For example, Nvidia's graphics processing units are the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Amazon accounts for roughly 40% of U.S. online retail sales, Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, and DexCom is a top-two producer of continuous glucose monitoring systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the individual outlooks for these nine stock-split stocks differs greatly in 2024 (and beyond). Whereas one stock-split stock is historically inexpensive and primed for additional upside, another highflier appears to be headed for a breakdown.\n\nThe stock-split stock to buy hand over fist in 2024: Alphabet\n\nThough all nine of these prominent companies have run circles around the benchmark S&P 500 over the long run, it's Alphabet that stands out as the stock-split stock to buy hand over fist in the new year. Alphabet is the parent company of popular internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.\n\nThe biggest \"problem\" (if you want to call it that) for Alphabet is that it's cyclical. Approximately 78% of the company's third-quarter revenue is derived from advertising. When the slightest hint of trouble is detected by businesses, it's not uncommon for them to quickly pare back their ad spending. This leaves Alphabet susceptible to weakness during recessions. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest an economic downturn is in the cards for 2024.\n\nHowever, this is a two-sided coin that's far from proportionate. Though it's true that recessions are a perfectly normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, only three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months. Further, not a single one has surpassed 18 months.\n\nBy comparison, most economic expansions endure multiple years, with two periods of post-World-War-II growth lasting more than a decade. In short, ad-driven businesses are well positioned to succeed as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nAlphabet's clearest competitive advantage has long been its search engine, Google. In November, Google totaled 91.54% of worldwide search share, according to data from GlobalStats. You'd have to go back to March 2015 to find the last month Google hasn't accounted for at least 90% of global internet search share. Being the undisputed go-to for advertisers wanting to reach users has afforded the company exceptional ad-pricing power in virtually any economic climate. This moat isn't going away in 2024.\n\nThe new year should also feature double-digit growth opportunities for two of Alphabet's fast-growing ancillary segments. YouTube is the second most visited social site in the world, with more than 2.7 billion monthly active users. Rapid growth in Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds) should put ad-pricing power in YouTube's corner.\n\nThere's also Google Cloud, which has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, based on estimates from Canalys, as of the third quarter. Enterprise cloud spending still has a long growth runway, and Google Cloud looks to have made the permanent shift to recurring profitability.\n\nDespite sustained double-digit earnings growth potential over the next five years (if not well beyond), Alphabet stock can be purchased for roughly 14 times estimated cash flow per share in 2024. That's a 20% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the past five years. The Model 3 is Tesla's top-selling sedan. Image source: Tesla.\n\nThe stock-split stock worth avoiding in 2024: Tesla\n\nTo quote the most famous investment disclaimer on Wall Street: \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\" Although EV maker Tesla has made a habit of proving naysayers wrong for more than a decade, it's the clear stock-split stock to avoid in 2024 for a variety of reasons.\n\nBefore digging into those reasons, allow me to give credit where credit is due. As of right now, Tesla is the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's profitable on a recurring basis. While there are other profitable automakers, none of the legacy companies are generating a recurring profit from their electric-only divisions. When Tesla reports its fourth-quarter operating results, I'd expect it to wrap up its fourth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit.\n\nUnfortunately for the world's largest automaker by market cap, its first-mover advantages are beginning to wane, and there are very evident cracks in its foundation.\n\nThe most front-and-center evidence that Tesla is in trouble can be seen via its operating margin, which has been more than halved to 7.6% over the trailing year, ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn 2023, North America's leading EV company slashed prices on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions. Based on comments provided by CEO Elon Musk during the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, these price cuts were based solely on demand. With vehicle inventory levels rising, it's plainly evident that demand for the company's EVs has declined. It also suggests that additional price cuts may be necessary to keep inventory levels under control as Tesla continues to ramp up its production.\n\nAnother potential problem with Tesla is how it's deriving its income. During the third quarter, Tesla booked $554 million in profit from selling renewable energy credits given to it for free by governments. It also generated $282 million in interest income from its sizable cash pile. That's $836 million in pre-tax income -- 41% of the company's pre-tax income in the third quarter -- that can be traced back to unsustainable sources.\n\nAlthough Elon Musk is a big reason Tesla has been such a success since going public in 2010, he's also a genuine liability for shareholders. Putting aside that he's drawn the attention of securities regulators on a couple of occasions, his biggest flaw is that he regularly overpromises new innovations (including new EVs) and fails to deliver them. Tesla's enormous valuation looks to be based on countless promises from Musk that remain unfulfilled.\n\nLastly, Tesla's efforts to become more than a car company have mostly missed the mark. Its ancillary segments generate low margins, while auto margins continue to fall. Whereas most auto stocks trade between 6 and 8 times forward-year earnings, Tesla is valued at 65 times consensus earnings in 2024. That's not a valuation that's going to hold up in the face of a rapidly declining operating margin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Futures edge lower, Tesla's China-made EV sales surge - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point lower on Wednesday after a mostly downbeat start to 2024 in the prior session. Markets are now awaiting the publication of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting and, with it, potential clues into the central bank's interest rate path in the coming months. Elsewhere, sales of Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) China-made cars soar in December, but Elon Musk's electric vehicle giant is still grappling with fierce competition in the country.\n\n1. Futures inch lower\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down on Wednesday, as investors looked ahead to the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.\n\nBy 05:09 ET (10:09 GMT), the Dow futures contract had dipped by 56 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had shed 11 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had fallen by 76 points or 0.4%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both lost ground in the first day of trading of 2024, weighed down in part by ebbing hopes that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts early this year. Meanwhile, the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just under 0.1%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sunk by around 4% after analysts at Barclays downgraded their rating of the iPhone maker, citing weak hardware demand and concerns over revenue at its services division. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- who, along with Apple, form part of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech firms that helped drive a stellar 2023 for stocks -- also declined.\n\n\"The impressive rally into year[-]end has faded a bit despite the seasonal tailwinds, but we expect the loss of short[-]term momentum to be modest,\" analysts at Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients.\n\n2. U.S. Treasury yields climb\n\nAlso denting stocks on Tuesday was a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, in a possible sign that markets' excitement over the prospect of Fed rate cuts early this year may be easing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year note -- a key gauge of long-term estimates for borrowing costs -- briefly touched an over two-week high, while the yield rate-sensitive 2-year also moved up. Prices typically fall as yields increase.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield was under 3.9% following a strong rally to cap off the year that was driven by expectations for early Fed rate cuts and a so-called \"soft landing\" for the U.S. economy. In this scenario, the Fed's aggressive rate hiking campaign successfully cools inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.\n\nBolstered by the jump in Treasury yields, the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its currency pairs, had its best daily performance since March 2023.\n\n3. Fed minutes ahead\n\nTraders are now turning their attention to the minutes from the Fed's December gathering, which are due out at 19:00 GMT on Wednesday.\n\nHow officials see borrowing costs evolving in the coming months could factor into the staying power of recent bets that the U.S. central bank will soon begin to bring down interest rates from a more than two-decade high.\n\nIn December, the Fed left rates unaltered at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, but signaled that its unprecedented tightening cycle aimed at corraling elevated inflation may have peaked. New forecasts from policymakers also suggested that they may slash rates by 75 basis points this year, an outlook that was more dovish than prior projections.\n\nSpeculation over potential rate reductions fueled a late-year surge in stocks, although many officials have since attempted to temper this enthusiasm. The minutes could provide even more insight into the Fed's thinking.\n\n4. Sales of Tesla's China-made EVs surge in December\n\nSales of Tesla's electric vehicles (EVs) made in China surged by 68.7% on a yearly basis last month, new data from the China Passenger Car Association showed on Wednesday, although the U.S. carmaker still faces intense competition in the country.\n\nThe December total, which includes exports, brought Tesla's annual amount of China-made sales up to 947,742 -- just over half of the company's global deliveries.\n\nTesla's Shanghai plant is its largest production hub, supplying China and other countries like New Zealand and Australia. The group has outlined plans to expand its EV capacity at the factory, but the move has yet to receive regulatory approval from Beijing.\n\nThe latest CPCA numbers come after China's BYD (SZ:002594) unseated Tesla as the world's biggest EV maker earlier this week. BYD, who offers both battery-only and hybrid options, delivered 341,043 passenger cars in December, an increase of 45% year-on-year.\n\n5. Oil slips\n\nOil prices retreated Wednesday, ahead of the release of crucial weekly inventories data from the U.S., the world’s largest consumer.\n\nBy 05:09 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $69.94 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.5% to $75.53 per barrel.\n\nU.S. crude stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute industry group are due later Wednesday, a day later than usual due to Monday’s New Year’s holiday. Official data will then be published on Thursday.\n\nThe crude benchmarks had climbed sharply earlier in the week after attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels raised concerns over potential supply disruptions through this key region.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures edge lower, Tesla's China-made EV sales surge - what's moving markets\n\nFed minutes may elaborate on coming rate cut debate\n\nPoliticisation of trade is immoral and unsustainable, China says",

        "content": "In the latest market close, Alphabet (GOOGL) reached $138.17, with a -1.09% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.57%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.07%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.64%.\n\nThe internet search leader's stock has climbed by 8.06% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.46% and the S&P 500's gain of 4%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alphabet in its upcoming release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.62, up 54.29% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $70.59 billion, up 11.83% from the year-ago period.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.44% higher. Currently, Alphabet is carrying a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Alphabet is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.72. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 24.62.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also important to note that GOOGL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.25. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Internet - Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.08.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 44, positioning it in the top 18% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Can 'Magnificent Seven' continue dominating markets in 2024?",
        "content": "The high-flying 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech stocks that powered markets in 2023 seem poised to extend their leadership in 2024. According to FactSet data, six of the seven including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are projected to rise double-digits this year, with only a negative return seen for Tesla (TSLA).\n\nYahoo Finance's Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So let's stick with the Magnificent Seven here because we know they drove record market gains in 2023. And Wall Street, optimistic the tech giants can keep that momentum going in the new year. According to estimates compiled by FactSet, the Street is projecting the Magnificent Seven stocks will rise an average of 11% in the new year, with the exception of laggard Tesla.\n\nSo as you mentioned, Julia, this is sort of that time of year, you rethink your portfolio maybe a bit. You think you know what, do I stick with the winners, right? And certainly the Magnificent Seven winners in 2023. If you piled in 12 months ago, you're probably feeling pretty good and pretty smart right about now. And there were different reasons those stocks worked last year.\n\nYou could think about AI, certainly these were companies that put so much time and effort and money into that tech, and they began to integrate that tech across their product portfolios.\n\nAnother reason obviously, some investors piled in because they thought they were defensive, right? They saw they were relatively predictable strong moats, strong balance sheets. Warren Buffett likes some of them. He's a pretty smart guy. So now the question is, do you think do you stick with that trade as we head into the new year?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, most strategists are sticking with that trade, at least the individual analysts who cover these stocks, if we look at those price targets, except for Tesla, they're all on average looking for upside here. That said, they're all expecting less upside than we saw last year without exception. All of those Magnificent Seven stocks, if you calculate the change from the close on Friday, last Friday, to the price target, we're talking about a smaller gain than they saw in 2023, or in Tesla's case, a loss.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it is optimism, but it's more muted optimism going into this year. One of the folks who's a macro person, who looks at this is David Costner over at Goldman Sachs. He says the baseline is that mega-cap tech stocks will continue to outperform the remainder of the S&P 500, although it should be said, the forecast for the S&P overall, there's a big range, but most of them are also for modest gains in the index.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: There are some, you know, dedicated tech bulls, though, who are you people are being too conservative. And I think it comes down to where the AI. And they see these companies-- and this is the very bullish case. They see these companies continuing to invest. They're going to keep integrating that tech across their products, across their services, and they just are making a bet that use cases and monetization is going to keep ramping.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. A couple of individual things that I just quickly want to mention that's going on today. One of them is that Apple shares are trading lower. They got an a rating over from Barclays that is pushing the shares down.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Very rare downgrade to sell--\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yes, exactly.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: --the iPhone. But you don't see that very often.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Time for a breather, they say. So we're going to talk more about this later, but you could argue given the size of Apple as Apple goes--\n\nJOSH LIPTON: For sure.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: --the rest of tech, and then the rest of the market goes. So that's definitely weighing on things today. On the flip side, you've got Tesla, which is out with deliveries, we're going to talk more about that later as well. And so even though the forecast is for it to decline on the year, it had been higher earlier today.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Because they beat. They beat consensus.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Now off by 2/3.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: We'll keep watching that one.",

        "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures saw little movement during Tuesday's overnight trading, following the NASDAQ Composite's most severe declines since October.\n\nBy 6:30 pm ET (11:30 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures and S&P 500 Futures remained little changed while Nasdaq 100 Futures ticked 0.1% higher.\n\nBloomin Brands Inc (NASDAQ:BLMN), the company behind Outback Steakhouse, experienced a more than 3% rise after announcing the addition of two new members to its board. This move was in line with an agreement the company made with activist investor, Starboard Value.\n\nThe commencement of the new year experienced a downturn in stocks, with the S&P 500 falling 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average merely edging up by less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite recorded a drop of more than 1.6%, marking its worst day since October. This decline was largely due to a slump in major technology stocks and a near 4% decline in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), following a downgrade by Barclays (LON:BARC).\n\nCompanies that are poised to benefit from artificial intelligence, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), experienced drops of 2.7% and 6% respectively. Meanwhile, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), both leaders in chatbot technology, lost over 1%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fell by 3.4%, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) saw a 4.9% decrease.\n\nChris Verrone from Strategas noted on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday that the burden of proof is on the bears as we start the year. He pointed out that short-term corrections are not unusual in a market that's coming off of fresh highs and entering primary season. He also noted that the longer-term setup looks positive on a six- to twelve-month horizon.\n\nThe market is recovering from a remarkable year that witnessed all the major averages rebounding from a devastating 2022. The S&P 500 surged by over 24%, marking its longest weekly winning streak since 2004, while the Nasdaq jumped 43% for its best year since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shift back into risk assets was driven by easing inflation and a drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, which finished the year below 3.9% after reaching 5% in October. The end of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive hiking campaign and anticipation of rate cuts in 2024, along with increased hopes for a soft landing, has also boosted market sentiment in recent weeks.\n\nThe minutes from the Fed's December policy meeting, due out Wednesday, and comments from Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, could provide additional insight into the rate path ahead before the central bank meets later this month. The job openings report for November and December's ISM manufacturing data are also set for release later in the session.\n\nOn the bond markets, United States 10-Year rates were at 3.947%.\n\nUpgrade your decision-making with InvestingPro+!

(GOOG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 7.99%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Alphabet Inc. Came out with earnings of $1.55 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 per share, representing a surprise of 6.90%.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in January",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded in 2023 and shows no signs of slowing. The debut of ChatGPT reignited interest in the sector and forced many to rethink what they thought was currently possible with the technology. As a result, countless companies pivoted their businesses to developing the industry.\n\nData from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That would see it hit annual sales exceeding $1 trillion before the decade's end. That makes now a great time to invest in this rapidly expanding industry and potentially profit from its promising outlook.\n\nHere are three AI stocks you might want to consider buying hand over fist in January.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has an exciting year ahead, with plans to strengthen its role in AI by launching a new chip. The company will begin shipping its MI300X graphics processing unit (GPU) in 2024, designed specifically to challenge Nvidia's dominance.\n\nNvidia soared to the top of the market in 2023, getting a headstart as it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. Its success in the industry highlighted how far chipmakers like AMD are behind when it comes to AI.\n\nHowever, AMD spent the last 12 months refining its AI technology and it's hoping to make a big splash in the sector this year. As the cost of AI chips rises, the industry is desperate for increased competition and alternatives to Nvidia. Consequently, AMD's MI300X has support from firms across tech, with Microsoft's Azure announcing in December that it will become the first cloud platform to use the new GPU to optimize its AI offerings. AMD EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe chart above shows AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2025. When that figure is multiplied by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 55, it gives a stock price of $275, suggesting growth of 87% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD is on a promising growth trajectory and could be one of the smartest investments this month.\n\n2. Intel\n\nLike AMD, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) is hard at work designing a new AI chip to take on Nvidia in 2024. In December the company unveiled several new additions to its product lineup, including the Gaudi3, which is launching this year and is capable of powering demanding AI models.\n\nIntel has transformed itself over the last few years. A long history of dominance in central processing units (CPUs) saw it grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to competition. Its CPU market share fell from 82% to 61% between 2017 and 2023 as AMD strengthened its position in the industry. Then in 2020, Apple ended its partnership with Intel in favor of in-house hardware, taking a significant bite out of the chipmaker's earnings.\n\nHowever, instead of throwing in the towel, the hurdles seemed to light a fire under Intel again. The company unveiled its first consumer GPUs in October 2022, venturing into a new market that would see it go head-to-head with Nvidia and AMD. The move was a smart one in the run-up to the boom in AI, as GPU technology is crucial to its success in the industry over the long term. INTC EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIntel's massive growth potential is evident in its EPS estimates. This chart shows its earnings are projected to reach nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to AMD, multiplying the figure by Intel's forward P/E of 53 yields a stock price of $140. If the estimates hold, the company's shares would deliver growth of 180% by fiscal 2025.\n\nAs a result, Intel is absolutely an AI stock worth buying hand over fist this January.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) enjoyed a glowing 2023. Its digital ad business made an impressive turnaround from the previous year, with revenue rising 11% year over year in its latest quarter (the third quarter of 2023) as it beat analysts' expectations by $980 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech giant has exciting prospects in AI. Alphabet's highly anticipated large language model Gemini debuted in early December, and is capable of crunching various forms of data with more sophisticated reasoning than any of the company's previous technology.\n\nGemini and Alphabet's potent platforms, like Google Search and Android, could prove a powerful combination, presenting countless ways for the company to expand in AI. Alongside free cash flow that rose 29% over the last year to $77 billion, Alphabet has the financial resources and brand loyalty to go far in the industry. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nAlphabet's biggest competitors in AI are cloud giants Amazon and Microsoft. However, Gemini and Alphabet's massive user base suggests the company has equal, if not more, earnings potential in AI. Meanwhile, this chart shows Alphabet's P/E and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, making its stock a bargain compared to Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nAlphabet likely has a bright future in AI and is a no-brainer investment this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is making solid initiatives to strengthen YouTube TV offerings. Its deepening focus on boosting its sports content on YouTube is a plus.\r\n\r\nIts continuous efforts to discount the NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV remain noteworthy. NFL Sunday Ticket is a package that provides access to out-of-market NFL games to YouTube TV subscribers and general YouTube users.\r\n\r\nRecently, the company slashed the NFL Sunday Ticket price to $39 for the rest of the 23/24 NFL regular season. It excludes anything beyond the regular season, such as playoffs.\r\n\r\nAlong with the NFL RedZone postgame coverage, the price is $44.\r\n\r\nThe latest price cut follows the first such incident, which happened in November 2023 when Google discounted the NFL Sunday Ticket to $174.\r\n\r\nThese price cuts are pretty steep compared with the original price of $349, which came on top of the subscription price of YouTube TV.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nAlphabet’s Prospects\n\nWith the discounting strategy, Google will be able to attract more subscribers to YouTube TV, which will boost its viewer base.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, will contribute well to GOOGL’s Other revenues, consisting of Google Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues, which will ultimately drive growth in Alphabet’s Google services’ revenues in the upcoming period.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the Google Services segment is expected to benefit GOOGL’s overall performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nGoogle Services contributes the most to total revenues and has been Alphabet's primary growth driver. Shares of the company have gained 56.7% over a year, outperforming the S&P 500 index’s rally of 25.2%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $283.39 billion, indicating growth of 11.3% year over year. The figure excludes the effect of Google’s traffic acquisition costs.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pinned at $6.74 per share, indicating growth of 15.6% year over year. The figure moved north by 0.7% in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nAlphabet presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nWith the NFL Sunday Ticket, Google remains well-poised to penetrate the booming sports streaming space.\r\n\r\nPer data from GROWTH Market Reports, the global online live video sports streaming market is expected to reach $101.2 billion by 2031, witnessing a CAGR of 24.8% between 2023 and 2031.\r\n\r\nGiven the upbeat scenario, Alphabet and other companies, including Amazon AMZN, Disney DIS and Comcast CMCSA, are some noteworthy players in this promising market.\r\n\r\nAmazon recently revealed leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to improve the streaming of Thursday Night Football (TNF) of NFL on Prime Video.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company came up with TNF’s weekly alternate stream called Prime Vision, which shows various graphics on the screen during the game to allow viewers to see real-time stats and analysis.\r\n\r\nThe e-commerce giant introduced new features like defensive alerts, Prime Targets, Fourth Down Territory, Field Goal Target Zones and Key Plays, designed to enable fans to dive deeper into the game analytics.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Disney’s focus on sports streaming, particularly Live Sports, remains noteworthy. For instance, ESPN+ streams tournaments like the UFC Lightweight Championship, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam tennis, Italy’s Serie A soccer and live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Peacock, owned by NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast, streams games under the Sunday Night Football package and Premier League Soccer.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL is bolstering its search engine on the back of new feature updates of the Chrome browser, which has been a key growth driver for the company. Alphabet’s shares have rallied 16.5% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 10.3%.\r\n \r\nIn regard to advancing Chrome, Google’s recent Material You redesign for Chrome’s New Tab Page on Android remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe Chrome app on Android now boasts a thicker search bar, similar to Google Search, and features bolder hint text, distinct voice microphone and Lens icons and a smaller Google logo. The 4x2 grid of frequently visited sites is rounded.\r\n\r\nThese features are expected to boost traffic on the Chrome browser. Moreover, Alphabet is expected to gain solid traction across Android users on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nMore on Google Chrome\n\nApart from the latest move, Alphabet added 120 features to Google Chrome, including Tab Groups for easy access on other desktop devices and Safety Check, which automatically runs in the background to alert users when saved passwords are compromised or harmful extensions are installed.\r\n\r\nEarlier to this, Google introduced Material You redesigns for desktop Chrome. The redesign features rounded corners, taller tab strips, bookmarks and a new icon for site controls and information in the Omnibox.\r\n\r\nThe company unveiled in-browser price insights across Chrome, allowing users to predict future price changes. The feature also features a 90-day price history graph, price drop emails and a new Shopping list folder.\r\n\r\nGoogle is set to introduce an AI-powered “Help me write” feature to Chrome for Desktop use. This new AI feature will be available in Chrome's autofill popup, providing context on text content rather than relying solely on the prompt.\r\n\r\nAlso, the company is developing a new feature called \"Create Theme with AI\" for Chrome, which allows users to create custom themes using AI. The feature enables users to select a subject, art style, mood and color options for their theme.\n\nStory continues\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAlphabet’s growing endeavors to bolster its Google Chrome app will boost Google’s Search revenues. This, in turn, is expected to bolster the Google Services segment that accounts for the majority of GOOGL’s total revenues.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.26%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.74 per share, which has risen by 5 cents in the past 30 days.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Camtek CAMT, KT KT and Everbridge EVBG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "title": "Got $5,000? These 2 Growth Stocks Are Smart Buys.",
        "content": "Growth stocks are known for their potential to rapidly increase in value. They come with a risk-reward trade-off, but for investors who can stomach the volatility that typically comes with them, growth stocks can be real moneymakers over time.\n\nThe key is patience.\n\nNot all growth stocks have to be speculative or high-risk, either. Some growth stocks also provide investors with relative stability. If you have $5,000 to invest, the following two growth stocks are great options because of their market-beating potential.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been one of the stock market's quintessential growth stocks for quite some time. A $10,000 investment at its May 1997 initial public offering would be worth over $15.5 million today. You can't ask for much more growth than that.\n\nEven with its generational returns, Amazon is well positioned to continue growing at a good rate. Of course, its e-commerce business made it a household name, but Amazon has its hand in several industries that are still growing, including artificial intelligence, healthcare, and cloud services.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's true moneymaker, accounting for most of its profit. AWS is the leading cloud service provider, with a 31% market share as of the third quarter of 2023. That's a 1% drop from recent quarters, but I don't believe that's a cause for concern.\n\nThe cloud computing market is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 17.8% from 2023 to 2032, according to Acumen Research and Consulting. Even growing at that rate could expand AWS and boost Amazon's profits. AMZN Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon Prime Video could be an underrated growth area for Amazon. Although it has been around since September 2006, recent moves such as buying the rights to the NFL's Thursday Night Football and investing heavily in expanding its original content have put Amazon Prime Video in a competitive position.\n\nAmazon received some backlash when it announced it would begin showing ads on Amazon Prime Video (or you can pay $2.99 per month to avoid ads), but I don't see that having a tangible effect on its growth. Realistically, it was only a matter of time.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving access to your shopping data and then being able to show you relevant ads on Amazon Prime Video is the type of integration that I'm sure Amazon has been seeking. Its e-commerce business could see an assist from the move.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), didn't have the monster year that big tech growth stocks such as Nvidia or Amazon had, but you can't beat 58% returns in a year.\n\nGoogle advertising is undoubtedly Alphabet's most important business, accounting for more than 77% of its revenue in the third quarter of 2023. That's less than the 80% it accounted for three years ago, showing that other segments such as cloud and \"Other Bets\" (which includes Waymo) are beginning to pick up steam.\n\nGoogle Cloud has grown impressively, making up 11% of Alphabet's revenue in the third quarter. It's still firmly in third place in cloud service market share (11%), trailing AWS and Microsoft's Azure, but this is a notable increase from its 6% market share in 2017. Much like AWS, Google Cloud should see a boost from overall industry growth in the coming years.\n\nThere's also an argument to be made that Alphabet stock is currently undervalued, especially when you look at the free cash flow the company generates. Its free cash flow outpaces tech giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. This gives Alphabet plenty of cash leeway to invest aggressively in emerging technologies, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase shares. GOOGL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nWith a price-to-free cash flow ratio of around 23.5, Alphabet trades at a significant discount to its peers. There may be legitimate concerns about Alphabet's reliance on Google advertising and antitrust scrutiny, but Alphabet is still positioned to return significant shareholder value for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Potentially Undervalued?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Alphabet’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhat Is Alphabet Worth?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 5.2% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Alphabet today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $147.31, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Alphabet’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nCan we expect growth from Alphabet? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 57% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in GOOGL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIt can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Alphabet from their most recent forecasts.

        "title": "Investing Preview 2024: Buy These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Avoid the Others.",
        "content": "Any investing exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks has made your 2023 investing year a big success. This group of mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), has outperformed the broader market despite the Nasdaq Composite surging over 45% last year.\n\nIf it's not broken, don't fix it... right? Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023.\n\n1. Nvidia: Buy\n\nNvidia's chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That's pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAI demand doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia's valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That's a PEG ratio of just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023.\n\n2. Apple: Avoid\n\nNot every \"Magnificent Seven\" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple's revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple's business can be cyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That's fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAnalysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta Platforms: Buy\n\nWall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business, harmful privacy changes to iPhones, and expensive metaverse projects that weren't showing any return on investment. Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs, working through the iPhone challenges, and getting revenue growth and profits back on track. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAstonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta is still a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond.\n\n4. Microsoft: Avoid\n\nChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world's largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it's becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillion market cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock's resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn't as appealing as some other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nIt's not abhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop, there are better deals out there. It's OK for investors to be picky.\n\n5. Amazon: Buy\n\nInterestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the past decade, that's over 20% below Amazon's average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing in developing its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That's not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail).\n\n6. Tesla: Avoid\n\nElectric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It's a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla's operating results. Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year. TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it's striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla's future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla's stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy.\n\n7. Alphabet: Buy\n\nAlphabet's dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world's most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock's 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks dominated the market in 2023. The worst performer in the group, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), rose 49%, and the best, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), jumped nearly 240%. But with such strong runs behind them, do any of them have room left to grow in 2024?\n\nThe answer: Yes, and some are still worth buying at their current prices.\n\nApple and Nvidia are both richly valued for their performance\n\nI'm breaking the seven up into buy, sell, and hold groups. Starting with the sell set, I think Apple and Nvidia's stock prices far outpaced their businesses.\n\nNvidia's 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, and its business has responded in kind. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), revenue rose 206% year over year. Furthermore, management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue, up 231%. The stock's movement was warranted given the company's sales growth, but I'm concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\n\nNvidia goes through boom and bust cycles, and right now is certainly a boom. However, it's unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term. If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly, the stock may come crashing back down to earth. Plus, it's trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, Apple is the opposite of Nvidia. Its sales declined throughout 2023. Even so, its stock skyrocketed. This makes little sense, and more headwinds are coming up: a U.S. International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume). With all this in mind, 2024 could be a tough year for the company. And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than \"Magnificent Seven\" members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), it doesn't make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft and Tesla need to show me some results\n\nI view Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently. Microsoft had a strong year, as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose. However, Microsoft trades at a steep premium, even on a forward earnings basis. MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nMicrosoft is executing well, but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying. Still, it's far from a sell.\n\nTesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street, as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products. It's also set to face some added headwinds. Starting in 2024, some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them.\n\nWhen judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock, I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends. For Tesla, these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022. TSLA PE Ratio Chart\n\nI'm taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesn't look like a bargain at these prices.\n\nAdvertising should bounce back in 2024\n\nThat leaves Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category. These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year.\n\nEven though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments, they are mostly advertising businesses. In 2022 and 2023, the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming. However, now that we have lapped that pullback, Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses. Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24%, respectively, in Q3.\n\nNext year should be another strong recovery year for advertising, which will boost both companies.\n\nAmazon has also had a strong 2023, with its margins rising. AMZN Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nHowever, this chart doesn't tell the full story, as this takes into account Amazon's profits over the past 12 months. If you focus on its latest quarterly results, Amazon's margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4, which is usually its strongest one. No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, but 2024 could give us a glimpse, making it a strong buy now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 FAANG Stocks to Buy in 2024 and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "The stock market has soared over the last decade. A $10,000 investment made in a market-tracking fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) at the start of 2014 would be worth $29,673 today after having grown at a compound annual rate of 11.6%, assuming that dividends were reinvested along the way.\n\nBut the handful of elite stocks known as the FAANG group has delivered even stronger returns. In the last decade, an equal-weighted and dividend-reinvested portfolio of these five stocks would have grown from $10,000 to $89,051. That's a mind-blowing 24.7% compound annual growth rate. It was a bumpy ride, as the FAANG portfolio outperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracker in five years and underperformed in the other five, but stellar results of 2015, 2020, and 2023 outweighed the weak 2022 period.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with FAANG, I'm talking about these familiar companies:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google.\n\nThe mildest 10-year gain among these top-shelf stocks was 400% for Alphabet. At the other end of the scale, Apple led the way with an 867% share price increase. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker is also the only dividend payer of the bunch; reinvesting those payouts would have lifted an investor's total return on Apple stock to a cool 1,000% in 10 years.\n\nBut even the members of this exclusive club aren't always indisputable buys. Right now, I see two excellent investment opportunities for 2024 in this bunch, but one that investors should avoid until further notice.\n\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 1: Alphabet\n\nThe Google parent took a hard fall in 2022. Both of its dual-class stock types fell by as much as 42% as the company was hamstrung by a rickety global economy and a weak digital advertising market. Overall, Alphabet's stock has gone essentially nowhere over the past two years, posting a loss of 3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, its formerly stalled growth is back in action now. Alphabet's trailing-12-month sales stand at $297 billion today, up from $258 billion in fiscal year 2021. That's 15% higher, in case you prefer to think in percentages. Free cash flow rose from $67 billion to $78 billion over the same period, a 16% increase.\n\nAbove all, Alphabet's future looks bright. The advertising market is coming back from its inflation-induced slump. Google Cloud is a leading provider of cloud-based access to powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and the company even designs its own AI accelerator microchips.\n\nSo Alphabet's stock chart has stalled while the business rekindled its fading growth. These days, Alphabet shares can be had at the modest valuations of 27 times trailing earnings and 23 times free cash flows. These readings stand below their long-term averages, and you know Alphabet will stay relevant in the long run. Ergo, this looks like a great time to scoop up some Alphabet shares on the cheap.\n\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 2: Netflix\n\nIf Alphabet took a bruising in 2022, the market took Netflix behind the woodshed for a proper pummeling. The streaming video pioneer's stock dropped by as much as 72% last year, and despite a strong rebound, Netflix still trades 19% below where it ended 2021. After a brief period when its investment theme was horror story, the company looks more like a wholesome family-friendly feature again, and well worth binge-investing in.\n\nThe thing is, the big drop it took in 2022 never made sense to me. Investors essentially punished Netflix for doing exactly what they had been hoping it would do -- putting a fresh focus on margins and profitable revenue growth. Management's enhanced desire for profitability came at the cost of slower customer growth, which used to be the most essential figure to watch in each of Netflix's quarterly reports. Old habits die hard, and the market's reaction to Netflix's updated strategy was brutal.\n\nNow, Netflix's stock price has approximately tripled from the multiyear low it touched in mid-2021. The most glaringly obvious opportunity to take advantage of the buying window is behind us. Still, Netflix strikes me as a solid buy with reignited growth engines and modest valuation ratios. In particular, Netflix stock is cheaper than ever on a price-to-free-cash-flow basis, which is the exact financial metric the company's critics used to complain about the most.\n\nCash flows may dip somewhat in 2024 as Netflix's content production projects get back on track after the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023, but the long-term trend is clear. Netflix is no longer seeking customers at any cost. Instead, the company is optimizing its cash flows and profits, even at the cost of slower subscriber growth. I'm perfectly fine with that switch, and Wall Street as a whole should eventually embrace it as well.\n\nUntil then, Netflix remains a no-brainer buy in my book.\n\nThe FAANG stock to avoid in 2024: Meta Platforms\n\nI'm not here to throw Meta Platform under the bus, but the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp just doesn't look like a buy right now.\n\nThe company's all-in bet on the metaverse is years away from paying metaphorical dividends. The Reality Labs division's revenues amount to a rounding error in Meta's overall financial structure, clocking in at 0.6% of total sales in the recent third-quarter report. But management is leaning into that potential growth driver with all its might. Those $210 million in third-quarter revenues came at the cost of an operating loss of $3.7 billion for the Reality Labs division.\n\nBut the company exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of this year's four earnings reports and investors see Mark Zuckerberg's business as a promising AI innovator. So the stock has gained 198% in 2023, largely erasing 2022's price drop.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Anders,\" I hear you say. \"Isn't this the same story as Alphabet, which experienced similar share price trends and advertising quirks over the last two years? If you like Alphabet, you should love Meta Platforms too.\"\n\nWell, I see the similarities, but Meta's situation is dramatically different from Alphabet's. The company formerly known as Facebook may have some AI ideas in its holster, but it can't match Google's decades of AI expertise or the AI-infused heft of the Google Cloud service. And if AI is supposed to save Meta from its low-growth morass, the heavy spending on metaverse projects must be viewed as an expensive distraction.\n\nIn sum, Meta Platforms seems like a momentum-powered stock right now, and I'm not convinced that AI will be a game-changer for the company. If and when the broader market reaches the same conclusion, Meta's stock could experience a painful price correction. Until then, I'd rather keep my hands off this overheated social media stock, even if it is part of the market-beating FAANG group.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

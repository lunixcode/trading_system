        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at Light Street Capital returned 46% in 2023: top 15 picks. If you wish to skip our detailed overview of Kacher’s history, investment philosophy and hedge fund performance, go directly to Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.\n\nGlen Kacher is the founder and chief investment officer at the hedge fund Light Street Capital. He attended University of Virginia where he graduated with B.S. Commerce at the McIntire School of Commerce. He obtained his MBA from Stanford University.\n\nKacher is among the famous figures in the hedge fund industry. The hedge fund boss, who chose to base his operations in Silicon Valley rather than Wall Street, learned investing from some of the industry’s greatest.\n\nPrior to starting Light Street Capital in 2010, Kacher worked as managing director at the hedge fund Integral Capital Partners under industry titan Roger McNamee. During his time at Integral, which started in 1998, Kacher oversaw investments in the technology sector. His investment areas of focus included software, internet services and media.\n\nBefore he joined Integral, Kacher worked for the hedge fund Tiger Management under Julian Robertson – a pioneering figure in the hedge fund industry. Kacher went to work for the billionaire legendary hedge fund manager Robertson’s fund after he graduated college with a bachelor’s degree in commerce in 1993 and remained there until 1997.\n\nAt Tiger, Kacher initially worked as a full-time research analyst. At some point, Kacher transitioned to the role of a part-time investment consultant for the hedge fund. During his tenure at Tiger, he focused on investments in hardware, software and networking industries\n\nKacher came to launch Light Street Capital armed with a graduate business degree, years of experience in investing in the technology space and lessons from some of the industry’s best. Kacher’s Light Street Capital is one of the Tiger cubs – hedge funds whose founders had worked at Tiger Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nLight Street Capital is a tech-focused hedge fund headquartered in Silicon Valley – the global epicenter of technology innovation. The firm has $680 million in assets under management. Light Street invests by applying long and short investment strategies.\n\nBeing based in Silicon Valley, Kacher has had a vantage view of the technology space, allowing him to better understand industry trends and spot opportunities ahead of others. In Silicon Valley, the Light Street Capital founder rubs shoulders with technology innovators, startup founders, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.\n\n\"What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry… It seemed crazy to go back to New York.\" Kacher once told Forbes.\n\nThe Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher’s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.\n\nAlso, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.\n\nAs with all other hedge funds, Kacher’s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2017, Light Street’s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.\n\nBut 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia’s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital. Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 15 Picks\n\nGlen Kacher of Light Street Capital\n\nBut the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.\n\nThe AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.\n\nWhile there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.\n\nKacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.\n\nAs to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.\n\nSoftware companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.\n\nAI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology’s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.\n\nApart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.\n\nAmid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.\n\nIn its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.\n\nWith these details in mind, let’s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nLight Street Capital bounced back in 2023 after the rout of technology companies in 2022 wiped out some 70% of the firm’s assets. The hedge fund benefited from its long positions in some extensive tech stocks that exploded amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Consequently, we have analyzed the hedge fund 13F filings and settled on its top stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on Glen Kacher’s hedge fund’s holdings. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nLight Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top Picks\n\n15. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.27 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 122\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of the stocks behind Light Street Capital returning 46% in 2023. The enterprise software giant is best known for its customer relationship management technology that brings customers and companies together. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)'s service includes sales to store data, monitor leads and progress, forecast opportunities,\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) surged by about 98% in 2023 as benefited from artificial intelligence playing a pivotal role in business operations across multiple industries. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)'s data cloud suite powered by AI continues to gain traction, with companies preparing for the eventual adoption of the technology.\n\nLight Street Capital reduced its holdings in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) by 44% to $11.27 million. According to data from Insider Monkey's database, a total of 122 elite hedge funds held positions in Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stock in the third quarter of 2023. Paul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, and Will Wurm’s Beech Hill Partners was one of the significant shareholder of the company in the fourth quarter of 2023, with shares worth $3.31 million.\n\nHere is what Polen Capital said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\n14. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.49 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 57\n\nSynopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a chip design software maker that provides electronic design automation software products to design and test integrated circuits. Synopsys, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) was the latest addition in Light Street Capital’s portfolio following the acquisition of $11.49 million worth of stakes in Q3 2023.\n\nAccording to data from Insider Monkey's database, a total of 57 elite hedge funds held positions in Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) stock in the third quarter of 2023. Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the prominent shareholder of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) with 36,714 shares worth $18.90 million.\n\nHere is what TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, said about Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Across the Information Technology universe, we seek companies possessing differentiated capabilities, products, and services. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS), a supplier of electronic design automation software for use in designing and testing integrated circuits, edged forward 5%. The company reported a solid fiscal fourth quarter and raised forward guidance. Despite macroeconomic concerns, their customers remain focused on developing next generation semiconductors with their electric design automation tools. We trimmed the position as it approached our price target.”\n\n13. Nerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.93 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 22\n\nNerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY) is a technology company that operates a platform that allows people to learn online. Nerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY)’s purpose-built proprietary platform leverages technology, including AI to connect students, users, parents, guardians, and purchasers of various ages to tutors, instructors, subject matter experts, educators, and other professionals.\n\nNerdy, Inc.

However, the hedge fund trimmed its exposure in the stock by 6% to $11.93 million in Q3 2023.\n\nAccording to the data from Insider Monkey, the number of hedge funds that owned shares of Nerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY) decreased from 25 in the second quarter of 2023 to 22 in the third quarter of 2023, which means that three hedge funds sold their stakes in the company during that period.\n\n12. indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $11.95 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 25\n\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) is a technology company that provides automotive semiconductors and software solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and electrification applications.\n\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI) is benefiting as the digitization of cars rapidly increases thanks to strong demand for electric vehicles and in-cabin infotainment. Indie Semiconductor outperformed the S&P 500 on rallying 34% in 2023 helping propel Light Street Capital to a gain of 46%. Light Street Capital reduced its holdings in indie Semiconductor, Inc.

Here is what it said:\n\n“Indie Semiconductor, Inc. is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for advanced driver assistance systems and connected-car user experience and electrification applications. Shares fell during the quarter due to investor concerns that near-term automotive semiconductor demand will face headwinds because of excess inventory in the automotive semiconductor supply chain, combined with third quarter revenue guidance that slightly missed consensus expectations due to a customer slightly delaying the launch of a new vehicle model where indie had secured a design win (so delayed, not lost sales). As indie steadily ramps new product and design wins into production, we are confident the company will achieve its targeted model of profitability by year end, while effectively doubling revenues as it delivers on its $4.3 billion and growing strategic backlog. We believe indie has the potential to grow from its $200 million revenue run rate today to its targeted $500 million by 2025 and $1 billion by 2028. In the years ahead, indie should benefit as it develops differentiated, highly integrated, energy-efficient products, while the automotive semiconductor vertical remains highly attractive over the long term.”\n\n11. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.17 Million Number of Hedge fund Holders: 286\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a multinational technology company with diverse business interests. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates an e-commerce platform that connects merchants and consumers worldwide.\n\nAs Light Street Capital returned 46% in 2023, Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 278 in the previous quarter. Notably, Paul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, and Will Wurm’s Beech Hill Partners emerged as one of the significant stakeholder in the company, with 52,700 shares valued at $8 million.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”\n\n10. Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.74 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 23\n\nCellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) is a software infrastructure company that develops solutions for legally sanctioned investigations. Its DI suite of solutions allows users to collect, review, analyze, and manage digital data across the investigative lifecycle concerning legally sanctioned investigations.\n\nCellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) was one of the best-performing stocks in the Light Street Capital portfolio as it rallied by 95% in 2023, outperforming the 24% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nThe hedge fund benefited from the rally, having first bought a stake in Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in Q3 2021 and ended up with stakes worth $15.74 million as of Q3 2023.\n\nFor their Q3 2023 shareholdings, 23 of the 910 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey held a stake in Cellebrite DI Ltd (NASDAQ: CLBT). Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was a remarkable shareholder of Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) with stakes worth $2.26 million.\n\nHere is what Greenhaven Road Capital said about Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)– Cellebrite provides tools to law enforcement to extract data (evidence) from cell phones, analyze the data, and manage the data. Solving many crimes without their tools is inconceivable. They are mission critical. One of the best indicators of business quality is pricing power. The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company’s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their “Premium” offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, “premium” but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading “arms dealer” to collect and review data from mobile phones.\n\nOver the course of the quarter, Cellebrite hired an Executive Chairman from the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners. It will be interesting to see if he can apply any of the “Vista playbook” to Cellebrite operations, and if he can help put some of the $230M+ in cash that Cellebrite has on its books to work via acquisitions. At just over 3x 2024 revenue and profitable, Cellebrite is priced at a significant discount to peers, as if growth will evaporate. I suspect that, over time, growth occurs and multiple expands, or a firm like Vista Equity Partners acquires them.”\n\n9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.79 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 81\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a pioneer electric vehicle company that designs, develops, manufactures and sells zero emission motor vehicles, energy generation and storage systems. . Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s automotive segment is known for electric cars, while the energy generation and storage segment designs, manufactures, and sells solar energy generation and energy storage products.\n\nWhile Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was under pressure late last year, it still finished the year up 123%, helping Light Street Capital return 43%. Nevertheless, the hedge fund trimmed its stakes in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) by 42% in Q3 2023 to $15.79 million.\n\nFor their September quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 81 out of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors. Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the significant shareholder of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) with stakes worth $944.85 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nTsai Capital Corporation, an investment management firm, mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”\n\n8. JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG)\n\nLight Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.85 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 30\n\nBased in Sunnyvale, California, JFrog Ltd.

(NASDAQ:FROG), up from 27 in the previous quarter.\n\nHere is what Madison Investments said about JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the third quarter, we added two investments to the portfolio (FROG and HAYW). Software provider JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG) sells software tools to the Dev/Sec/Ops space (Development, Security and Operations). Their software forms a critical component of the software development chain. Essentially, large enterprises use FROG’s tools to develop, secure and operate their software infrastructure. We believe J Frog is a very strategic asset that dominates its niche. The company is profitable, with recurring revenues that drive material cash flow, buttressed with a strong balance sheet.”\n\n7. Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (8.52% weight in the Fund): Google’s earnings report in October showed its core advertising business accelerating to double digit growth as the digital advertising recession of 2022 and early 2023 fades away. However, the company’s Cloud division, which is expected to generate growth from selling access to artificial intelligence services, saw its growth rate slow modestly. Juxtaposed with Microsoft’s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google’s stock on the report. While the stock recovered to new highs by the end of the year, the earnings report set back caused the stock to trail behind the S&P 500 with a gain of 6.8% for the quarter.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Best Countries for English Speakers to Work 35 Richest Countries by Median Income 20 Safest Countries for US Travelers in the World\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks Set for a Post-Earnings Take Off",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been hot property over the past few months. With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence and the massive demand for data centers, several companies are making the most of this phase and reporting impressive revenue numbers. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already an industry leader, and it can become difficult to match its rally, other tech stocks are slowly but steadily expanding their market share and could report impressive numbers in the coming weeks. The earnings season is an ideal time to invest in stocks that show high growth potential. Here are the three tech stocks post-earnings ready for take-off. Grab them before they are gone!\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest competitor of Nvidia this year could be the year of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company has faced several challenges in the past but its recent fourth-quarter results are impressive. It beat analyst expectations, and the revenue saw a 10% year-over-year increase to $6.2 billion. The net income hit $667 million, which is a significant rise from $21 million in the same quarter the prior year.\n\nThis is an impressive feat, and there is no stopping AMD. Higher revenue and improved profits are driven by the improvement in the data center segment and the company’s ability to focus on the core business areas. The data center saw a 38% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter, and I believe the company is only getting started. This is a sign that the company’s new products have got a positive response and it could enjoy a robust performance in the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock has the potential to double in the coming months. It might not be able to enjoy a rally like Nvidia, but it can generate significant gains. AMD has already positioned itself as one of the best alternatives for Nvidia chips with the new chip launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral tech giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), have shown interest in using AMD chips. It also enjoys a price advantage over Nvidia’s chips. AMD has a diverse range of products that meet the needs of every consumer. Improved revenue stream and higher adoption of the chips will help AMD soar to new highs this year. Buy the stock before it skyrockets.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a tech giant, and the company has been a winner in the AI space. It already has an established market and is known for its database software which is growing due to generative AI offerings. The company has seen strong demand for its cloud services and saw a significant 52% revenue jump in the cloud infrastructure for the third quarter which came in at $1.6 billion. One big reason to invest in Oracle stock is its partnership with Microsoft Azure, where it is ramping up the data centers and building new ones.\n\nThe future of Oracle is cloud, and this is where it will achieve success. I am expecting record quarterly revenue from the company, and the stock could take off after the earnings. ORCL stock is up by 8% year to date. Once the company reports results, we could see the stock soar. It also boasts a modest dividend yield of 1.40%.\n\nI consider Oracle to be a safe haven stock and have recommended it in the past as well. Since most of its success comes from cloud infrastructure services, it is here to stay and has become highly reliable in terms of revenue growth. The company is aggressively building data centers, and as it scales up the cloud segment, we could see an improvement in the operating margin.\n\nAfter the quarterly results, the management mentioned that the demand for its data centers was “astronomical” and this is something to be excited about. Oracle is now stronger than ever, and this is the time for cloud computing businesses. You will regret not buying this stock.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best tech stocks to add to your portfolio, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is known as a global e-commerce giant, but it is so much more than that. It has become more of a tech company today and is using AI to leverage sales.\n\nWhile Amazon needs no introduction, its subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services company in the world with a massive market. The company might have announced results while you read this, and I am certain that the positive numbers will take the stock on an upward momentum. I believe Amazon will report an exceptional quarter driven by Prime Day, holiday shopping, and a rise in advertising revenue.\n\n2024 could be a stellar year for the company as it shows positive signs of growth with rising demand for AWS. In the third quarter results, AWS revenue increased 12% year over year to hit $23.1 billion, and with the generative AI offerings, we should expect the same level of growth to continue in 2024. The total operating income in the quarter was $11.2 billion out of which $7 billion was from AWS. I am highly optimistic about the future of Amazon and believe it will soar this year.\n\nThe stock is up by 52% in the year and is close to the 52-week high of $161. The stock hasn’t moved much over the past month but could take off post-earnings. This is one blue-chip stock to buy and hold forever.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Today’s dividend stocks are increasingly popular in a wild reversal as top tech stocks take center stage and push market indices back to all-time highs. But that presents a prime opportunity for income investors and long-term “buy and hold” strategists. Many top earners and long-term compounders are priced to buy at a bargain today.\n\nIf you’re cautious, you may also be nervous about the increasing market concentration in just a handful of stocks. That’s a reasonable fear, and just like dividend stocks benefit income investors, they’re also an ideal asset to cycle into if you (like many) think we’re on the cusp of an imminent correction.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) often tops lists of dividend stocks to own forever, and it’s clear why. The company’s dividend aristocrat status, monthly distributions and 5.66% yield make it a perennial favorite. And, after falling nearly 20% over the past year, this dividend stock is priced to buy if you’re in it for the long haul. Nothing has materially changed about O’s inherent stock strength, making the company a compounder for buyers today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRealty Income boasts more than 98% occupancy across its properties, with 80% of retail tenants belonging to sectors resilient to economic downturns. Most notably, a significant portion of these tenants are in the grocery sector, with convenience stores, dollar stores and drugstores also making up a substantial part of its portfolio, creating a robust mix immune to all but the most devastating downside.\n\nThe company’s triple-net lease model also transfers all operational risks and expenses, including property maintenance costs, to the tenants. This structure effectively protects Realty Income from the rising material and labor costs often accompanying higher interest rates. Moreover, with leases typically lasting 15 years or more, complete with renewal options, Realty Income enjoys a steady stream of rental income. The average lease term until renewal is just below 10 years today, giving the REIT considerable flexibility over the next decade, no matter what the economy does (or doesn’t) do in the interim.\n\nStory continues\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T logo on wooden background\n\nSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) positions itself as a leading growth-oriented dividend stock, pushing the boundaries of a globally connected future while offering a healthy 6.48% total yield. The company is pivotal in fundingAST SpaceMobile’s (NASDAQ:ASTS) satellite-based cell service project, slated for commercial release in 2024, marking a significant boost for AT&T’s growth prospects in 2024 and proving that dividend stocks aren’t just “boring but reliable.”\n\nIn its recent earnings report, AT&T highlighted its growth trajectory despite earnings falling short of expectations. But, considering the upside, disappointing earnings create a perfect buying opportunity. The report revealed a nearly 4% year-over-year increase in wireless service revenue, showcasing AT&T’s ability to maintain a high subscriber base and implement necessary price adjustments amidst challenging economic conditions. This achievement is underscored by AT&T’s postpaid phone net additions, which exceeded expectations at 526,000 against the forecasted 487,500. Considering how competitive and saturated the telecom market is, this performance is awe-inspiring and bodes well for AT&T’s further growth if its ASTS investment bears fruit.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of mixing dividends with growth, few healthcare companies are better investments than this dividend aristocrat, yielding 3.37% today.\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) offers the perfect blend of stability and growth potential unmatched by any other. Healthcare is a perennial top pick for long-term investing, and Medtronic’s sector dominance and dividend status set it apart.\n\nMedtronic’s collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to craft an AI-driven diagnostic tool reinforces its unique position at the intersection of growth and stability. Likewise, Medtronic’s CEO Geoff Martha recently emphasized the company’s strategic use of AI to enhance clinical decisions, innovate new treatment indicators and personalize patient care, positioning Medtronic at the forefront of AI integration in medical technology.\n\nToday, Medtronic is gearing up for a late February earnings announcement. Given the impressive results of its previous report, investors should anticipate another strong showing for the dividend stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Blockchain technology stands out as a highly influential and disruptive force, though some may overlook its investment potential amid newer, exciting tech trends. Nevertheless, discerning investors are eyeing select blockchain stocks to buy, anticipating a rekindling of market enthusiasm. Blockchain technology, often overshadowed by the crypto frenzy, is gaining momentum. The blockchain market was worth $4.8 billion in 2022, but projections suggest it will surge to $674 billion by 2030 and reach a staggering $2.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nBlockchain’s allure lies in its versatility, spanning diverse industries and offering cost-efficiency, enhanced security and innovation. Experts estimate it could boost the global GDP by over $2 trillion by 2030. The resurgence of blockchain stocks, particularly those connected to crypto-centric firms, is exemplified by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC), with a remarkable 211% year-over-year surge to $38.87 per share.\n\nConsequently, this underscores blockchain’s potential in reshaping finance. As Bitcoin regains traction, keep an eye on these three blockchain stocks set to soar this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRiot Blockchain (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) is a leading player in the cryptocurrency mining sector, primarily focusing on Bitcoin mining. Over the past year, RIOT’s stock has seen remarkable growth, surging by 90%. Moreover, Wall Street analysts assign a further potential upside of 65% and a ‘strong buy’ rating.\n\nThis bullish sentiment is underpinned by RIOT’s improving financial performance. Projections indicate a significant 49.8% bump in revenue expected per annum. Moreover, optimism surrounds the potential for a substantial increase in RIOT’s book value per share, especially in anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in April.\n\nCurrently, Riot Blockchain holds a substantial portfolio of 7,362 Bitcoins. Historical data indicates that Bitcoin often experiences rallies before and after halving events, potentially leading to a more robust balance sheet for RIOT. This has prompted some investors to consider the stock undervalued, solidifying Riot Blockchain’s position as a promising blockchain stock with notable growth potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlock (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) presents a compelling opportunity among undervalued blockchain stocks. Boasting a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35.72, the company holds strong appeal for investors. In its recent third quarter, Block demonstrated its financial prowess, with a noteworthy 15% year-over-year increase in gross profit. Moreover, it outperformed expectations with a revenue of $5.62 billion, marking a stellar 24.3% year-over-year growth, exceeding estimates by $190 million.\n\nThe transformation of Square into Block in 2021 reflects the company’s steadfast commitment to Bitcoin and blockchain technology. In June 2022, Block unveiled its ambitious plan for Web5, a pioneering Bitcoin blockchain platform for decentralized identity and data storage in applications. Recently, Block launched a Web5 toolkit, streamlining decentralized app development, signaling a promising future.\n\nMoreover, Block unveiled a self-custody Bitcoin wallet in December 2023, reinforcing its dedication to Bitcoin security. These strategic initiatives, combined with Block’s early-mover advantage, position it favorably for growth and innovation in the blockchain industry.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept.

However, it may be prudent for investors to exercise caution and await a correction before considering fresh exposure. The stock’s soaring performance is undeniably linked to the promising growth prospects within the AI market.\n\nAdditionally, it’s worth noting that NVDA’s GPUs are pivotal in cryptocurrency mining, a critical component of blockchain networks like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD). Moreover, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to expand, with new digital currencies that support GPU mining emerging daily. This trend is poised to accelerate as cryptocurrency awareness spreads and accessibility grows, further bolstering NVDA’s position in the industry.\n\nFurthermore, analysts anticipate a robust 29.3% yearly increase in earnings per share. This sustained growth will continue in the low double digits until 2028. Consequently, this forecast underscores NVDA’s resilience and its potential for sustained success in the years ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "Wednesday, January 31, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and General Electric Company (GE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +22.7%) on the back of the company’s strong leverage artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Caterpillar have modestly outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry over the past year (+24.6% vs. +23.7%). The company’s revenues and earnings have grown year over year for eleven straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions, which offset the impact of the supply-chain snarls and cost pressures.\r\n\r\nThe Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world. Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment.\r\n\r\nThe Energy & Transportation segment remains well-poised for growth, backed by strong demand across all applications. Its dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives will help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Caterpillar here >>>)\r\n\r\nGeneral Electric shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+63.2% vs. +3.8%). The company is witnessing strength in its Aerospace segment, driven by robust demand and solid execution in commercial engines and services.\r\n\r\nWith strength in GE Gas Power services and growth in Grid business and Onshore Wind in North America, signs of improvement in GE Vernova (the combined operations of GE Power and Renewable) hold promise. Driven by solid momentum across its businesses, the company raised its 2023 guidance.\r\n\r\nAcquisitions made over time are also likely to be beneficial. Its policy of rewarding shareholders handsomely works in its favor. The firm's improved liquidity position also adds to its strength. However, supply chain disruptions in the defense market continue to take a toll on the company’s operations.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on General Electric here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Union Pacific Corporation (UNP), Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) and Schlumberger Limited (SLB)\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Lockheed Martin is collaborating with Nvidia to build a prototype that uses AI to combine data and detect anomalies in current environmental conditions. The tool could be increasingly important as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last year reported record ocean surface temperatures\n\nThe company’s have been working together since 2022 to build a prototype of an AI-driven Earth and Space Observing Digital Twin that can process live streams of weather data, apply AI to analyze the data and display current global environmental conditions from satellite and ground-based observations and output from weather forecasting models.\n\nThe project recently reached a significant milestone, demonstrating sea surface temperatures, one of NOAA’s critical data pipelines, to highlight multi-sensor fusion from satellite and model data along with short term temperature anomalies.\n\nMost Read from IEN:\n\nPodcast: Toyota Company Won't Reopen Factories; Space Station Blows Up; Ford Cuts Lightning Production Kubota Hit With Record ‘Made in USA’ Penalty First Human Receives Neuralink Implant BMW to Add Humanoid Bots to Auto Production\n\nThe Earth and Space Observing Digital Twin hopes to provide NOAA with a centralized approach to fuse and visualize data from various space and earth sensors. The demo showed NOAA and other government customers the potential of using AI to display high-resolution, accurate, and timely depictions of satellites and sensor data.\n\nThe NOAA is sent terabytes of weather data from multiple space and Earth-based sensors daily, accurately fusing the information could support real-time representations of global conditions.\n\nAccording to Lynn Montgomery, AI research engineer at Lockheed Martin, the platform could be a “one-stop-shop for global weather monitoring” and enable more accurate initial conditions for predictive forecasting.\n\nThe project uses Lockheed Martin’s OpenRosetta3D software and the NVIDIA Omniverse development platform to build applications that aggregate data in real time. The digital twin uses these technologies to advance 4D visualizations and display this information in a digestible format.\n\nNext, Lockheed will feed additional data streams, like space weather and sea ice concentrations, into the Earth and Space Observing Digital Twin next year.\n\nThis project was funded by NOAA SAE Joint Venture Partnerships for the exploration of possibilities for a future state and not a mission itself.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer is Bullish on These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nThese days, Jim Cramer is continuously talking about the broader market rotation out of AI and mega-cap tech towards stocks with lower valuation multiples. In his latest program, Cramer said that stocks from bank, steel and auto sectors are getting a lot of attention from the Wall Street. Cramer said in this environment he would buy stocks like General Motors that is trading four times earnings. Cramer said \"to raise the money\" to invest in undervalued stocks like GM, \"I will sell shares that trade 40 times earnings.\"\n\n\"Charnel House\" of Tech Stocks?\n\nCramer said that the money going into undervalued stocks cannot be \"enticed\" into \"what looks like a charnel house\" of tech stocks. Cramer also mentioned Wells Fargo and said investors in this environment would prefer to buy Wells Fargo which trades at lower multiples and also offers dividends instead of buying software stocks with higher earnings multiples or no earnings at all.\n\nJim Cramer also said that looking at some technical charts shows him that tech stocks are headed for major \"reversals.\"\n\nJim Cramer advised investors to practice patience in this environment and said it would be wise to process all the information as it comes before making any decisions.\n\nDespite constantly talking about this market rotation, Cramer also talks about how he's not worried about the lack of market breadth and concentration of market returns in tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). He recently said that his Charitable Trust owns the \"super six\" stocks (all Mag. 7 stocks minus Tesla) and there's a reason why all market gains were coming from tech stocks. Cramer said major tech companies make products and services for the Enterprise which has \"a lot of money\" to spend.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer is Bullish on These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 stocks Cramer is bullish on and recommended investors to buy. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nIn a latest program Jim Cramer was asked about Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) as the questioner said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is everywhere because of its digital images. Cramer initially appeared reluctant as he said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) went public via SPAC and if it hadn’t been a SPAC he'd be more excited about the stock. But Cramer at the end said Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is a Buy.\n\n\"At five bucks I would actually own that stock. It is all over the place.\"\n\nGetty Images talked about how it's using generative AI in its business during its Q3 earnings call:\n\n\"In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images’ best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people.\n\nIt also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively. We are rewarding our contributors with an ongoing share of each and every dollar we earn from the service.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. John Bean Technologies Corp (NYSE:JBT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nFood tech company John Bean Technologies Corp (NYSE:JBT) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer likes. Recently, Cramer said that he is \"actually quite fond of this company.\"\n\n\"It's a little quirky but it's good,\" Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that global industrial food is one of his favorite sectors to invest in.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in John Bean Technologies Corp (NYSE:JBT).\n\nLike John Bean Technologies, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are also among the favorite stock picks of Jim Cramer.\n\n8. Timken Co (NYSE:TKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nBearings and power transmission company Timken Co (NYSE:TKR) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is bullish on these days. Earlier this month, Jim Cramer said that Timken Co (NYSE:TKR) shares are \"so cheap down here.\" Cramer also said he thinks the stock is \"real good.\"\n\nEarlier this month D.A. Davidson gave a Buy rating to Timken Co (NYSE:TKR). DA Davidson's analyst Michael Shlisky said in his note that Timken Co (NYSE:TKR) is one of the “best of breed” stocks. The analyst set a $92 price target on the stock.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 25 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Timken Co (NYSE:TKR). The most significant stakeholder of Timken Co (NYSE:TKR) during this period was Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management which owns a $56 million stake in Timken Co (NYSE:TKR).\n\n7.

PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) stock recently touched new highs after posting strong fourth-quarter results.\n\nJim Cramer after the results said PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) is a ‘true innovator’.\n\nThe company in its latest earnings call talked about its guidance:\n\n\"In 2024, the European economy is forecast to grow modestly. We expect the above 16-tonne truck registrations to be in the range of 260,000 to 300,000. Last year, the South American above 16-tonne truck market was 110,000 vehicles and is expected to be similar this year. In Brazil, DAF achieved a record 10.2% share, up from 6.9% last year. DAF Brazil makes a growing contribution to PACCAR’s global success. PACCAR full year truck parts and other gross margins were 19.3% and were 19.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong truck deliveries and excellent parts business. We estimate PACCAR’s worldwide first quarter truck and parts gross margins to remain strong and be in the range of 18.5% to 19%. 2023 was another great year for PACCAR with many highlights, including revenue and net income records.\n\nPACCAR announced a joint venture to manufacture commercial vehicle batteries. DAF opened a new electric truck assembly plant and earned the Green Truck award as the most fuel-efficient truck in Europe.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG). An energetic Cramer said \"we like those guys so much.\" Cramer added that Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) offers \"all the kind of energy I like\" under one roof.\n\nConstellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) shares have gained about 46% over the past one year.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG).\n\nIn addition to Constellation Energy, Jim Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nSound Shore Management made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On the plus side of the ledger, we had strong contributions from independent power producers Vistra and Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG). Both stocks surged with higher US electricity prices as strong summer demand exposed reliability issues in many regions of the nation’s electric grid. Meanwhile, Midwest focused Constellation is the biggest producer of carbon-free electricity in the US with nuclear power plants representing the majority of its capacity. We added the name in January 2023 when the stock was trading at a below normal 15 times earnings. Our research identified an upside to earnings power from maturing hedges and regulatory changes, including the Inflation Reduction Act’s nuclear credit. A recent spinout from Exelon Corp, we viewed the strength of Constellation’s clean, reliable baseload power model as an appealing and high potential offering for residential and commercial customers. The company’s recent contract to supply Microsoft at premium power prices is evidence of the opportunity. Constellation is yet another example of an industry undergoing tremendous change that can offer attractive investment opportunities for investors with patience and a research process to uncover specific companies that are well positioned.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 12 Recent Additions Jim Cramer Says Recession Is Not Coming and Recommends These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Why Microsoft, Google, and AMD's stocks are getting hit after big quarters",
        "content": "When you are a stock priced for greatness but only deliver a super good earnings report...sometimes investors will get in a huff.\n\nSuch is the case with the initial crop of earnings from tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). The three stocks (with a combined market cap of $5.2 trillion) were instrumental in powering the broader market to records over the past year, but are getting dinged after reporting earnings late Tuesday.\n\nThe moves are \"signaling some overextension of the recent strong rally,\" said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance.\n\nAt first glance, the negative moves in the stock prices would seem counterintuitive to the average investor who have ridden these tech giants to massive paper gains.\n\nBut here is the deal, as President Biden would put it.\n\nThat average investor probably read the earnings releases of these bellwether companies last night. I’ll say a good percentage of them listened to the earnings calls (which you should be doing!).\n\nBy 7:00pm last night, with a full page of notes, many investors still can’t figure out why these stocks are being swept into downdrafts.\n\nAll three companies showed impressive growth numbers (especially AMD, with data center sales up 38% year over year and a 75% hike to 2024 AI chip sales estimates), hyped the AI train again (a surefire ticket for stock gains last year), and didn’t sound serious alarm bells on the economy.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nThe reality is that none of these quarters were perfect, versus investor expectations of perfection. And believe me, investors have priced in perfection to these stocks: according to Yahoo Finance data, these three stocks trade on an average forward P/E multiple of 35 times. The S&P 500 trades at 22 times, for perspective.\n\nThe vibe coming off these earnings, according to sources, is that growth is good because of the expansion of new AI tools and other businesses, but not mind-blowingly good.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s results unearthed some caution on the economy, pros say.\n\n\"While Microsoft’s F2Q24 top-line results for the two most important businesses (Azure and Office 365 Commercial) were in line to a little better than consensus expectations (and guidance), they were a bit below what our Plausible scenario anticipated, indicating slightly moderating business momentum,\" Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci wrote in a note to clients. FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is seen on the Google house at CES 2024, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 10, 2024. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nGoogle missed estimates for its ad revenue (from Search and Youtube), and its cloud business didn't light it up versus larger rival in Microsoft's Azure.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill noted on Alphabet: \"Strong ad demand drove accelerating, double-digit growth in Search and YouTube, though shy of some investor bogeys. Cloud growth re-accelerated, but remains below Azure.\"\n\nAs for AMD, its gaming chip sales fell 17% from the year prior, and guidance didn't wow the investing masses.\n\n\"This knee-jerk reaction [to tech results] is noise, the AI revolution has started,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me via email.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nBut all in, Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and other members of the Magnificent 7 will have to do better than Microsoft, AMD, and Alphabet to impress investors demanding excellence paired with a side of perfection.\n\nIf they don't, 2024 may go down as the year of the Unmagnificent 7.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Nvidia a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company’s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company’s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company’s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.\r\n\r\nSanta Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023, slightly up from $26.91 billion in fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\nBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments – Graphics and Compute & Networking.\r\n\r\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\r\n\r\nCompute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 44% and 56% of fiscal 2023 revenues, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Nvidia a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in January 2014 would be worth $159,730.28, or a gain of 15,873.03%, as of January 31, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 174.50% and gold's return of 57.04% over the same time frame.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for NVDA too.\n\nNVIDIA's Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 30.32%, and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "The Best AI Investment Right Now Is Obvious (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Although many point to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as the best artificial intelligence (AI) investment right now, I'm staying away from it. Because Nvidia is a hardware company, this strength will eventually fade, and investors will be stuck holding a stock valued for a business it no longer has.\n\nInstead, a far better alternative to Nvidia is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google. I've got four reasons why Alphabet will be a much better long-term investment today than Nvidia, and why its business is more sustainable.\n\n1. Alphabet's products are subscription-based\n\nAs mentioned above, Nvidia is a hardware company. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the best in class for AI model training. However, once it sells the GPU, that's it. Unless clients come back to build additional supercomputers or upgrade their system down the line, Nvidia's sales are a one-time benefit.\n\nAlphabet is a massive Nvidia GPU buyer, but it has set up a subscription model using these products. One of Alphabet's most exciting segments is Google Cloud, its cloud computing division. By filling data centers with powerful Nvidia GPUs, clients who need access to extreme computing power can rent it from Alphabet. This allows these clients to stay asset-light and quickly scale up or down according to their needs. Because the revenue stream from this business is recurring, it's far more sustainable.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet has other AI products, like its generative AI model Gemini. This model beats the competition in multiple tests and will create a new revenue stream for Alphabet as it's implemented into various programs.\n\nWhile Nvidia's one-time sales may provide flashy year-over-year growth figures in boom times, they're not as sustainable as Alphabet's subscription-focused approach.\n\n2. Nvidia saw the first wave of AI benefits\n\nBecause Nvidia is a pick-and-shovel play, it saw the first wave of AI demand. With companies like Alphabet ordering thousands of GPUs to outfit their data centers, it experienced a sudden demand rush. It's not advisable to invest in a company in the middle of a demand rush, as many lofty expectations are already baked into the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Alphabet has seen increased demand for cloud computing and generative AI, it's in the early stages. This means the rush hasn't happened for Alphabet yet, making me more excited to get into Alphabet's stock before the big move comes along.\n\n3. Alphabet's stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's\n\nAnother issue with Nvidia's stock is how expensive it has gotten. With Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at a much higher level than Alphabet's valuation, it has a lot of expectations built in. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nAlphabet doesn't have nearly the same hype around its stock and trades at about the same level as the broader S&P 500, which has a forward P/E of 20.\n\nIf Alphabet maintains its status quo, it will still be a market-beating stock. If Nvidia misses expectations, the bottom will fall out of the stock.\n\n4. Alphabet is more balanced if AI fizzles out\n\nFinally, Alphabet is far more diversified than Nvidia. If this AI trend turns out to be a bust (I don't think it will be), then a large swath of Nvidia's business will evaporate. This wouldn't be the first time this has happened to Nvidia, as multiple crypto crashes have caused the company's revenue to drop rapidly when demand fell.\n\nAlthough many investors (including myself) are excited about Alphabet's AI prospects, at the end of the day, nearly 80% of its revenue comes from advertising services. Advertising has been around for thousands of years and likely won't fade away anytime soon.\n\nSo, regardless of how successful AI proliferation is, Alphabet should be fine.\n\nTo me, Alphabet is a much better investment right now than Nvidia. While Nvidia may see strength throughout the rest of 2024, it will likely eventually experience a drop in demand due to its non-subscription business model. If you like roller coasters, Nvidia may be a better stock, although you may never return to the highs you experience early on. But if you like a steady, market-beating ride, Alphabet is a far better pick.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Value investors follow Benjamin Graham’s investment philosophy and look for equities that offer a reasonable margin of safety. While this strategy can help value investors avoid high-growth stocks that crash, they also tend to miss out on stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nSome value investors accept this trade-off and look for less volatile assets. However, some value stocks offer a good combination of a low valuation and promising growth opportunities. Investors looking for growth at a reasonable price may want to consider these top picks.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) provides technology that enables semiconductor giants to produce more efficient chips. That puts the company in several high-growth industries like artificial intelligence, which can raise the stock price considerably.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShares have gained more than 500% over the past five years, but the rally has largely fizzled out since August 2023. The stock now trades at a 19 P/E ratio despite posting impressive growth rates in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nYear-over-year revenue and earnings growth came in at 27.6% and 63.7%, respectively. Those growth rates helped the company reach a 22.5% net profit margin during the quarter. The low 19 P/E ratio makes little sense since the company has a vast $1.2 billion backlog. The backlog is higher than the company’s target of $1.1 billion in revenue for 2023.\n\nAxcelis Technologies is likely undervalued since fewer investors know about it. Shares only have a $4 billion market cap and have been down by 25% over the past six months. Financial performance doesn’t give any justifiable reason for the dramatic drop.\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (DRCT) An abstract image of a stock chart with two arrows pointing upward representing value stocks. Deep Value Stocks to buy\n\nSource: Feylite / Shutterstock\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:DRCT) falls in the same category as Axcelis Technologies. Not enough investors know about this stock. DRCT has a $165 million market cap and a forward P/E ratio of 15.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares had previously remained roughly flat, with some ups and downs since its 2022 IPO. However, the storyline changed as DRCT stock shot up by over 300% since November. More investors gradually learning about the stock could have contributed to the gains.\n\nHowever, the company’s financials likely had a bigger impact. The programmatic advertising company generated 129% year-over-year revenue growth while more than quadrupling its net income in the third quarter of 2023. Full-year guidance implies revenue will more than double at the midpoint.\n\nDirect Digital Holdings has a growing buy-side advertising segment, but the real growth comes from its sell-side advertising division. The company’s Colossus sell-side platform (SSP) expanded its revenue by 174% year-over-year.\n\nSell-side advertising makes up over 86% of the company’s total revenue. Since the big revenue driver is also growing fastest, investors should expect revenue acceleration in the coming quarters.\n\nPayPal (PYPL)  Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone.

The fintech company hasn’t had the best of luck over the past few years. Shares are down by 31% over the past five years as a pandemic rally to over $300/share now feels like a distant memory.\n\nPayPal continues to grow on the top line but didn’t have the best performance for its bottom line in the third quarter of 2023. During that quarter, revenue increased by 8% year-over-year while earnings per share dropped by 19% year-over-year.\n\nCEO Alex Chriss is new to the job and has only held the helm since September 2023. He’ll want to make a big impression and PayPal’s upcoming AI-based products can do just that. Some analysts are skeptical.\n\nIt’s too early to gauge how PayPal stock will play out under its new CEO. However, the stock currently offers an 18 P/E ratio. The valuation is low for an iconic brand that has become a household name.\n\nThe reasonable valuation leaves room for some upside, but it will take a big change for investors to treat PayPal like a growth stock again.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ACLS and DRCT.

        "content": "Should you hold a stock forever? Some say that investors shouldn't marry their stocks. I'd argue in favor of holding stocks for as long as their underlying businesses perform, which could include forever.\n\nAdmittedly, that sets the bar high. Most companies have occasional bumps and bruises. The good ones bounce back. But business is competitive, and staying atop the mountain for decades is hard.\n\nKeeping that in mind, I set out to build a list of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that could potentially earn a permanent spot in a diversified portfolio. After all, AI is forecast to create trillions of dollars in economic value over the coming decades. That means it should be an excellent spot for long-term thinking.\n\nWhat makes a company (and its stock) likely to last for such a long time? Image source: Getty Images\n\nThe recipe for forever AI stocks\n\nNobody knows what the future will hold. AI could look completely different in a decade than it does now. Looking for future-resistant businesses steered me to look for a few crucial traits. Specifically, investors should take a closer look at companies with:\n\nDominant existing business models Great balance sheets Tremendous cash flows\n\nIn other words, look for situations where AI strengthens an already great company.\n\nWith that said, consider buying and keeping these three AI stocks forever:\n\n1. Nvidia: Dominating the AI chip market\n\nYou've probably seen a ton of coverage on Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and most investors already know about its potential. But Nvidia is too important to leave off this list just because it isn't the new thing. The company rapidly acquired a stranglehold on the AI chip market, and it is arguably the most essential building block of AI because the models that are essential to AI require lots of computing power to crunch data. According to analysts, Nvidia's AI chip market share sits around 90%.\n\nAs a result, business is booming. Top and bottom-line growth rocketed off in 2023, and since the AI chip market is poised to expand tremendously moving forward, this could be the new normal for a while.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhy should investors feel optimistic that Nvidia will keep its market share? The company built an end-to-end hardware and software ecosystem that helps customers using its chips deploy and maximize their AI models. The entire platform is the secret sauce, not just the chips themselves. Are companies building within this ecosystem going to bail and use something else easily? That would be like changing all the electrical wiring in your house. It's a messy job that's probably not appealing to most.\n\n2. A cloud giant distributing AI tools\n\nE-commerce giant and cloud leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for several businesses, so its AI potential might slip under the radar a bit. But that could work in investors' favor. Amazon has already built a trillion-dollar company on e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and streaming. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has blossomed into the world's leader with an estimated 50% market share, according to research by HG Insights.\n\nThat same report estimates roughly 2.38 million businesses use Amazon's cloud computing services, so that is low-hanging fruit to begin cross-selling AI products and services. Cloud computing is already projected to continue growing for years, and weaving AI and machine learning into that business may only pour gas on Amazon's success. AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAdditionally, Amazon's strong presence in e-commerce (38% market share in the U.S.) and rapidly growing advertising business are excellent safety nets for investors. AI can add to a winning business instead of putting Amazon in a make-or-break scenario. That sets a high floor, making Amazon an outstanding stock to buy and tuck away.\n\n3. Ambitious and bold leadership drives this stock\n\nCEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk seemingly likes doing hard stuff. He built a space exploration company and led Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) to disrupt the automotive industry with electric vehicles. Naturally, he wouldn't let the AI technology era arrive without tossing his hat in the ring. Tesla is investing heavily in multiple AI-related products.\n\nTesla's full-self-driving (FSD) ambitions headline this list. The company has been developing FSD software for years that relies on camera imagery to process the vehicle's surroundings. Musk himself has said that Tesla's value depends heavily on succeeding with FSD. Additionally, the company is developing a humanoid robot that will hopefully utilize FSD's tech to perform manual labor someday. Tesla's Dojo supercomputer powers its AI, making the EV company a full-fledged technology powerhouse. TSLA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nFSD and robotics look promising, but ambition doesn't promise success. However, despite Musk's claim, Tesla likely has a bright future, supported by strong leadership in EVs and a growing energy business. Investors can buy into Tesla on that alone, with FSD and AI robotics being potential catalysts for Tesla to realize its full long-term investment potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: These Could Be the Best-Performing Artificial Intelligence Stocks Through 2030",
        "content": "Every new technology has a range of outcomes. Some, like the internet, change the world. Others, like 3D printing, not so much, at least not yet. Artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a lot of hype, but it seems to have the backing of businesses and governments needed to make a tremendous impact over the coming years.\n\nAI could create fantastic new companies over time, but a handful of AI stocks are already racing to the front. These four stocks below have already benefited from an AI boost and still trade at great prices.\n\nPay attention to what their valuation is versus their expected growth. If you can divide the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio by the expected growth rate and get under 1.5, the stock could be a reasonable price for the growth you could get. This number, called the PEG ratio, is a Peter Lynch favorite.\n\nGrowth on sale is an excellent recipe for total returns, so these could be the top-performing AI stocks by 2030.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nThe U.S. government will be a massive factor in AI because the technology could become a competitive advantage against the world's other countries. Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is uniquely positioned as a software company with deep government ties. The U.S. government is over half of Palantir's revenue. Its software platforms are like an operating system for organizations, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze and use data. PLTR EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nThe company recently began posting a consistent generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, and analysts believe that earnings will continue snowballing, calling for an annual average of 72% over the long term. At just 55 times forward earnings, that leaves much room for investment returns over the rest of this decade.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nAI requires massive computing power to process vast amounts of data quickly. Chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stepped into the leadership role last year as companies frantically began spending to build these advanced computer systems. Nvidia's business (and stock) took off last year, and the company's now sitting on an estimated 90% of the AI chip market.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nNaturally, Nvidia could continue proliferating from AI's growth alone even if competitors nibble away at Nvidia's dominance. Despite the stock multiplying in value over the past year, the company's strong earnings-growth outlook makes the stock very reasonable on a forward basis. In other words, growth should carry shares higher over the coming years.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nWhat do you get when you combine one of the world's most dominating business models with AI upside? It might be social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta makes billions of dollars by advertising to its 3.96 billion monthly app users. Additionally, still-young CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has leaned heavily into building AI technology that enhances its advertising business and is a long-term wildcard. META EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nThe company hit some speed bumps in 2022 but has since rallied over 300% from its lows. Remarkably, the company's 20% estimated long-term growth rate makes its current valuation arguably a bargain for long-term investors. Given its dominance in social media, investors can hold Meta as an AI stock with a higher floor than most.\n\n4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nWhile you shouldn't assume that Nvidia will fall out of the AI chip lead, there is a reasonable chance that AI will be so big that more than one chip company can win. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) might be the next-best bet after Nvidia. The company hasn't yet felt the growth spurt that Nvidia has, but it revealed an upcoming AI chip line in late 2023 that it says will outperform Nvidia's popular H100 series. AMD EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nAMD may have to prove itself by showing the sales to back up its claims, but analysts seem optimistic about the company's broader prospects. Long-term growth estimates are over 35%, which makes the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 44 a solid price to pay for that growth. This stock may carry more risk, but the potential upside could surprise investors if AMD can make more progress in taking AI chip market share than Wall Street is giving it credit for.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

        "title": "1 No-Brainer AI Stock That Could Rise Over 90% by 2026",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) enjoyed a stellar growth year in 2023, becoming the poster child for a boom in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company benefited from a spike in demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for running and training AI models. As a result, Nvidia's stock is up more than 200% year over year alongside soaring earnings. With excitement over AI unlikely to dissipate in 2024, Nvidia appears to be on a promising growth trajectory, and earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates support this. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 50 yields a stock price of $1,200, projecting growth of 97% over the next two fiscal years. It's a lofty target but based on reasonable financial forecasts.\n\nNvidia's significant potential suggests now is an excellent time to learn more about its business and potentially invest. So, here's why the company is a no-brainer for investing in AI and tech in general.\n\nProfiting from a diversified business model\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a powerful position in tech. The company supplies its chips to companies across the industry, with its hardware powering everything from video game consoles to laptops, custom-built PCs, cloud platforms, and, of course, AI models.\n\nIn fact, the company is the exclusive supplier of chips for the Nintendo Switch, the third-best-selling video game console of all time. The lucrative partnership has provided a steady revenue stream for Nvidia and its chips have landed in the hands of millions of consumers (the Switch has sold more than 130 million units since its launch in 2017).\n\nMoreover, Nvidia has seen a boost in earnings thanks to a recovering PC market, which will likely continue improving throughout 2024. According to data from Gartner, PC shipments rose for the first time in over a year in the fourth quarter of 2023, increasing 0.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEasing inflation is fueling consumer spending, with Nvidia's PC-centered gaming segment posting revenue growth of 81% in the third quarter of 2024. The company is enjoying major gains from AI, but positions in different areas of tech make its stock one of the most reliable investments over the long term as it benefits from growth catalysts throughout the industry.\n\nNvidia has turned GPU dominance into a trillion-dollar business\n\nNvidia became the first chipmaker to exceed a market cap of $1 trillion last year, making it the world's sixth most valuable company. The tech firm has come a long way since its founding in 1993, almost singlehandedly building the GPU market into what it is today.\n\nFor years, the high-performance chips were used by and marketed toward gamers. The chips' ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously made them well equipped for the heavy workloads required for rendering video game visuals and other intensive tasks, such as cryptocurrency mining. As a result, Nvidia's GPUs have become a favorite among PC gamers who use the chips to build high-powered gaming machines.\n\nNvidia's success in desktop GPUs has seen it achieve an over 80% market share in the segment despite similar hardware from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel being available.\n\nHowever, the biggest advantage of Nvidia's command of the GPU market has been its ability to get a head start in AI. While its rivals scrambled to catch up last year, Nvidia was perfectly positioned to immediately begin supplying its chips to the entire AI market as GPU demand soared. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis chart reflects Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last year. As chip sales have skyrocketed, so has its quarterly revenue, operating income, and free cash flow. Competition in the AI GPU market is expected to heat up this year as AMD and Intel begin shipping their own offerings. However, Nvidia's estimated 80% to 95% market share will be challenging for competitors to overcome.\n\nMeanwhile, the AI market's projected compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030 indicates there will be plenty of room for Nvidia to retain its supremacy and welcome newcomers.\n\nWith Nvidia's projected stock growth of 97% by fiscal 2026, the company is a no-brainer for anyone looking to invest in AI right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Many tech corporations have brought forth innovative products and services that challenge what is possible. These products and services have also resulted in substantial gains for long-term investors. This has led to this list of must-buy tech stocks.\n\nWhile it’s easy to think about what could have been if an investor accumulated Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock in the 1990s, investors should focus on present opportunities. There are tech stocks that can double from here and reward investors as they continue to expand.\n\nInvestors looking for must-buy tech stocks leading the digital revolution may want to consider these three stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a long history of outperforming the market, and many of its top business segments are still growing.

Artificial intelligence is innovative but requires significant computing power to operate smoothly. Supermicro has seen rising demand for its solutions which should continue for a while.\n\nThe company thrived long before artificial intelligence became mainstream.

As good as the company’s 1-year gain has been, it has a proven record of outperformance.\n\nThe profitable company currently trades at a 44 P/E ratio. Supermicro looks poised to ride the AI trend and generate meaningful value for long-term investors.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) Automated stock trading concept. Robotic hand analyzing financial data on stock exchange, artificial intelligence utilization to predict precise price change in stock market. Trailblazing. trillion-dollar ai stocks.

ServiceNow aims to be the defining enterprise software of the 21st century and has over 8,100 global customers.

The firm has a 99% renewal rate among its customers and 1,987 customers with contracts exceeding $1 million in annual revenue.

At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $20.1 billion, reflecting a 232.16% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $12.30 per share and a revenue of $58.92 billion, demonstrating changes of +268.26% and +118.42%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Nvidia. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.1% higher. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 50.77. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 23.84, which means Nvidia is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nIt is also worth noting that NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.76. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Semiconductor - General industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.99.\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 235, placing it within the bottom 7% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the second-biggest maker of computer processors, gave a weak revenue forecast for the current period, echoing rival Intel Corp.’s downbeat view of the PC and data center chip markets.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Tech Giants Drop in Late Trading After Earnings: Markets Wrap UPS CEO Kicks Off Productivity Drive by Cutting 12,000 Managers Traders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers\n\nFirst-quarter revenue will be about $5.4 billion, AMD said in a statement Tuesday. The average analyst estimate was $5.77 billion. Gross margin — the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production — will be about 52%, in line with projections.\n\nThe outlook renews concerns that customers are holding off on purchases in AMD’s core markets: PCs, servers, game consoles and programmable processors. Though the company is pushing into artificial intelligence accelerators — a lucrative area where Nvidia Corp. dominates — it’s still early in that expansion.\n\nThe company unveiled a line of AI accelerators last month called the MI300. AMD has predicted sales of more than $2 billion for the lineup in 2024.\n\nAMD fell about 2% in extended trading following the announcement after closing at $172.06 in regular trading.\n\nAMD’s stock has been one of the favorite picks of investors looking for ways to bet on AI computing. Its shares are the second-best performing stock on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index this year, gaining 17%, after a similar performance in 2023.\n\nThe big question is whether AMD’s MI300 processors can challenge the dominance of Nvidia and its H100. That company’s revenue doubled in the latest fiscal year, according to estimates.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, has suffered tepid demand in the market for programmable processors, an area where it also competes with AMD. In its quarterly report last week, Intel said the lucrative market for data center processors is weakening as well. Three months ago, AMD had warned investors that demand for game console and embedded processors was slower.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD’s fourth-quarter earnings were 77 cents a share, excluding some items, matching estimates. Revenue was $6.17 billion, versus an average projection of $6.13 billion.\n\nAMD’s PC chip division had revenue of $1.46 billion, compared with a $1.51 billion estimate. Data center sales came in at $2.28 billion, just short of a $2.3 billion projection. Gaming computer-related revenue was $1.37 billion. Analysts had seen that division having sales of $1.25 billion.\n\nAMD is the second-largest maker of chips that go onto add-in graphics cards, which turn PCs into gaming machines. And it provides chips to both Sony Group Corp. and Microsoft Corp. for their consoles. Nvidia leads the market for PC add-in card chips.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company is also Intel’s largest rival in computer processors, the main component of laptops, desktops and the server machines.\n\n(Updates shares in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "3 Must-Watch Stocks Just as Unstoppable as Nvidia",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains one of the hottest stocks in the market right now, with shares eeking out yet another 2.35% gain on Monday’s session. After Nvidia stock’s January jump, shares are flirting with 30% in year-to-date gains. That’s an impressive annual return, let alone one posted in under a month. As to when (or if) shares of the chip giant are bound to reverse course remains the top question on the minds of shareholders and those enjoying the Nvidia show from the sidelines.\n\nSome way or another, NVDA stock has found a way to keep pulling rabbits out of hats, something that could easily continue through 2024. Either way, Nvidia stock remains a dangerous stock to bet against amid its AI tailwind.\n\nThough momentum investors still have lots to love about Nvidia and its latest melt-up, I’d argue it’s worth checking in on other stocks that have already gained traction in recent weeks. Indeed, many such plays may be overheated after their respective rallies. However, each is worth keeping tabs on as we march into earnings season. Let’s check in briefly with three momentum stocks as strong as Nvidia that I’d stash in the “must-watch” category.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett’s low-tech conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B, BRK-A) has been steadily (and pretty quietly) making new highs in recent sessions. Just last week, the stock hit $385 and change after enjoying a remarkable seven-day win streak. Thanks, in part, to its huge investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Japanese companies and various other firms, Berkshire Hathaway is now a stock that has something for value and momentum investors to love.\n\nThough Berkshire hasn’t been ultra active of late, it has made intriguing moves, including buying more shares of Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA). With shares of LSXMA currently trading at just 11.6 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), it’s not hard to imagine why Buffett’s firm has picked up a few more shares. Indeed, the stock looks cheap in a market that may be getting a tad overheated.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Berkshire continues playing the long-term game, it remains one of the more value-conscious picks to make the new all-time high list. And it’s worth tuning into if you’re off-put by some of the tech scene right now.\n\nT-Mobile US (TMUS) TMUS stock\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nT-MobileUS (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock also recently hit new heights after clocking in a handful of respectable quarters last year. More recently, the firm missed earnings estimates for its fourth quarter but topped on sales. Despite the initial adverse reaction, investors now seem more forgiving, given the company’s high hopes for new customer additions in 2024.\n\nUndoubtedly, the red-hot wireless play has been flying above and beyond its peers in the telecom industry. Led higher by an impressive network (it’s one to beat) and competitive prices, T-Mobile stands out as one of the market gainers that doesn’t seem content just sitting around.\n\nT-Mobile stock’s impressive performance (shares up 134% in the last five years) versus the peer group suggests the wireless scene is transforming into a winner-takes-most sort of environment. And as our high-speed data consumption grows, it’s hard not to want to jump on the T-Mobile bandwagon as it looks to enter the industry’s newest chapter of growth.\n\nAt writing, shares trade at 23.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s not a hefty multiple to pay for an industry leader with a distinct edge and a management team that knows how to get things done.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect TMUS stock to continue doing what it does best: make higher highs.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is another low-tech stock having a breakout moment, of sorts. With shares flirting with $700 per share — one more big up day will do it — COST may very well be the next momentum stock to hog the headlines should Nvidia stock’s rally begin to falter. Either way, Costco’s management seems well-equipped to make the most of the traffic surge in its stores.\n\nMany Costco shoppers have a bulk appetite for the Kirkland Signature brand (Costco’s high-quality private label) these days, and it is not a mystery as to why. Costco does private labels far better than any other large-scale retailer, in my opinion. With Kirkland, Costco shows us that consumers don’t need to compromise on quality to save money amid hard times.\n\nAs Costco expands Kirkland (perhaps they should sell Kirkland Signature gold bars next?), Costco stands out as a momentum stock that can (and likely will) grow into its seemingly expensive trailing P/E — currently 46.73.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Berkshire Hathaway (Class B) and Apple.

Following the transaction, Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s total share count in Alnylam Pharmaceuticals stood at 6,967,097, representing a 1.09% position in its portfolio and a 5.55% ownership of the biotech company.\n\nInvestment Firm Profile: Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)\n\nWarning!

        "content": "AI stocks are surging ahead with unprecedented success, building upon their stellar performance last year. Artificial intelligence firms focusing on semiconductor giants have effectively reshaped market dynamics. Moreover, China’s strategic support for more than 40 AI models has significantly bolstered this surge, marking a pivotal moment in the global adoption of AI.\n\nHowever, the anticipation surrounding AI stocks, often celebrated as market juggernauts, meets a crossroads of varied expectations as 2024 progresses. While some market watchers remain optimistic, others foresee an unmatched growth opportunity on the horizon. This divergence in market sentiment paints a complex yet fascinating landscape for AI investments.\n\nFinancially, Next Move Strategy Consulting predicts the AI market’s leap from $100 billion to a whopping $2 trillion by 2030.

        "title": "Cathie Wood's Largest Holding Isn't Tesla or Nvidia. It's This Tech Pioneer.",
        "content": "Growth investing mastermind Cathie Wood used to hold a ton of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares. However, her Ark Invest fund family has sold most of this artificial intelligence (AI) stock over the last year, cashing in on the market's AI frenzy to seed investments in less-overheated growth stocks. These days, ARK only holds Nvidia stock worth $81 million.\n\nWood's funds are actively buying shares of Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), though. With four large purchases in the last week alone, the electric vehicle and alternative energy heavyweight accounts for $763 million of Ark's stock holdings.\n\nBut that's not Wood's strongest position. In fact, Tesla is tied for third place among Ark's largest investments. No. 1 with a bullet is cryptocurrency marketplace Coinbase Global(NASDAQ: COIN) with a $911 million footprint on Ark's investment roster today. That's 6.8% of Ark's overall assets, far ahead of Tesla's 5.7% and Nvidia at just 0.6%.\n\nDespite recent sales amid Coinbase's recent price surge, this stock remains Ark's top holding by a wide margin. That's a testament to Wood's long-term vision for the cryptocurrency sector. Despite taking profits, Wood sees enduring growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, with Coinbase and the brand-new Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF(NYSEMKT: ARKB) at the forefront.\n\nMost of us ordinary investors don't manage billion-dollar funds, and what works for Cathie Wood may not be best for you and me. Still, Wood's enthusiastic stamp of approval may indicate a stock worthy of a closer look. Moreover, I'm a happy Coinbase shareholder myself. So, let's check out the reasons behind Ark's significant investment in Coinbase, examining the potential risks and rewards to help you decide if it's a fit for your own portfolio.\n\nWood's view: Coinbase holds a strategic edge\n\nCathie Wood has made it clear that she expects big things from the cryptocurrency market, and particularly the sector-leading Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) name. Her 2030 price target for the \"digital gold\" coin has been $1.48 million per token over the last year with several reiterations of the same long-term outlook. The global economy is going digital. Bitcoin's nearly inflation-free design and strictly limited supply should lead to dramatically higher coin prices over time, assuming that it remains the top crypto solution as the market evolves.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs such, she sees Coinbase as a leading nuts-and-bolts play on the asset-management infrastructure around Bitcoin and other cryptos. The company stands apart from other large service providers, such as Binance, thanks to its all-American background and proven focus on regulatory compliance. Unlike Binance, which has faced allegations of criminal activities and concerns over data security, Coinbase has maintained a cleaner regulatory profile.\n\nThis approach, in her view, positions Coinbase favorably compared to its competitors, making it a safer bet for investors looking to capitalize on the crypto market's growth. In essence, Wood sees Coinbase as a critical enabler in the broader mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. So her funds have been buying Coinbase stock when its share prices are falling due to scandals or fraud elsewhere in the crypto market.\n\nUnderstanding Ark's evolving cryptocurrency portfolio\n\nThat being said, Cathie Wood isn't strictly committed to the Coinbase opportunity. Her funds have reduced their Coinbase holdings by approximately half since June, 2023, taking cash profits off the table to reinvest in other ideas. Diversification works for big-name investors too, you know.\n\nAnd some of the former Coinbase funds have moved into more direct Bitcoin bets. Early swings at this idea included the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust(NYSEMKT: GBTC) when it was a traditional fund and not a more flexible exchange-traded fund (ETF). Nowadays, Ark Invest manages its own Bitcoin-based ETF -- and some of her other funds already own shares of the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSo Wood isn't putting all her encrypted apples in the same digital cart, but spreading her cryptocurrency exposure across a couple of different asset classes. Even so, Coinbase remains Ark's largest holding, not just in the crypto sector but among the entire stock portfolio.\n\nMy own Coinbase investment plays a smaller part in the total portfolio. Coinbase shares account for roughly 3.6% of my stock investments today. It's my biggest crypto bet by far but only the seventh-largest position among 35 stocks and ETFs.\n\nSo I suppose my Bitcoin exposure is comparable to Cathie Wood's, but on a smaller scale. Is this a case of \"great minds think alike\" or two Bitcoin investors making the same mistakes independently?\n\nOnly time will tell -- but I'm sticking with my diversified Bitcoin investments with Coinbase in the pole position, and Cathie Wood follows a similar playbook. Whether your own Bitcoin strategy follows suit or explores completely different avenues, it's safe to say that a little bit of Bitcoin exposure makes sense in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coinbase Global wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio), the renowned investment management firm, has recently increased its investment in Nanobiotix SA, a company at the forefront of nanotechnology in cancer treatment. On December 1, 2023, Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) added 932,835 shares to its position, bringing the total number of shares held to 2,869,030. This transaction was executed at a trade price of $5.81 per share, reflecting a 48.18% change in the firm's holdings and a 6.21% ownership in Nanobiotix SA. Despite the significant addition, the trade had a negligible impact on Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio, with the position accounting for just 0.02% of its total investments.\n\nInvestment Management with a Century of Expertise\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NBTX.\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s legacy spans over a century, with a focus on prioritizing existing clients' interests and maintaining the integrity of its investment strategies. The firm manages assets for some of the world's largest professional investors, including pension funds and financial institutions across various continents. Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s investment philosophy is rooted in a long-term, bottom-up approach, emphasizing fundamental analysis and proprietary research to identify companies with sustainable growth potential. The firm's top holdings include prominent names such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), MercadoLibre Inc (NASDAQ:MELI), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), with a significant equity of $126.19 billion predominantly invested in the Technology and Consumer Cyclical sectors. Baillie Gifford Bolsters Stake in Nanobiotix SA\n\nNanobiotix SA: Pioneering Nanotechnology in Cancer Treatment\n\nNanobiotix SA, listed under the stock symbol NBTX and headquartered in France, made its public debut on December 11, 2020. The company is dedicated to revolutionizing cancer treatment by enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy. Its flagship product candidate, NBTXR3, is designed to amplify the impact of radiotherapy on tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues. Nanobiotix operates primarily in the biotechnology industry, with a market capitalization of $385.36 million.\n\nStory continues Baillie Gifford Bolsters Stake in Nanobiotix SA\n\nMarket Performance and Valuation of Nanobiotix SA\n\nSince its IPO, Nanobiotix SA's stock price has experienced a decline of 56.12%, but it has shown signs of recovery with a year-to-date increase of 11.37% and a significant gain of 40.79% since Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s trade date. Despite the recent uptick, the stock is currently labeled as a \"Possible Value Trap\" by GuruFocus, urging investors to think twice before investing. The GF Value of the stock stands at $4,267.07, but with a current stock price of $8.18, the price to GF Value ratio is not applicable, indicating that the company may not be undervalued. The GF Score of Nanobiotix SA is 48/100, suggesting poor future performance potential.\n\nStrategic Alignment with Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s Investment Philosophy\n\nThe addition of Nanobiotix SA to Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio aligns with the firm's strategy of investing in companies with the potential for sustainable, long-term growth. Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s expertise in identifying such opportunities is evident in its diverse portfolio, which includes a mix of high-growth technology and consumer cyclical companies. The firm's decision to increase its stake in Nanobiotix may signal confidence in the company's innovative approach to cancer treatment and its growth prospects.\n\nAssessing the Impact of Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s Trade\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent acquisition of additional shares in Nanobiotix SA could have several implications for its portfolio. Although the trade represents a small fraction of the firm's total investments, it may indicate a strategic move to capitalize on the potential upside of Nanobiotix's innovative cancer treatment solutions. The timing of the trade, amidst a recovering stock price, could also suggest that Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) sees a favorable risk-reward scenario unfolding for Nanobiotix.\n\nFinancial Health and Future Prospects of Nanobiotix SA\n\nNanobiotix SA's financial health, as indicated by its Financial Strength and Profitability Ranks, presents a mixed picture. The company's balance sheet receives a moderate score of 5/10, while its profitability and growth ranks are currently at 0/10, reflecting challenges in these areas. The GF Value Rank is also low at 2/10, suggesting that the stock may not be undervalued relative to its intrinsic value. However, with a Momentum Rank of 6/10, there could be short-term trading opportunities based on recent price movements.\n\nConclusion: Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s Calculated Bet on Nanobiotix SA\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s increased stake in Nanobiotix SA is a noteworthy development for investors tracking the firm's moves. While the trade's impact on the overall portfolio is minimal, it underscores Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s confidence in Nanobiotix's potential to disrupt the cancer treatment landscape. Investors following this transaction should consider the company's innovative approach, current market performance, and Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s long-term investment philosophy when evaluating the prospects of Nanobiotix SA.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Microsoft’s current P/E ratio is just below 40 times. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s P/E ratio is above 81 times.\n\nNvidia commands a higher premium due to the monetization of AI. Thus, the more Microsoft can monetize AI, the higher its shares can rise. Of course, Microsoft has done so with its monetization of CoPilot. However, that hasn’t been nearly as successful as Nvidia’s monetization through chip sales, which remain in high demand for AI applications.\n\nIt’s an opportunity for Microsoft, arguably making it a buy at the moment despite recently surpassing a $3 trillion valuation.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.\n\nSource: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s a bad idea to bet against McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock right now. The Golden Arches are operating very well at the moment and are also seeking real, substantial growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors considering McDonald’s a boring, slow-growth firm should think again. In December, the company announced that It plans to increase its footprint to 50,000 restaurants by 2027. That will be its fastest period of growth in history.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s also evident that McDonald’s is attempting to win back market share from competitors—namely, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). The company continues to test its CosMc’s restaurant concept. Long wait times suggest that the restaurant concept has the potential to rest market share from Starbucks with its expansive drinks menu.\n\nAll of that positive news follows a Q3 earnings report, which showed an 11% increase in global system-wide sales. It is little wonder that some analysts expect 2024 will be very strong for McDonald’s, which has caused them to up their ratings.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is little reason to believe that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock should rise soon. Salesforce is in something of a dead zone despite its strong performance of late.\n\nIn the third quarter, Salesforce provided better-than-expected results, including revenues that increased by 11% to $8.7 billion. The better-than-expected performance provided the company the confidence to raise guidance for multiple metrics. That’s all on top of a year that saw Salesforce shares amongst the best performers on the Dow Jones Index.\n\nThe problem is Salesforce’s revenues are expected to grow by 10% in Q4. That’s not a strong enough catalyst to propel CRM shares higher. Instead, investors should look forward to rate cuts expected to begin in June per most consensus opinions.\n\nLower lending rates should Galvanize greater investment in customer relationship management overall. Salesforce continues to heavily tout its AI investment in that regard. Furthermore, it’s also the dominant force in the space. However, investors are going to have to wait a few months for that catalyst to kick in.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) An image of a tan building corner with a blue \"P&G\" logo, an American flag on a post, and two larger building tops in the background under a dark blue sky.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs long as consumers are willing to absorb higher prices, there’s no reason to bet against Procter & Gamble’s (NYSE:PG) stock.\n\nThat’s the message that the market sent upon P&G’s Jan. 23 earnings release. Sales grew by a modest 3% during the most recent quarter, but that didn’t matter despite being a slight miss. What did matter is that Procter & Gamble continues to be able to pass higher prices on to consumers, leading to improved net income.\n\nP&G now expects that net income growth will range between 8 and 9%. It had expected the range to be between 6% and 9% prior. Consumers continue to absorb price increases for their favorite fast-moving goods brands.\n\nThat was the primary takeaway of the stock market on Jan. 23. Shares jumped from $147 to $155 on the earnings release and the news contained therein. Procter & Gamble will continue to rise because consumers remain undeterred.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nResilient consumers are also the primary positive factor for Visa (NYSE:V). Its stock is rising after releasing earnings that showed better than anticipated results. The reason: strong consumer credit spending.\n\n2023 was the year of strong consumerism fueled by credit spending. 2024 is shaping up to be no different. Visa saw its revenues increase by 9% in the first quarter on especially strong cross-border payment volume. American consumers continue to travel in record numbers following the pandemic.\n\nIt’s also clear that if a recession is avoided entirely, consumer credit spending plays a large part in the result. Further, net income increased by 17% during the period.\n\nWhile many companies are looking for ways to find greater efficiency at the moment, Visa has no such problem. Its bottom line results reflect that truth. Again, there’s no reason to bet against Visa, given consumer credit usage over the past year.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarly expectations suggest that the Vision Pro will be another success for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, it’s unlikely that the Vision Pro will do much to send AAPL stock higher in the near term.\n\nFurther, despite strong early pre-release sales, it’s also likely that Vision Pro demand will be limited. Current demand data based on pre-release sales suggest that early enthusiasm is limited to developers and power users.\n\nThe Vision Pro was never expected to be a vital contributor to Apple’s top line at any rate. Apple analysts expect the company to easily sell more than 500,000 headsets, priced at $3,500 apiece. That’s not much for a company of Apple’s stature.\n\niPhone sales continue to be Apple’s bread and butter. Fortunately for Apple investors, there is good news. The iPhone is now the most popular brand in China. That’s particularly good news: Apple had courted other populous Asian nations as China’s economy struggled during 2023.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is currently engaged in a period of growth through consolidation. The company recently agreed to purchase Hess (NYSE:HES) for $60 billion.\n\nIt’s part of a larger wave of consolidation in the energy sector. It’s also one that has drawn the attention of antitrust investigators. While there is no clear indication of the potential outcome, one thing should be noted.\n\nLarge energy firms had a banner year in 2022 after a long dry spell. 2023 was a problematic year again. 2024 is offering signs that are both positive and negative. Demand could remain weak, however, simultaneously, so your political tensions remain high, and crude oil prices have risen lately.\n\nAll things considered, it’s fair to argue that Chevron is subject to many factors that could lower its prices. Chevron’s merger with Hess could just as easily go through, and oil prices could rise, ushering in an era of renewed strength. However, the energy sector faces long-term threats worth considering.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 30, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Silicon Motion Technology SIMO, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Allegro MicroSystems ALGM and Ambarella AMBA.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Semiconductor Stocks Poised to Beat Estimates This Earnings Season\n\nThe overall earnings for the semiconductor industry this earnings season is expected to be better than the year-ago quarter. After a challenging period marked by economic headwinds and disruptions in the supply chain, semiconductor stocks appear to be on the brink of a significant comeback, fueled by a steady increase in sales.\n\nThe semiconductor market grappled with challenges arising from pandemic-induced disruptions in the supply chain and the Federal Reserve's stringent monetary policies, which subdued demand and led to a decline in sales. However, with the easing of inflationary pressures and a gradual recovery in demand, the industry has been on an upward trajectory since the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe advent of generative AI has further attracted investments. The technology has already proven beneficial across a variety of industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy and utilities and video game development.\n\nThe growing proliferation of generative AI has boosted the demand for chips, benefiting semiconductor sales. According to the latest data released by the Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales grew 5.3% to $48 billion in November 2023, marking the first year-over-year increase since August 2022. This year-over-year rise also came after eight consecutive months of sequential growth, signifying a strong recovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow to Make the Right Choice?\n\nWith the presence of several industry participants, finding the right tech stocks with the potential to beat on earnings can be daunting. However, our proprietary methodology makes this task fairly simple.\n\nYou could narrow down your choices by looking at stocks that have the perfect combination of two key elements — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).\n\nEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have maximum chances of beating estimates in their next earnings announcement. It is the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with this favorable mix of ingredients, the odds of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.\n\n4 Semiconductor Stocks That Match the Criteria\n\nSilicon Motion Technology has an Earnings ESP of +4.92% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe company is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 6. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has increased 5 cents upward to 76 cents per share over the past 30 days.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. has an Earnings ESP of +3.68% and currently has a Zacks Rank of 2.\n\nThe company is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has increased by a penny to $4.49 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nAllegro MicroSystems currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.16% and a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nThe company is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 1. The consensus mark for earnings has been steady at 29 cents per share over the past 60 days.\n\nAmbarella is expected to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 27. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.60% and a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nThe consensus estimate for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 33 cents per share, 5 cents narrower than the loss of 38 cents expected 60 days ago.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Super Micro Computer shares rose nearly 11% before the bell on Tuesday after the artificial intelligence server maker delivered blowout quarterly results and raised its full-year revenue forecast significantly ahead of Wall Street estimates.\n\nThe company, which counts NASA and Japan's NEC among its customers, lifted its fiscal 2024 revenue forecast range to $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion from $10 billion to $11 billion, and above analysts' estimate of $11.51 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe forecast follows a third-quarter outlook boost earlier this month that has since pushed the San Jose, California-based company's market value $10 billion higher to $27.53 billion, and lifted other AI-related companies.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the biggest beneficiary of the AI hype, rose 1% on Tuesday, while Microsoft, which is expected to report results after market close, added 0.8%.\n\n\"There is a renewed feeling of optimism around the potential size and longevity of this AI boom,\" said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.\n\n\"Microsoft shareholders will hope that the company's early investment into AI continues to pay dividends, with record revenues of $61 billion expected.\"\n\nSupermicro's stock has more than tripled since May last year when CEO Charles Liang said the generative \"AI momentum has benefited Super Micro greatly.\"\n\nThe stock, which closed at a record high on Monday, was last up at $548.49 and set to hit a fresh peak at market open.\n\nSuper Micro reported a 17% jump in third-quarter net sales to $3.66 billion from a year earlier, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.59 - both above its latest forecast from less than two weeks ago.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected $2.87 billion in revenue and $4.55 EPS.\n\nSupermicro trades 24.9 times its earnings estimate for the next 12 months, below Nvidia's multiple of 30.5, per LSEG data. A lower multiple indicates the stock is trading cheaper compared to its earnings potential.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has joined a $150 million capital infusion for chatbot-builder Kore.ai, making its latest investment in an AI sphere that’s become reliant on its high-end chips.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Traders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet UPS to Cut 12,000 Jobs, Bring Workers in Five Days a Week Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts\n\nFTV Capital led the round for Kore.ai, which plans to use the financing to develop more virtual assistants for global brands, the company said Tuesday. The Orlando-based startup counts enterprise customers including Coca-Cola Co., Airbus SE and Roche Holding AG, it said. LG Electronics Inc. runs its chatbot to support online shoppers for its products.\n\nNvidia, an existing Kore.ai backer before its latest round, has struck a number of deals with up-and-coming AI firms over the past year, including investments in Hugging Face, Cohere and Mistral AI. Nvidia, whose chips are fundamental to the training and development of generative AI, is among those betting on the technology’s potential since OpenAI’s ChatGPT debuted more than a year ago. It’s made over a dozen investments in AI startups in 2023 alone, mainly in companies that build using its sophisticated processors.\n\nIts backing is an endorsement for Kore.ai, which is counting on AI going mainstream among enterprises looking to automate their business. It currently automates 450 million daily interactions involving about 200 million consumers, and is headed for an initial public offering, the company said.\n\nKore.ai’s revenue has grown at triple-digit percentages in past years, founder and Chief Executive Officer Raj Koneru told Bloomberg News, without divulging specifics. “We’ll have the scale and process in place to be able to have an IPO in about two years,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nKoneru, who was born in India, founded the Orlando, Florida-based company in 2014.

        "title": "3 Hot ETFs to Buy for January 2024",
        "content": "Exchange traded funds, or ETFs, allow investors to very easily and cheaply obtain exposure to a group of stocks. For example, some ETFs focus on stocks within a single country, while others reflect the performance of equities in one sector. Meanwhile, others focus on companies of a certain size such as only small-cap or large-cap stocks. ETFs tend to pose much less risk than individual stocks, and some of their fees are quite low, making them more appealing than mutual funds with high charges. For investors who want to buy ETFs whose themes are currently in vogue with the Street, here are three top ETFs for January 2024.\n\niShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFueled largely by justified bullishness about the positive impact of the artificial intelligence boom on chip makers, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SOXX) zoomed up 35% higher between October 31 and Jan. 26.\n\nIndeed, data centers are buying a huge number of chips to create AI, and they are purchasing many more semiconductors to enable computers to conduct AI-powered functions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, PC sales are beginning to rebound as companies and consumers discard the many desktops they purchased during the pandemic and replace them with new ones. And investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald predicts that data centers’ overall demand for chips is about to start increasing as well.\n\nThe ETF’s three largest holdings, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), all have tremendous exposure to the AI Revolution, and all three have rallied sharply since October.\n\niShares MSCI India ETF (INDA)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe very well-regarded consulting firm, Deloitte,recently issued a very bullish report on the Indian economy. I’m also feeling upbeat on India’s economy and on the iShares MSCI India ETF (BATS:INDA).\n\nThe firm says that, in the last decade, the nation took actions to convert its capabilities into unique products and solutions. More specifically, the Asian country has emphasized tech and high-end manufacturing. Deloitte now expects the nation’s economy to expand by a very impressive 6.9% to 7.2% , above inflation, during its current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, economists are upbeat on the country’s outlook. A poll of economists by Reuters revealed that, on average, they expect the nation economy to expand at a 6.9% clip this year. Also encouragingly, most of those polled expect India’s inflation rate to drop going forward.\n\nGiven India’s strong outlook, I view INDA stock as one of the top ETFs for January 2024.\n\nVanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund (VCLT) A question mark among various percentages. higher interest rates, Fed rate hikes\n\nSource: travellight / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s an excellent chance that inflation will continue to trend downward in the medium-term and the long-term. Those wishing to bet on that trend should consider buying the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund (NASDAQ:VCLT).\n\nShowing that inflation is indeed slowing sharply, last quarter the core personal-consumption-expenditures price index came in at an annualized rate of 2%. This was in-line with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s target. As a result, the Fed is very likely to cut its benchmark rate later this year, pushing interest rates down further and lifting the VCLT ETF.\n\nOver the long-term, I anticipate that the many, powerful disinflationary forces in America’s economy, such as the proliferation of AI and supply-chain improvements, will push inflation lower. Consequently, interest rates are likely to drop. And according to Morningstar, VCLT is sensitive to interest-rate changes and is likely to benefit from falling interest rates.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Technology stocks have delivered outstanding gains to investors in the market over the past decade, which is evident from the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's 431% jump in the last 10 years. These returns suggest that the Nasdaq-100 has turned a $100,000 investment into $531,000 despite periods of volatility.\n\nHowever, some stocks have outpaced the Nasdaq-100 by a huge margin. For instance, as of this writing, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has turned an investment of $100,000 into more than $15 million. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is another tech stock in this league, as a $100,000 investment made in this stock 10 years ago is now worth more than $2.2 million. The following chart shows just how lucrative an investment in Nvidia and Super Micro Computer shares has been in the past decade. NVDA Chart\n\nNow, past performance isn't an indicator of how a stock may perform in the future. But solid growth drivers make it worth taking a look at the prospects of these companies that have made investors millionaires in the past decade.\n\nSo, if you have $100,000 in investible cash after your bills are paid, loans with high interest rates are cleared, and there is enough saved for a rainy day, it may be a good idea to put that money into shares of Nvidia and Super Micro Computer. These two stocks could help you become a millionaire -- or get close to that mark -- when bought as a part of a diversified portfolio. Let's see how.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe market has rewarded Nvidia handsomely for its impressive revenue and earnings growth over the past decade. NVDA Chart\n\nThe good news is that Nvidia now has stronger catalysts -- in addition to those that have powered its growth so far -- that could help it clock even faster growth over the next decade.\n\nFor example, Nvidia was originally known for its graphics cards used in personal computers (PCs) to play video games. The company is the leader in that market, with a dominant share of 82%, according to Jon Peddie Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe good news for Nvidia investors is that the market for discrete graphics cards deployed in PCs is expected to see annual growth of 16% over the next decade, according to market research firm Imarc Group. The firm estimates that this market could generate annual revenue of $77 billion in 2032. This presents a huge incremental growth opportunity for Nvidia, considering the company generated $9.4 billion in revenue from its gaming segment in the trailing 12 months.\n\nIf Nvidia manages to maintain its share of this market in 2032, gaming revenue could multiply significantly and ensure the company sustains its robust growth momentum. However, Nvidia's dominance in another market could help drive even stronger growth for the company -- artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nThe size of the AI chip market, worth an estimated $14 billion in 2022, is expected to jump to a whopping $372 billion by 2032, based on a forecast by market research provider Brainy Insights. Nvidia controls a lion's share of this space, with an 85% share. This should pave the way for eye-popping growth in its data center business, which has generated just under $33 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months.\n\nSo, Nvidia clearly has a couple of multibillion-dollar opportunities, which explains why the company's bottom line is projected to increase at an annual pace of an impressive 102% over the next five years. That's more than double the 48% annual earnings growth Nvidia posted in the last five years.\n\nAssuming Nvidia can increase its earnings at 50% annually over the next five years, its earnings could increase to $93.50 per share in fiscal 2029 (using its projected fiscal 2024 earnings of $12.31 per share as the base).\n\nNvidia sports a five-year forward earnings multiple of 42, which it can sustain after five years, thanks to the acceleration in its growth. Multiplying the projected fiscal 2029 earnings by Nvidia's average five-year forward earnings multiple points to a stock price of just over $3,900.\n\nThat's nearly 6.5 times the company's current price, meaning this AI stock could turn a $100,000 investment into almost $650,000 in five years. So, buying $100,000 worth of Nvidia stock right now could help investors get closer to their target of becoming millionaires. And they should consider acting quickly because it is trading at 30 times forward earnings right now, a discount to its five-year average multiple.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nLike Nvidia, Super Micro Computer's growth is set to accelerate big time in the future, thanks to the growing demand for the company's AI server solutions. The following chart shows Super Micro's revenue and earnings increased at a nice clip since the beginning of 2022. SMCI Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nLooking ahead, Super Micro seems set for even faster growth. According to consensus estimates, Super Micro's revenue is expected to increase a terrific 61% in the current fiscal year to $11.5 billion. Its earnings are forecast to increase nearly 56% to $18.39 per share. More importantly, Super Micro's management believes it can continue to grow rapidly and even hit $20 billion in annual revenue within a couple of years.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Super Micro is enhancing its manufacturing capacity so that it can push \"total revenue capacity to a much higher scale than $20 billion.\" Considering how fast the market for AI servers is growing, it won't be surprising to see Super Micro's revenue eventually exceed the $20 billion mark.\n\nFoxconn predicts the AI server market's revenue could increase fivefold between 2023 and 2027 to $150 billion at the end of the forecast period. Super Micro is known for providing high-performance server and storage solutions for multiple applications, including AI, cloud computing, enterprise data centers, and 5G.\n\nEven better, the company is said to be in a solid position to gain more market share in this space, according to a Barclays analyst. That's not surprising, given that Super Micro's server platforms can be used to mount chips from multiple manufacturers, including Nvidia.\n\nAll this explains why analysts are predicting the company's earnings to grow at an annual pace of almost 40% over the next five years. Based on Super Micro's fiscal 2024 projected earnings of $18.39 per share, its earnings could land at almost $99 per share after five years if it indeed manages to clock 40% growth. Multiplying the projected earnings with the Nasdaq-100 index's (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks) forward earnings multiple of 29 points to a stock price of $2,870 after five years.\n\nThat's more than 6 times Super Micro's current price. Also, with Super Micro trading at just 7 times forward earnings right now, buying it looks like a no-brainer, considering the potential upside on offer.\n\nAs such, investors looking to add fast-growing tech stocks to their diversified portfolios -- which could help them achieve their aim of becoming millionaires in the long run -- could consider buying shares of both Nvidia and Super Micro, given the companies' big growth drivers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

(VIEW press via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is expected to report a 15.8% jump in quarterly revenue, its best growth in nearly two years, after the closing bell on Tuesday.\n\nMicrosoft has outperformed the broader market, with shares of the software giant surging over 50% growth in the past year and its market capitalisation hitting $3tn (£2.36tn).\n\nMicrosoft is currently the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, beating longtime rival Apple (AAPL).\n\nFor the quarter, Wall Street expects Microsoft to post adjusted earnings per share of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1bn, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a jump from the same quarter last year when the company posted an EPS of $2.32 on revenue of $52.7bn.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Markets up in Europe as HSBC fined £57.4m\n\nThe key metric for investors to keep an eye on will be growth in Microsoft's Azure cloud business.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG)\n\nThe parent company of Google is scheduled to announce its Q4 results during Tuesday’s post-market session.\n\nWall Street analysts maintain a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus \"Buy\" rating.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.60, indicating 52.4% growth from the previous year’s reported figure.\n\nRead more: What to expect from the Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia\n\nAlphabet's revenue is expected to be $85.24bn (£67bn), up from $76.05bn in the fourth quarter of 2022. Analysts anticipate net income to be $20.28bn, up from $13.62bn in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFurther integration of Bard with Google apps and services will also be on the lookout, but no doubt it will be a race against time against Microsoft, which has been a first-mover with its ChatGPT.\n\n“Alphabet has beaten market expectations for both earnings per share and revenue over the past three consecutive quarterly results. Investors will be hoping it can make it four in a row,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD (AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), which last month launched a new AI-focused chip aimed at challenging the early market dominance of Nvidia (NVDA), has added more than $130bn to its overall market value over the past three months.\n\nWall Street is betting its earnings will provide further proof of AMD’s AI chip potential when the company reports its results later on Tuesday.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe consensus estimate is for AMD to release revenue of $6.13bn with adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents for the quarter ending December.

As in 2023, technology stocks have been part of that rally. But this isn’t just about the Magnificent 7, or Magnificent 6 depending on how you feel about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). There are other choices to consider among tech stocks in January 2024.\n\nI know this because several tech stocks are getting Strong Buy ratings from analysts. Of all the analyst ratings, the Strong Buy is the most coveted. Many investors know that analysts often pull their punches. That means a Buy rating can mean Hold and a Hold can mean Sell.\n\nBut when analysts give a stock a Strong Buy there’s no doubting what it means. They expect the stock to move higher in the next 12 to 18 months, and usually sharply higher. Here are three tech stocks in January 2024 that have a consensus Strong Buy rating or have been receiving Strong Buy ratings in the last month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) will be a continuing boost to chip stocks in coming years. In 2023, that growth was primarily seen in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). While Nvidia is likely to outperform the market again in 2024, the chip stock with the most upside in 2024 may come from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis is an issue of supply and demand. At this time, Nvidia simply can’t keep up with all the demand for its AI chips. And even if they could, companies are hoping for options. Advanced Micro Devices has just released its MI300X GPU chipset. This could be the choice companies were hoping for, particularly if the MI300 is priced at a discount to Nvidia’s H100 GPU.\n\nAMD stock has received 13 analyst upgrades in the last 30 days making it one of the most highly rated tech stock in January 2024. While not all of them have been equivalent to a Strong Buy, Raymond James reiterated its Strong Buy rating and Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage with an Overweight rating, which is the equivalent of a Strong Buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) TMUS stock\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has taken the crown as the largest wireless carrier with 21.6 billion prepaid users. It also has a 5G network that covers 98% of the United States. That makes it the winner in the 5G battle. But what should investors make of a stock that is up 136% in the last five years, and 10% in just the last year?\n\nAnalyst sentiment suggests the answer is to continue to buy the stock. The reason is data consumption. Higher data consumption means higher earnings. That’s why T-Mobile’s leadership position means so much.\n\nTMUS stock receives a consensus Strong Buy rating. That’s backed up by projected earnings growth of 21% in the next year. And Wall Street believes that earnings growth will average 68% over the next five years.\n\nAdding to the attraction of T-Mobile is its valuation. The current P/E ratio of TMUS stock is 23.4x and its forward P/E ratio is 16.5x. That’s well below the stock’s five-year average of 44.15x.\n\nBel Fuse (BELFB) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks.\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nBel Fuse (NASDAQ:BELFB) is another popular analysts’ choice among tech stocks in January 2024. The company has a 75-year history of connecting electronic circuits. It operates through three segments: power solutions, connectivity solutions, and magnetic solutions.\n\nIt’s a steady business that is essential to other industries. In 2024 that list will include aerospace, defense, and rail. The company is also projecting demand to increase in AI, Space and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure in 2024 and beyond.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s a growth giant. In fact, in the last quarter, it’s revenue was down year-over-year. But the company is posting impressive margin expansion. In 2019, it’s gross margin was 22.9%. Last year that was up to 32.5%. This level of expansion appears to be sustainable, and with a stock that’s trading at 10.5x forward earnings, BELFB looks to be an undervalued pick among tech stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Your money won’t do much good sitting in your bank account because of dismal rates on savings accounts. While there is a benefit to using certificates of deposit to get higher rates, the stock market offers more exciting returns. Most notably, those facing future industry investment opportunities.\n\nYou may not have to look any further than these top seven stocks to uncover those very future industry investment opportunities.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a cybersecurity firm that offers next-gen cybersecurity tools. The firm continues to maintain high revenue growth while experiencing meaningful profit margin expansion. For example, the company reported 20% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Growth in remaining performance obligations outpaced revenue growth which is a good sign for future revenue figures.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNet income surged by 871% year-over-year. Continued net income growth can make the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio far more appealing. That’s the primary weakness for PANW, but long-term investors will have an easier time overlooking the current valuation. Shares trade at a 64 forward P/E ratio which can drop considerably if net income growth remains elevated.\n\nThe stock has more than doubled over the past year and is up by 367% over the past five years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top stocks seeing substantial future industry investment opportunities is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which became a trillion-dollar company. Growth in its tech and artificial intelligence (AI) segment is still strong and helped Nvidia more than triple its revenue year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nNvidia recently announced RTX Video HDR which uses AI to improve video quality. Developers can use this resource to improve the quality of games and video. Streamed videos can enhance streamed videos to 4k and offer a better experience for viewers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s one of the many ways Nvidia is using artificial intelligence to give consumers and businesses better products and services. Nvidia also partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to help sellers create better product listings with artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia has partnered with many corporations to expand its dominance in the artificial intelligence industry. Shares are up by 219% over the past year and recorded a five-year gain of 1,587%.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) is helping business owners protect their websites from cyberattacks. The firm serves over 30% of the Fortune 1,000 and has over 182,000 paying customers.\n\nCloudflare has grown rapidly since its 2010 launch and has amassed a $27 billion market cap. Even with the historical growth, Cloudflare continues to report solid revenue growth. The company exhibited 32% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net losses narrowed by 44.7% year-over-year and sat at $23.5 million.\n\nCloudflare is strengthening its offering with the help of artificial intelligence. Workers AI has helped Cloudflare strengthen its efforts to keep customers and users secure. Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, mentioned in the Q3 2023 press release that the company is making more investments in AI.\n\n“By the end of 2024, we expect to have inference-optimized GPUs running in nearly every location where Cloudflare operates worldwide—within milliseconds of every Internet user,” he stated.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) logo on a smartphone which is next to a miniature shopping cart and miniature cardboard boxes\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) offers e-commerce software that helps other businesses run e-commerce stores. Customers pay Shopify a monthly subscription to keep their e-commerce stores up and running.\n\nShopify has a Starter plan which costs $5/mo. It’s a low barrier of entry to help people get started. The company also has high-end plans for corporations. Enterprise plans can cost thousands of dollars per month.\n\nThe recurring revenue model helped Shopify deliver 25% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. The company already has a 10% market share in U.S. e-commerce. Shopify is likely to further penetrate the industry and reward long-term investors. The firm also has a strong international presence based on its millions of merchants spread across over 175 countries.\n\nShopify has been a top-performing stock for several years. Shares are up by 73% over the past year and have gained 378% over the past five years.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a customer relationship management tool that helps businesses communicate with their audiences and get in front of potential customers. The stock has beat the market for several years. Shares are up by 69% over the past year and have gained 269% over the past five years.\n\nHubSpot has a vast customer base that consists of over 194,000 businesses in more than 120 countries. The company delivered 26% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. A 22% year-over-year increase in HubSpot’s customer base helped fuel the company’s top-line growth.\n\nWhile HubSpot has always been known for high revenue growth, the firm took a big step in narrowing its losses. The company only reported a GAAP net loss of $5.5 million. That’s much lower than the $31.4 million GAAP net loss from the same period last year.\n\nHubSpot is aiming to generate $556 million to $558 million in revenue in Q4 2023. The midpoint implies 18.5% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a vegan makeup company that avoids unethical ingredients. The company has expanded its market share in the beauty industry and continues to post incredible revenue growth.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty delivered 76% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with CEO Tarang Amin noting: “As we look ahead, the significant whitespace we see across color cosmetics, skincare, and international gives us confidence that we are in the early innings of unlocking the full potential we see for E.l.f. Beauty.”\n\nThe stock has already been on a tear and has rewarded many long-term investors. Elf Beauty shares are up by 175% over the past year and have gained 1,764% over the past five years. Net profit margins exceeded 15% in the third quarter and the stock’s forward P/E ratio is currently 51.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) operates in several verticals but specializes in online advertising and cloud computing. Google and YouTube generate most of the company’s revenue while Google Cloud has gained considerable market share over the years.\n\nWhile Google Cloud makes up a smaller percentage of Alphabet’s business, this segment delivers higher revenue growth rates than the Google advertising segment. Alphabet has a distant lead among advertising competitors and delivered 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 2023. Net income was up by 42% year-over-year.\n\nBoth of those growth rates are improvements compared to 2022 growth rates. Incorporating artificial intelligence to improve search, YouTube, cloud, and Pixel devices has helped Alphabet gain momentum.\n\nThe company has been trimming its expenses to generate higher profit margins. Alphabet is in a position to use additional capital to invest in promising long-term ventures. This approach can help the company develop an additional meaningful income stream that isn’t advertising or the cloud.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA, NET, and ELF.

        "title": "AI’s Dark Horses: 3 Underestimated Stocks in the AI Revolution",
        "content": "Almost invariably, whenever someone brings up AI stock opportunities, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the name you’ll most likely hear. If not that, then it could be Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and its multi-billion-dollar investment in artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Still, many of these enterprises now command rich premiums, especially NVDA.\n\nStill, the AI train appears to move only in one direction: northward. Per Statista, the market size in AI might reach $305.9 billion by year’s end. By 2030, the sector could hit $738.8 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.83%. And that could be an understatement. Bloomberg states that generative AI alone could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nWith so many opportunities available, below are enticing AI stock opportunities to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nA technology player specializing in enterprise AI, C3.ai (NYSE:AI) on the surface offers plenty of relevance. Per its website, the company delivers comprehensive solutions via an application development platform along with a large and expanding canvas of turnkey enterprise AI applications. Further, C3.ai enjoys a vast clientele list that encompasses manufacturing, financial services, government, utilities, and oil and gas, among many other sectors.\n\nTo be sure, AI stock gained over 54% of equity value in the past 52 weeks. However, in the trailing six months, circumstances have been less auspicious, losing nearly 37%. Unsurprisingly, analysts have become pensive on the company, pegging AI a consensus hold. Also, the average price target is modest at only $27.50, implying a bit over 9% upside potential.\n\nStill, according to Coherent Market Insights, the enterprise AI market size reached a valuation of just over $16 billion in 2022. Further, it could expand at a CAGR of 34.1% by 2030. Moreover, patient investors should note that C3.ai leverages a cash-rich balance sheet. Combined with a short interest of 36.87% of its float, AI could be one of the speculative AI stock opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage. Focus on cellphone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the past 52 weeks, Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) has already gained over 31% of equity value. So, it could be one of the AI stock opportunities. However, it doesn’t seem underestimated by most measures. Further, the company carries some controversy. With its development of the Taser – a non-lethal weapons system – along with police body cameras, it’s been thrust into recent debates involving law enforcement.\n\nAnd just for full disclosure, a Reuters article cast doubts on Axon’s “feel-good narrative” that it has deployed to justify its business. So yes, there’s some ugliness surrounding the enterprise. Nevertheless, it very well could be one of the AI stock opportunities. In particular, the company is focusing on various AI initiatives to help cut down on paperwork and other administrative matters. This way, officers can spend more time in their communities where they’re needed.\n\nPlus, the need for officers will likely accelerate in the future. For example, if former President Donald Trump wins the White House, that will probably upset a great many people. AI-integrated law enforcement is simply a reality, thus imbuing AXON with pertinence.\n\nLuminar Technologies (LAZR) Luminar (LAZR stock) sign with greenery around it\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the more compelling ideas among AI stock opportunities, lidar specialist Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) started with much fanfare. At the peak of its popularity, LAZR traded hands near $40 on a weekly average basis, per Google Finance. However, the party quickly ended there. Since then, it’s been a long, ugly ride. In the trailing one-year period, LAZR slipped 56%. Even on a year-to-date basis, it’s ugly, dropping almost 13%.\n\nStill, I suppose an argument can be made that LAZR is significantly de-risked. That’s not just a random thought. According to TipRanks, LAZR holds a consensus moderate buy view among Wall Street analysts. Further, the assessment breaks down as four buys, four holds and one sell. It’s not the greatest read but there’s the thing: the average price target stands at $6.67, implying over 145% upside potential.\n\nWhere Luminar could start making up ground is in its AI-driven initiatives. Last year, it joined forces with Plus, a global provider of autonomous solutions, to develop automated driving and safety systems for commercial vehicle manufacturers. If you don’t mind taking risks, LAZR could be one of the top AI stock opportunities at these levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Li Auto Buy Alert: Don’t Turn Down LI Stock at This Price!",
        "content": "China-based stocks had a rough start to 2024. Plus, some investors are concerned about slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, there’s no need to worry about Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI). Granted, a Li auto stock analysis shows it’s down from its peak price. However, that’s just an opportunity for folks who appreciate Li Auto’s comeback prospects.\n\nSure, automakers like Li Auto and Nio (NYSE:NIO) will probably benefit from stimulus programs in China. Yet, that’s not the only reason to consider buying Li Auto stock. Just wait until you hear about Li Auto’s vehicle-delivery objective for this year. With that information in hand, you’ll surely be tempted to grab a few shares before the price makes a big move.\n\nWhy LI Stock Ought to Be Much Higher\n\nNot long ago, LI stock sank to its lowest price since the summer of 2023. To a certain extent, this wasn’t Li Auto’s fault. Certainly, the company can’t be blamed for China’s economic issues or tepid EV demand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf these problems get resolved, Li Auto will certainly benefit from that. Yet, profit-seeking investors probably won’t have to wait around for the extrinsic issues to be resolved. Indeed, there are multiple company-specific reasons that Li Auto stock really ought to be higher than it is.\n\nFirst of all, Li Auto is a consistently profitable business. Also, InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer observed that Li Auto sells many more EVs in China than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) does. Furthermore, Li Auto has a partnership with the almighty Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in which Nvidia’s Drive Thor autonomous driving chip will power Li Auto’s ET9 electric sedan.\n\nAdditionally, Li Auto is gearing up to launch its flagship multi-purpose vehicle, known as the Li MEGA, on March 1. Moreover, Li Auto Senior Vice President Zou Liangjun recently declared that the “Li L7, Li L8, and Li L9 should sell at least 400,000 units in 2024.” That’s ambitious, as it would exceed Li Auto’s total of 376,030 vehicles sold in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi Auto Borrows a Smart Concept From Nio\n\nEven if Li Auto might strive to innovate in some ways, it’s perfectly fine if the company borrows good ideas from its competitors. A prime example would be a concept that Li Auto seems to be taking from Nio.\n\nYou may have heard of Nio’s flagship showroom, known as Nio House. It’s basically a fancy vehicle showroom that, on the inside, looks like somebody’s home. You might even be tempted to take your family to Nio House, sit in a comfy chair and just spend the day there.\n\nIt’s a concept which, I believe, makes sense in the modern age of vehicle sales. If you agree, then I encourage you to check out some photos of Li Auto’s flagship retail centers in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, China.\n\nNio reportedly had over 140 Nio House locations across multiple countries by the end of last year. So, Li Auto has some catching up to do. It will require time and capital for Li Auto to build out a network of fancy showrooms, but I think it will pay off in the long run. After all, vehicle shoppers should be more inclined to make a purchase if they enjoy the experience.\n\nLi Auto Stock Analysis: The Dip Is a Setup for a Rip\n\nAs my Li Auto stock analysis reveals, the drawdown was likely due to a number of factors, including some that the company couldn’t control. At the same time, Li Auto’s management is preparing for a year of robust EV sales.\n\nBesides, Li Auto is making a smart move as the company implements the fancy-showroom concept that Nio is already using. Therefore, I encourage you to buy LI stock on the dip and prepare for a rally in the near future.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Despite the muted enthusiasm around cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (USD-BTC) these past few weeks following the Bitcoin spot ETF approval, some blockchain stocks with growth potential could reignite investors’ bullish sentiment.\n\nThese blockchain stocks are highly rated by Wall Street, with some analysts anticipating double-digit growth for the EPS and revenue figures for these businesses in the future. Much of this optimism may come in the wake of new liquidity being injected into the market from institutions as time moves on — a consequence of the Bitcoin spot ETF approval we saw recently.\n\nOther tailwinds that could power the returns of these firms include the wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a valid investment. Research unveiling facts like these coins being able to improve a portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns may be appealing to the majority of investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are some blockchain stocks with growth potential for investors to consider.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Flags of Coinbase and NYSE flying in the wind.\n\nSource: rarrarorro / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) remains a major player in the blockchain and cryptocurrency exchange market. It also plays a key role in the administration of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Specifically, it is listed in the SSA Surveillance Sharing Agreement (SSA) role in of 8 out of 11 firms that have applied for spot BTC ETF approvals.\n\nCOIN also plays a role in the facilities of custody and finance of these ETFs, which makes the company strongly positioned in the future.\n\nAlthough Wall Street currently rates COIN as a ‘Hold,’ analysts are very bullish on the prospect for its fundamentals to improve. Notably, revenue is expected to surge 16.87% in FY2024, while its EPS is predicted to increase from -81 cents to -19 cents.\n\nThis makes COIN one of those blockchain stocks with growth potential.\n\nRiot Blockchain (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) focuses on cryptocurrency mining, primarily Bitcoin. It’s one of the largest crypto mining operations in North America.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s stock is up 91.08% over the past year, and things look like they could be even more accretive for investors. A further upside of 44.58% is expected over the past year, and Wall Street rates it as a “Strong Buy.”\n\nA 61.33% top-line increase is expected for FY2024, while EPS is also expected to increase as the brand edges toward profitability.\n\nOne of the key reasons I’m bullish on RIOT is due to its improving top and bottom lines, but also that its book value per share may increase substantially amid the Bitcoin halving event that will occur in April.\n\nRIOT holds 7,362 Bitcoins with a market value of $310,011,317. As Bitcoin tends to rally before and after the halving event takes place, we could see a substantially stronger balance sheet for RIOT, which could cause some investors to surmise that it’s undervalued based on the assets on its balance sheet.\n\nRIOT is then one of those blockchain stocks with growth potential.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) premium valuation at around 80 times sales, I think it’s important to put this in context with its growth potential. And a substantial amount of that growth predicted to come from the blockchain industry.\n\nNVDA stock’s GPUs are crucial for cryptocurrency mining, which is an integral part of blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD). There are also more cryptocurrencies released every day that support GPU mining, and I expect that this trend will accelerate in the future as the awareness of the cryptocurrency industry spreads and becomes more accessible.\n\nAlthough falling considerably short of last year’s astronomical leap in EPS (621.54%), FY2024 also looks to be very attractive on the EPS front for NVDA. Analysts expect that its EPS will climb 67.57% during this period and that it will continue to increase by low double-digit amounts until 2028.\n\nInvestors, therefore, should keep a close eye on NVDA.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Driven by a projected market surge to $1.09 trillion in the next six years, electrical vehicle (EV) stocks are attracting a lot of investor interest and creating EV industry investment opportunities. From Asia and Europe to the United Kingdom and the United States, countries around the world are committed to eliminating petrol vehicles in less than a decade. Thus, while many of the most prominent EV stocks are nonresistant to volatility, many provide significant upside potential, especially those driving innovation in this futuristic sector.\n\nIn recent years, EV stock investors’ portfolios have fluctuated a great deal. Much of that is due to the early-stage nature of this space, with only a few established players dominating headlines.\n\nHowever, as more competition enters the market, those looking to take a stab at this global trend may want to do so by considering the following three stocks. These three equities are among the best EV industry investment opportunities for investors looking for EV exposure now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nByd (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors don’t realize the dominance of BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF). This China-based EV maker recently surpassed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the top global electric vehicle producer. BYD’s scope is truly incredible in terms of total cars produced (including hybrids and other non-battery-powered electric vehicles).\n\nOver the past year, BYD has boomed, becoming China’s top-selling car brand. This has showcased a huge success for the company, especially since it has surpassed Volkswagen AG.\n\nAccording to the China Automotive Technology and Research Center, the company has secured an 11% nationwide market share via 2.4 million domestic car insurance registrations. Additionally, the company boasts an incredible historical 155.8% earnings per share growth rate, anticipating continued impressive growth in 2024. If the company reaches its earnings target, BYD will once again trounce the EV sector, which reduced margins have mired as cost-cutting efforts intensify.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors who seek double-digit growth rates in the EV sector ought to consider this stock. I think global growth in this space is going to dry up outside of a few key players. BYD is one of the top companies investors should consider at this point in the cycle.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis past year was great for Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI). The company triumphed as a leading Chinese EV company, currently holding the fourth position in the world’s largest EV market. Li Auto successfully delivered more than 600,000 units by year end, surpassing its monthly goal production of 50,000 in December.\n\nIn Q4, Li’s impressive 184% year-over-year deliveries growth rate was downright impressive, with nearly 132,000 unit deliveries over those three months. Additionally, the two companies proudly announced a strategic partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to create in-vehicle AI systems and autonomous driving.\n\nSet to launch March 1, Li Mega is anticipated to be Li Auto’s biggest order yet, already having 10,000 reservations in just two hours. Such anticipation gives investors the confidence to bet on Li Auto. Plus, with a 44% stock surge in 2023, LI stock retains its strong momentum and is one I could see continuing higher, particularly if the geopolitical climate settles down somewhat.\n\nThe Chinese EV company holds substantial growth potential, backed with a shining $12.13 billion cash buffer from Q3 2023. Now, with Nvidia by its side, the allure of Li Auto’s future models is much awaited. Recent sales data show that the company has already sold over 18,000 units as of Jan. 21, making Li Auto the top luxury brand in China’s EV market.\n\nKS Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility (KARS)\n\nPassive investors looking for exposure to this trend may not want to pick specific stocks. That’s fine, as there’s an ETF for just about any trend. My preferred option is the Krane Shares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility (NYSEARCA:KARS).\n\nThis ETF provides impressive global exposure to the EV sector at an expense ratio of 0.72%. That is high relative to other low-cost index funds tracking entire markets. However, various factors, including the breadth of exchanges many companies trade on and liquidity issues, drive this higher cost.\n\nAdditionally, it’s worth noting that this ETF also provides exposure to other trends, including hydrogen fuel, shared mobility, autonomous driving and electric vehicle production.\n\nDespite looming concerns about negative demographic shifts and deflation in China, this market still remains the dominant factor for investors in this sector. So, those who buy the KARS ETF are gaining exposure to other various global markets that may provide higher volatility. That’s something to consider.\n\nHowever, I think this ETF provides excellent diversification for those betting this secular growth trend will continue over the long term. Less than three-quarters of a percentage point is a reasonable price for investors who think this space can broadly grow by double-digit percentages over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Optimism has returned to cryptocurrency market, leaving crypto investors looking forward to the next crypto bull run. This is partially because the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) long-awaited spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF approval was finally confirmed. In the four days that followed the approval, the cumulative volume for the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $11.1 billion.\n\nThis, combined with the upcoming Bitcoin halving event — a cyclical process that halves the BTC rewards distributed to crypto miners and has historically signaled a crypto bull run — has led to predictions that a fresh all-time high is on the horizon.\n\nGeoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets, has suggested that the SEC’s spot Bitcoin ETF approval will see BTC reach a value of almost $200,000 by the end of 2025. Such a seismic estimate would require Bitcoin’s market capitalization to climb to $2.6 trillion. This represents an influx that’s set to drive non-native cryptocurrency stocks higher as a result.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese stocks could offer greater solace to investors who want to add crypto exposure to their portfolios without the risk. With these stocks, investors will not have to rely on cryptocurrency exchanges, counterparty risk or unfamiliar industry processes.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nFounded in 1989 as a business intelligence software company, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has evolved to become a form of Bitcoin proxy for Wall Street investors.\n\nGuided by co-founder Michael Sailor, MicroStrategy holds 189,150 BTC as of December 2023 and this investment strategy has caused MSTR to grow by over 90% throughout the past year.\n\n“The reason we decided to buy Bitcoin is because Bitcoin represents a form of digital gold,” explained Saylor when initially announcing the company’s crypto-focused strategy. “It’s harder than gold. It’s smarter, it’s stronger, it’s faster than gold.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe vast majority of MicroStrategy’s market capitalization is Bitcoin. Therefore, the software firm is an excellent option for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency markets without having to go through the rigmarole of navigating the crypto landscape and using cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nFor investors, this can be a major benefit of MSTR. Trust in crypto took a significant knock during the high-profile collapse of the FTX exchange. Reports of wallets being targeted by cybercriminals may steer investors to embrace MicroStrategy’s safe entry point.\n\nIn addition to this, MicroStrategy’s fundamentals appear promising. The firm’s Q3 2023 revenue was $129.5 million, representing a 3% increase year-over-year. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s consolidated statement of operations was $45 million, equating to a 16% increase year-over-year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. crypto bull run\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) needs little introduction following an astonishing 2023 performance. The semiconductor giant has been buoyed by the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It experienced almost 200% growth over the past year to achieve a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion.\n\nThe market position of Nvidia has been solidified by the firm’s status as a market leader in the production of graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nThis status has helped the company to create the GPUs that are set to support the widespread adoption of generative AI software by enterprises in the future. However, these processors are also likely to become essential in cryptocurrency mining and production.\n\nOn an operational level, Nvidia is making good use of its newfound status as a generative AI leader. The company’s return on equity stands at 57%, comfortably surpassing the industry average of 15%.\n\nThis helps to clarify Nvidia’s five-year net income growth of 28%. Additionally, it provides the semiconductor leaders with a strong platform to continue innovating ahead of its industry rivals.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Block logo on screen in hand on background of stock market chart. crypto bull run\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) has evolved to add high levels of exposure to cryptocurrencies in recent years.\n\nKnown best as a payments provider, Block’s CashApp offers users a convenient way of buying, selling and transferring crypto. Co-founder, Jack Dorsey, is a keen cryptocurrency enthusiast. Investors are likely to see Block’s relationship with assets like Bitcoin strengthen in the future.\n\nAccording to Block’s Q3 2023 earnings, the firm’s total net revenue reached $5.62 billion in the quarter, representing a 24% increase year-over-year. Crucially, Bitcoin revenue accounted for 43% of net revenue.\n\nWith the company’s profit increasing 21% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and its flagship product, CashApp showcasing 27% growth and profits of $984 million, Block represents a strong stock that’s likely to see plenty of upside in a cryptocurrency bull market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nasdaq 100’s Hidden Gems: 7 Tech Stock Bargains Ready to Boom",
        "content": "Coming off a year where the Nasdaq 100 gained 55%, you wouldn’t expect there to be many Nasdaq 100 tech bargains, let alone the index to have a repeat performance in 2024. Yet, the technology-laden benchmark is leading the way again a month into the new year. It’s up over 3% so far in January, which would lead to another annual gain of about 45% if it maintained that pace!\n\nOf course, it’s unrealistic to expect the market to keep growing like that. For example, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) just offered near-term guidance that cut the knees out of its stock, and other chipmakers sympathized. Semiconductor stocks had been among the best performers last year. You can expect continued volatility in the sector and other markets, too.\n\nEven so, while the index is still near its all-time highs, Nasdaq 100 tech bargains are available. What follows are the seven best opportunities to cash in on future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: Cisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe reason Intel’s guidance sucked was because companies are rushing headlong into artificial intelligence (AI) data center chips and away from standard processors. While Intel is late to the game, those same forces are exactly why Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is taking off. Shares are up 10% over the past few months. I see that as only the beginning.\n\nCisco sees massive orders piling up for its AI-based Ethernet architecture that runs under the GPU architecture. CEO Chuck Robbins sees $1 billion in order flow coming in fiscal year 2025, or twice as much as previously predicted. That’s because that’s when the Ethernet buildout will really take off. Cisco already has its Ethernet fabric deployed at three major hyperscalers. The world’s four largest hyperscale platforms are Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Together, they account for around 78% of total capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco also works with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and even Intel to develop Ethernet technologies for GPU-enabled infrastructure. That makes the networking hardware leader part of this tightly-knit growth industry that shows no sign of letting up.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe ongoing buildout of the cloud also means the data transitioning from brick-and-mortar data centers needs protection. Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government organizations. And it’s not just with the underlying architecture where AI plays a leading role. Next-generation data and app security driven by AI tools is in high demand. After two disappointing quarters, though, Fortinet is growing again.\n\nMuch of the cybersecurity specialist’s business was centered around hardware-based firewalls monitoring traffic for physical data centers. As we said before, enterprise spending was moving to the cloud. But Fortinet has heavily invested in AI, and its secure access service edge (SASE) offerings are expanding. Fortinet says SASE is a $17 billion market growing at a 20% compounded annual rate and is expected to hit $36 billion by 2027. It sees continued momentum of its SASE solutions that were adopted by internet providers, including AT&T (NYSE:T), British Telecom (OTCMKTS:BTGOF), Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), and others.\n\nFTNT stock is up 50% from the lows it hit after earnings, but more growth will come.\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: Lam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe pell-mell rush into AI chips also boosts Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), the premier manufacturer of specialized semiconductor equipment. Its etch and deposition tools allow for more sophisticated chips and advanced packaging techniques that AI requires. Etching is the selective removal of film and material from a wafer to create features customers want.\n\nThis is another tremendous growth opportunity because of the new chip design technology under development. Called gate-all-around (GAA), manufacturers can have material on all four sides of a transistor instead of three. It could greatly increase chip speed and efficiency.\n\nLam Research sees it as alone being a $1 billion opportunity. As Lam is one of the few equipment manufacturers that could handle such an increase, it can reap the benefits. It is already approaching a 75% market share in the space.\n\nSales and profits are growing, as its recently released earnings report indicated. Yet, trading at only 23 times next year’s earnings estimates is a bargain stock to buy.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is also cashing in on the demand for cybersecurity products. Unlike Fortinet, however, it has been hitting the mark each quarter. Its stock is up 115% over the last 12 months and is 16% higher so far this year. Sales and profits are on a rocket-ride higher with earnings increasing 10-fold year over year last quarter.\n\nDriving this performance is its new AI-powered Cortex platform (I’m sensing a theme with what makes a business successful these days). Cortex now has 5,300 customers, up 25%, and it was the first to achieve 100% detection and prevention from cyberattacks in industry-standard testing.\n\nWhat sets Palo Alto Networks apart from the crowded cybersecurity field is its agnostic approach to protection. It offers SASE products, cloud, on-site, hybrid protection solutions, next-gen firewalls, and more. By giving the customer what it wants, it has met the broadest needs of the market. With Wall Street expecting earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years, Palo Alto Networks should record a sonic boom in growth.\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: ASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLike Lam Research, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) offers specialized semiconductor equipment for AI chip production. It differs from the competition because it has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. It is the world’s only manufacturer of the machines needed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel, Samsung, and other chipmakers.\n\nThese machines are not exactly mass-produced either. It built just 345 lithography systems last year, 81 immersion systems, and only 40 EUV machines. But what it lacks in volume, ASML makes up for in price. The EUV equipment, for example, goes for around $200 million a pop.\n\nYet ASML is in the process of further cementing its dominance by developing next-generation high-numerical aperture (high-NA) lithography systems. These will allow its customers to produce even smaller chips. They’re also not bargain-basement priced. These next-gen machines sell for about $300 million each. It shipped the first one to Intel in December.\n\nThat’s why the stock is still undervalued despite ASML stock trading at an all-time high. It already enjoys rich profit margins, and analysts forecast it will grow earnings 24% annually for the next five years.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facade\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe ongoing 5G infrastructure rollout is arguably the biggest driver of future growth for telecom giant T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). It marks the first major upgrade to the country’s telecom infrastructure, allowing greater download speeds. Because data consumption is the biggest profit center for telecoms, the upgrade will help boost earnings further. The analysts at PwC forecast global data consumption over telecom networks will grow nearly three-fold from 3.4 million petabytes (PB) in 2022 to 9.7 million PB in 2027.\n\nT-Mobile stands to benefit the most as it recently became the largest U.S. wireless carrier, edging out Verizon (NYSE:VZ). It recorded 21.6 million prepaid users, while its rival slipped to 21.4 million.\n\nI’ve noted before Wall Street forecasts T-Mobile will enjoy an incredible run-up in earnings over the next few years. Analysts estimate profits will expand 43% a year in the long term. At that rate, the stock trades at just a tiny fraction of that growth rate. Investors can expect explosive gains to continue.\n\nRoper Technologies (ROP) Image of Roper Technologies logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) is arguably one of the most under-the-radar technology stocks. It plies its trade in application software, network software, and tech-enabled products, giving it broad market coverage. It’s not flashy like other tech stocks, but it says it is the leader in most markets in which it operates. At the same time, no single competitor competes with it over many product lines. It’s the jack-of-all-trades of tech stocks.\n\nYet Roper still mastered growth. Over the past three decades, Roper Technologies generated total returns of over 33,200%. In contrast, the S&P 500 managed just 2,100% returns. It’s up 24% in the past year and just plods on, growing year after year.\n\nWall Street expects long-term earnings growth to triple compared to the last five years. It pursues a growth-by-acquisition strategy, buying asset-light, cash-generating businesses. It then reinvests this excess cash in businesses seeking incrementally higher rates of return.\n\nRoper Technologies has a decades-long track record of success and seems equally prepared for decades of growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T stock.

        "title": "One chart shows why Big Tech earnings are critical for the health of the market rally",
        "content": "The stock market is still all about tech.\n\nNew data from FactSet shows that while strategists have called for a broadening out of the market rally, big tech companies are expected to be the drivers of Q4 earnings growth in the S&P 500.\n\nEarnings for Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to grow a combined 53.7% in the fourth quarter. The other 494 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see a 10.5% decline.\n\nFive of those companies —Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta — are set to report quarterly results this week.\n\nAfter the remaining Magnificent Seven tech stock, Tesla (TSLA), disappointed with its report, Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nThe expectations for some names are massive. Nvidia is expected to grow earnings per share by more than 400% compared to the same period a year prior. Analysts project Meta's earnings per share to grow 175% from the same period a year prior.\n\nThe eye-popping growth for some of the largest stocks in the market is expected to continue next quarter, too. A second chart from FactSet shows that Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are expected to grow earnings by nearly 80% in the first quarter of 2024. The other 496 companies, including Apple Microsoft and Tesla, are expected to grow earnings by a combined 0.3%.\n\n\"Their earnings are incredible compared to the rest of the market,\" JJ Kinahan, IG North America's CEO told Yahoo Finance Live. \"You don't often see this where a few stocks are so outperforming the rest of the market.\"\n\nTo some on Wall Street, these massive earnings expectations help explain why the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs and still might not be overvalued.\n\n\"There's more growth in that [S&P 500] valuation now than there used to be,\" Pettit said, nodding to the increased position of technology in the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the market's recent rally, nearly 90% of the growth seen in January has also been driven by the same tech companies excluding Tesla, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. This comes after the seven tech companies were the major market driver in 2023, and it creates a simple reason for why investors will be watching these reports closely.\n\nStill tech earnings expectations go beyond just the quarterly numbers. It's about updates on various market-moving narratives during earnings calls, too.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been at the center of earnings improvements for Meta and Nvidia. Microsoft and Amazon both have AI plays, too, but their cloud revenues are typically more closely scrutinized. Additionally, Apple's products business can provide a lens into demand for hardware and the overall state of consumer spending.\n\nAll of this combines to make tech earnings crucial for the market — not only because people expect Big Tech to do well but because if their results miss estimates, the lagging parts of their business could be a flashing a warning sign about an economic slowdown.

        "title": "Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 29, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\n\nBig Tech Earnings Loom: What Can Investors Expect?\n\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\n\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\n\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\n\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\n\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\n\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\n\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\n\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\n\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\n\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\n\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\n\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer's Bullish Momentum Is Overdone",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SMCI) share price experienced a dramatic daily surge, soaring over 34% following its optimistic guidance for second-quarter operating results. This increase was fueled by robust market demand and strong interest from end customers in the company's artificial intelligence servers. Over the past 12 months, shareholders have witnessed a remarkable 474% rise in the share price, skyrocketing from around $76 to $436. Given the bullish market response that has significantly driven up the share price, I believe that Super Micro Computer is currently overvalued.\n\nLeader in high-performance solutions\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with SMCI.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a leader in providing application-optimized, high-performance server and storage systems tailored to various markets and customers, including data centers, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and edge computing. The company offers an extensive product range, encompassing server and storage systems, server software management solutions and Supermicro global services. It has established a significant direct sales presence, reaching more than 1,000 customers in over 100 countries. Additionally, the company extends its reach to thousands of end users through a robust indirect sales channel. Super Micro Computer collaborates with several third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers for product design and manufacturing. Notably, it utilizes the expertise of Ablecom Technology and its affiliate, Compuware Technology, to provide critical support in contract design and manufacturing coordination.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's strategic approach is anchored in its strong engineering focus, with engineers making up half of its workforce. This engineering-centric philosophy enables it to swiftly integrate emerging technologies from major players like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and ARM (NASDAQ:ARM) into its innovative building block solutions. By designing and customizing solutions in-house, Super Micro sets itself apart from competitors, offering products that are not only cost-effective, but also excel in low power consumption and efficient heat management.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh growth in revenue and profit\n\nOver the past decade, Super Micro Computer has achieved remarkable growth in revenue and operating profit. The company saw its revenue increase in nine out of 10 years, with the only exception being a 4.6% decline in 2020, a direct result of the short-term business disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the past 10 years, its revenue climbed from just over $1.16 billion in 2013 to $7.12 billion in 2023, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 20%.\n\nWhile there was significant volatility in operating income, it followed a strong upward trend. Starting from $27.16 million in 2013, the operating income soared to more than $761 million, yielding a high annual compounded rate of return of 39.6%. The growth in operating income was particularly noteworthy in 2022 and 2023, with increases of 170% and 127%. This substantial growth in operating income can be primarily attributed to the surge in revenue, increased gross profit and relatively much lower growth in operating expenses, including research and development, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. Super Micro Computer's Bullish Momentum Is Overdone\n\nGrowth strategies and bullish guidance\n\nA key aspect of Super Micro Computer's strategy is emphasizing green computing, mainly through the advancement in liquid cooling technology. The company believes this technology can reduce data center operating costs by up to 40%, and it projects that within a few years, 20% of data centers will adopt liquid cooling to address the growing heat output challenges from GPUs and CPUs.\n\nIn terms of market growth, the company has seen significant expansion, largely fueled by its advancements in artificial intelligence technologies and their ability to be the first to market with a comprehensive set of solutions. The company is keen on continuing to ride this wave of growth, focusing on AI solutions to meet the increasing market demand. It plans to sustain its growth trajectory by offering optimized solutions across various applications, such as online gaming, cybersecurity and cloud-based storage, ensuring it remains at the forefront of technological innovation and market needs.\n\nAlong with the bullish market sentiment, Super Micro Computer recently revised its guidance for second-quarter operating performance upwards, with anticipated sales now expected to be between $3.60 billion and $3.65 billion. This is a significant increase from the previous forecast of $2.70 billion to $2.90 billion. In terms of adjusted earnings per share, the company anticipates an improvement to the range of $5.40 to $5.55, up from the initial estimate of $4.40 to $4.48. This new guidance surpasses analysts' expectations for the second quarter, set at $2.84 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $4.55. At midpoints, these revised projections indicate a 29% rise in revenue and a 24% increase in non-GAAP net income compared to Super Micro Computer's earlier guidance.\n\nStrong balance sheet for stability\n\nSuper Micro Computer maintains a conservative capital structure. The company's balance sheet shows a strong foundation with $2.17 billion in shareholders' equity and total assets of more than $4 billion. Notably, a large portion of its assets are tied up in inventories valued at over $2 billion. This reflects a strategic focus on maintaining a robust inventory to meet customer demand efficiently. Furthermore, Super Micro Computer has relatively low interest-bearing debt of $146.2 million and significant cash and cash equivalents of $543 million. This results in a net cash position of approximately $397 million, indicating a healthy financial state with ample liquidity. Such a conservative approach to capital management positions the company well for sustained growth and financial stability.\n\nQuite overvalued\n\nUpon reviewing the historical valuation chart, it becomes apparent the market has overreacted to the bullish momentum surrounding Super Micro Computer. Currently, the company is being valued at a multiple of 32 times earnings before interest and taxes, which represents the highest valuation it has seen since its initial public offering in 2007. It is worth noting that the company's average EBIT multiple since its IPO has only hovered around 11.30 times. Super Micro Computer's Bullish Momentum Is Overdone\n\nThe second-quarter revenue estimates indicate a substantial 71% increase compared to the first quarter. Considering a conservative scenario where the company maintains a sequential revenue growth rate of 20% for the remaining two quarters of 2024, the projected revenue for the year could easily reach $15.3 billion. With an average operating margin of 4.7%, the operating profit could be $719 million.\n\nApplying the historical average Ebit multiple of 11.30 to this scenario, Super Micro Computer's valuation would be only approximately $8.10 billion. On the more optimistic side, if we apply a higher multiple of 25, the company's valuation would be $18 billion. However, it is important to note that even in this bullish scenario, the valuation would still be 25% lower than the current enterprise value of $24 billion.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSuper Micro Computer has undeniably caught the attention of investors with its remarkable share price surge and optimistic guidance for the second quarter. The company's strategic focus on engineering-centric innovation and the aggressive pursuit of AI technologies further solidify its position as a key player in the industry. However, the stock market seems to have overreacted to the company's positive outlook, potentially creating an elevated level of risk for investors if it does not live up to these high expectations. I think investors should wait for a correction before initiating a long position.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 47% of His Portfolio Invested in 5 Superb Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper runs Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993, and has long been one of the brightest stars on Wall Street. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,\" by Forbes. Tepper has \"consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa's] inception,\" according to Tepper's bio posted by Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nOver the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by 15%, no small feat, given the macroeconomic backdrop. His strong track record suggests that Tepper's stock picks might be worth further review. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors might be surprised to discover that, to close out the third quarter, Tepper had a whopping 47.1% of Appaloosa's portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 11.6% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 10.2% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 9.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 8.8% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 7.2%\n\nLet's take a look at Tepper's five top picks to see why he's so heavily weighted toward these AI stocks.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms might seem a surprising choice, but the company has a long history of using AI to bolster its business. The vast majority of Meta's revenue comes from digital advertising, and AI can more accurately surface relevant ads and other content on its social media sites.\n\nAs the world's second-largest digital advertiser, the recent rebound in ad spending has bolstered the company's fortunes. Meta has also released several AI-powered tools to help advertisers more accurately connect with their target market. Perhaps as importantly, the company developed a leading open-source AI model -- Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud infrastructure platforms, resulting in an entirely new revenue stream for the company.\n\nAt just 20 times forward earnings, Meta is selling at a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Tepper's investing decision.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft saw the writing on the wall and invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the past few years, helping spotlight the potential for generative AI. Its big tech rivals quickly follow suit, kicking demand for AI into overdrive. The tech giant answered the growing demand by infusing AI functionality across a broad swath of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. Furthermore, all the most popular AI models are available on Azure Cloud.\n\nThe biggest coup, however, was the debut of Microsoft Copilot, its AI assistant. Its ability to increase user productivity has generated strong demand and could produce incremental revenue of up to $100 billion by 2027, according to analyst calculations. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the third quarter, and Microsoft pointed out that three percentage points of that growth was the result of growing demand for AI.\n\nMicrosoft is currently trading for 31 times forward earnings. While that's a slight premium to the market, the company's strong legacy businesses and the opportunity afforded by AI make Microsoft a bargain at this price, which likely didn't escape Tepper's notice.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nWhile some viewed Amazon as slow out of the gate, it has jumped into the AI opportunity with both feet. The company has long used AI to handle product recommendations, inventory levels, delivery routes, and more.\n\nYet that's just the beginning of Amazon's AI opportunity. The company is now using generative AI to improve product listings, generate review summaries, and refine advertising. It also is working on an AI-powered tool that can answer questions about specific products.\n\nThere's more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a growing list of popular generative AI models, including a few of its own via its Bedrock AI. The company has also unveiled several AI-centric chips, including Inferentia and Trainium, designed to speed AI processing for AWS customers.\n\nDespite its strong recovery last year, Amazon is still selling for just 2 times forward sales, the standard for an underpriced stock, which likely piqued Tepper's interest.\n\n4. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion about AI stocks would be complete without a nod to Nvidia, a point highlighted by Tepper's position. Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized gaming and are the gold standard for AI applications.\n\nNvidia's processors have cornered the market in both data centers and machine learning, with an estimated 95% share in each. Experience in the field helped Nvidia quickly pivot to address the growing demand for generative AI.\n\nCompetitors are scrambling to develop competing processors, but Nvidia continues to maintain its edge. For the nine months ended Oct. 29, 2023, Nvidia spent $6.2 billion, or 16% of its total revenue, on research and development. The company's track record of continuing innovation will make it difficult to supplant.\n\nDespite the stock's recent run, Nvidia is still remarkably cheap, sporting a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- that benchmark for an undervalued stock -- of which Tepper was no doubt keenly aware.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Alphabet makes the lion's share of its revenue from digital advertising, in this case fueled by Google Search. The company has an impressive track record of deploying AI to improve its search algorithms and ad targeting, and the recovering ad market will no doubt improve the company's results.\n\nAlphabet didn't sleep on the potential of generative AI. The company integrated AI functionality into many of its flagship Google and Android products. As one of the Big Three cloud providers, it was able to expand the number of AI systems available to its Google Cloud customers.\n\nIts most recent offering, Gemini AI, is being hailed by the company as its \"largest and most capable AI model,\" outperforming rivals using a variety of widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, Alphabet's Vertex AI provides access to 130 foundational AI models with something for just about every use case.\n\nThe company's rebound over the past year notwithstanding, Alphabet still sells for just 19 times forward earnings, a valuation that Tepper likely couldn't pass up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Not a lot of stocks outperformed Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in 2023. In fact, the artificial intelligence (AI) chip superstar was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.\n\nNvidia shares jumped 239% last year as the company delivered blowout results thanks to skyrocketing demand for its GPUs and accelerators, which are crucial components for the infrastructure that makes AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, Nvidia wasn't the top performer in the entire stock market. One of the handful of companies that beat it was a little-known AI stock called Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Here's how the two stocks did last year. SMCI Chart\n\nNot only did Super Micro Computer, commonly known as Supermicro, beat Nvidia, but the stock is already up 67% in 2024, meaning it's gained nearly 500% since the end of 2022.\n\nWhat is this under-the-radar stock that's soaring in the AI boom? Let's take a closer look at Super Micro Computer and whether it's a smart buy today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Super Micro Computer?\n\nIt's not a coincidence that Supermicro stock delivered results similar to Nvidia last year. The company has a lot in common with the AI chip kingpin.\n\nSuper Micro Computer makes high-performance and high-efficiency server and storage systems that are especially useful for AI applications.\n\nAs Supermicro explains it, AI workloads typically require expedited access to storage, which has driven demand for GPU-based servers. Supermicro's server systems run on Nvidia GPUs and help maximize throughput, eliminate bottlenecks, and minimize latency. The accelerated IO (input/output) of those systems can improve performance by 20% to 100% for intensive workloads.\n\nThat technology and its utility in running AI models is starting to drive significant growth at Supermicro.\n\nMuch like Nvidia did a few quarters ago, Supermicro just reported preliminary results for its fiscal second quarter that were much better than its forecast back in November. Supermicro reported revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion, compared to its earlier guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. On the bottom line, it posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.40 to $5.55, which was ahead of its prior forecast of $4.40 to $4.88.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro didn't offer much of an explanation for the soaring growth, only saying that it had strong market and end customer demand. Investors will likely learn more when Supermicro reports its complete second-quarter earnings report after hours on Monday.\n\nNvidia blazed the trail. Can Supermicro follow it?\n\nSupermicro's update was reminiscent of Nvidia's hockey-stick-like growth last year as its revenue suddenly tripled, greatly exceeding Wall Street's expectations.\n\nSupermicro appears to be on a similar path given the dramatic growth in the stock, but there's an important difference between the two companies. Supermicro operates with narrow gross margins. In the first quarter, they were just 16.7% and actually fell from the year before.\n\nTypically, a company with low gross margins does not have pricing power, or it's competing on cost. That's much different from Nvidia, which has been able to raise prices on its AI chips because there's a shortage of them and its competitors can't match its performance, at least not yet.\n\nBoth stocks also trade at reasonable valuations. In fact, Supermicro is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, including its second-quarter result. Hardware is cyclical, and the fact that SuperMicro and Nvidia have relatively low P/E ratios for their growth rates shows that the market is skeptical that the current boom will last. Unlike software, hardware isn't recurring revenue, and semiconductor companies tend to see revenue fall in down cycles.\n\nHowever, the AI boom still appears to be just getting started as hyperscalers like Oracle are building data centers as fast as they can, and the hardware needed to run them is likely to be in high demand for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere's still a lot of uncertainty in the evolving AI market, which means that Supermicro stock carries risk, but with the updated guidance, its similarities to Nvidia, and unprecedented demand for AI hardware, the upside potential clearly outweighs the downside risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

        "content": "You can earn fortune-building returns in the stock market if you can identify powerful, long-term trends -- and the businesses best positioned to profit from them.\n\nThe rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is one such trend. Here are two outstanding companies that are poised to capture a sizable share of the AI industry's profit in the coming years.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nArtificial intelligence will be built in the cloud. As the leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is well situated to profit from the AI boom.\n\nIn addition to providing the raw computing resources that power a growing number of AI applications, Amazon is striving to become a leader in generative AI. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers its customers access to powerful tools, such as its Titan foundation models, as well as AI models developed by Anthropic, Stability AI, and other promising machine learning upstarts. Better still, Amazon's highly efficient Trainium and Inferentia chips can help slash the costs of training models and running AI workloads on AWS.\n\nE-commerce remains another potent growth driver for Amazon. Global online retail sales will top $8.1 trillion by 2026, up from $6.3 trillion in 2023, according to Statista. Moreover, Amazon's cost-cutting efforts are helping to boost its operating margin as its sales rise. That's an excellent formula for rapid and sustained earnings growth.\n\nAdvertising is another notable opportunity. Third-party sellers pay hefty fees to market their products to the online retail titan's massive customer base. Amazon, in turn, is winning market share in a digital ad industry that's forecast to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, up from $531 billion in 2022, according to ResearchAndMarkets.\n\nWith these powerful trends fueling its growth, Amazon's share price could soar in the years ahead.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is also a prime beneficiary of the AI megatrend. The semiconductor giant's state-of-the-art chip designs lie at the heart of the computing systems that power many of the leading AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units can be used to train the large language models that underlie popular AI services such as ChatGPT. Demand for these cutting-edge chips is projected to soar to $400 billion by 2027, according to rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia commands more than 85% of this booming market, according to analysts at Raymond James.\n\nThe impact of this surging demand is transforming Nvidia's financial results. The tech titan's sales climbed 206% year over year to $18.1 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 29. Its adjusted operating profits, in turn, increased a stunning 652% to $11.6 billion.\n\nYet it's important to note that Nvidia is far more than just an AI growth story. Management sees a $100 billion market for the company's gaming-related chips and a $300 billion opportunity for its autonomous machine technology. All told, the company estimates its total addressable market at a whopping $1 trillion.\n\nNvidia clearly has plenty of room for further expansion, and Wall Street seems to agree. Analysts expect Nvidia's sales to grow by roughly 119% in 2024 and 57% in 2025 -- and its earnings to increase by over 100% annually over the next half-decade. Buy shares today, and you can position yourself to profit alongside this AI-powered tech titan.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The big winners of the past aren't always the big winners of the future. However, that doesn't mean that it won't be the case.\n\nIn 2023, the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks ruled the stock market. Each of the seven stocks skyrocketed by 48% or more (for some, much more). But how does Wall Street think they'll perform going forward?\n\nNot-so-magnificent forecasts\n\nWall Street has some not-so-magnificent forecasts for most of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) delivered the second-biggest gain of the group last year, with its share price nearly tripling in value. The stock is off to a good start in 2024 as well, rising more than 10%. The average 12-month price target for Meta is even lower than its current share price now, though.\n\nAnalysts don't have great expectations for Alphabet, either. The Google parent's shares vaulted 58% higher in 2023. The consensus price target for the stock today reflects a meager upside potential of around 2%.\n\nApple doesn't fare much better on Wall Street. Although the tech giant's shares jumped 48% last year, analysts' average price target for the stock is only 3% above the current share price.\n\nMicrosoft is running neck-and-neck with Apple as the biggest company based on market cap after a 57% gain in 2023. Analysts aren't looking for the momentum to continue, however. The consensus price target reflects an upside potential of around 4%.\n\nNo large-cap stock generated as much excitement last year as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The generative AI boom drove the chipmaker's share price up a whopping 239%. Nvidia has extended those gains so far in 2024, rising close to 25%. The party won't keep going, according to Wall Street. The average price target for Nvidia is less than 5% above its current share price.\n\nWall Street's favorites\n\nIf you've kept count, we've ruled out five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That leaves only Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla boasts the greatest upside potential based on the latest data available even after its shares more than doubled last year. The average 12-month price target for the stock is nearly 24% above the electric vehicle maker's current share price.\n\nHowever, there's a big gotcha. Tesla's shares sank last week after the company announced disappointing fourth-quarter results. Its warning of a major slowdown in sales growth in 2024 was especially worrisome. Don't be surprised if some analysts soon lower their price targets for the stock.\n\nAmazon stock vaulted 81% higher in 2023. Many on Wall Street think that it will keep the momentum going this year. The consensus price target for Amazon reflects an upside potential of nearly 16%.\n\nThere's also more of a consensus about Amazon than there is for Tesla. Of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in January who cover the stock, 43 rated it as a buy or strong buy. Only eight of the 23 analysts who cover Tesla recommended it as a buy or a strong buy. Seven analysts rated the stock as an \"underperform\" or recommended selling it.\n\nAre the analysts right?\n\nI wouldn't bet the farm that any of Wall Street's price targets will prove to be accurate. There's no way to know for sure how a given stock will perform over a 12-month period.\n\nIf I had to guess which of these stocks will beat analysts' expectations the most, I'd go with Meta. Its valuation looks relatively attractive. I won't be surprised if the company's earnings continue to grow if the economy doesn't falter.\n\nWhich \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is Wall Street most likely to be right about? Probably Amazon, in my opinion. The company's profitability and free cash flow are improving significantly. Amazon also has a big opportunity as IT spending transitions to the cloud, as do Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Nasdaq-100 Stocks With 79% to 127% Upside in 2024, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In each of the past four years, Wall Street has traded off bear and bull markets. These swings have been particularly noteworthy for the predominantly growth-focused Nasdaq-100, which comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nAfter tumbling 33% during the 2022 bear market, the innovation-powered Nasdaq-100 rallied by a jaw-dropping 54% in 2023. Such outperformance isn't lost on Wall Street's most experienced investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough Wall Street's consensus price targets often point to additional upside for industry-leading businesses, three Wall Street analysts are forecasting upside of up to 127% in 2024 for three Nasdaq-100 components.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside of 79%\n\nThe first Nasdaq-100 stock with jaw-dropping upside potential in the new year just happens to be the top megacap stock from 2023. I'm talking about semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Analyst Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities has attached a lofty $1,100 price target to shares of Nvidia, which, at its closing price of around $616 per share on Jan. 25, implies additional upside of 79%. It would also add about $1.2 trillion to Nvidia's current market cap of $1.52 trillion.\n\nIt's no secret that the buzz surrounding Nvidia involves artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the infrastructure backbone of AI-accelerated data centers. Although estimates vary, it's not out of the question that Nvidia will account for 90% or more of the share of GPUs being deployed in these high-compute data centers this year.\n\nIn addition to being the premier choice for businesses looking to lean on AI as a growth tool, Nvidia should see its production rapidly ramp up in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is meaningfully increasing its chip-of-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which will allow Nvidia to deliver more A100 and H100 chips this year. Thanks to its data center segment, Nvidia's total sales are expected to catapult from a reported $27 billion in fiscal 2023 to an estimated $93.4 billion by fiscal 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nIronically, though, Nvidia's biggest headwind in the new year might be itself. In its current fiscal year, which ends in late January 2024, A100 and H100 GPU scarcity have fueled exceptional pricing power. But as its own production increases, the company's gross margin could taper.\n\nTo add to the above, Nvidia won't be the only major fish in the pond in the current calendar year. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X GPU last year and plans to begin a full-scale rollout in 2024. Meanwhile, Intel intends to bring its Falcon Shores GPU to market next year as a direct competitor to Nvidia. Though Nvidia doesn't seem to be in danger of losing its No. 1 share ranking in AI-accelerated data centers, its market share may be plateauing.\n\nInvestors should also consider U.S. regulators' actions that could curb Nvidia's sales to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Regulators have restricted exports of AI chips on two separate occasions, which could result in billions of dollars in lost revenue each quarter for Nvidia.\n\nDespite undeniable momentum, I don't see how Mosesmann's pie-in-the-sky price target will become a reality in 2024.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery: Implied upside of 127%\n\nA second Nasdaq-100 stock offering scorching-hot upside in the current year is media company Warner Bros. Discovery(NASDAQ: WBD). Analyst Matthew Harrigan of Benchmark set a price target of $24 on the company in December, which suggests 127% upside to come.\n\nAs I noted last week, the top catalyst for Warner Bros. Discovery in 2024 is an expected bounce-back in advertising. Legacy media companies still rely on advertising for a meaningful percentage of their revenue. Uncertainties regarding U.S. growth coerced most businesses to pare back their ad budgets in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe ad driver in 2024 is the U.S. election cycle. Media investment company GroupM anticipates that U.S. political spending will jump 31% in 2024 to $15.9 billion compared to the election cycle in 2020. That's generally good news for legacy media companies.\n\nBut if Warner Bros. Discovery has any shot of catapulting higher by a triple-digit percentage in the new year, it will be because of operating improvements in its streaming segment. The clear tailwind for the company is that it possesses strong pricing power. Warner Bros. Discovery has raised prices on its subscribers with minimal losses to its paying members. Combined with purposeful cost-cutting, there's a genuine path to recurring profits for the company's direct-to-consumer segment within the next two years.\n\nOn the other hand, Warner Bros. Discovery is fighting an uphill battle against its own balance sheet. Including debt expected to be paid within the next year, the company is dealing with approximately $42.4 billion in net debt. It's not an envious position to be in, with interest rates rising at their fastest clip in four decades. It also limits Warner Bros. Discovery's ability to make deals and innovate.\n\nWhile Harrigan's price target isn't out of the question for Warner Bros. Discovery in 2024 -- shares of the company traded at this level less than two years ago -- it's not uncommon for media turnarounds to be drawn out. Though the foundation for a turnaround is there, look for Wall Street and investors to take something of a \"prove-it\" approach with the company and its stock in the new year. Cybertruck deliveries began on Nov. 30. Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla: Implied upside of 89%\n\nThe third Nasdaq-100 stock with significant upside in 2024 is none other than the largest auto company by market cap, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley recently lowered his and his firm's price target on North America's leading automaker to $345, implying an up to 89% increase is expected in 2024.\n\nThe lure of Tesla has long been its first-mover advantage. Prior to the start of 2023, it had introduced four mass-production models (3, S, X, and Y), with the Cybertruck becoming the fifth. After hitting its production target of at least 1.8 million electric vehicles (EVs) last year, Tesla has the capacity to potentially surpass 2 million EVs produced in the current year.\n\nJonas and Tesla enthusiasts are also fans of the company's recurring profits. Whereas Tesla has delivered four consecutive quarters of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, no other pure-play EV producer is within a stone's throw of reaching recurring profitability. It demonstrates just how important the company's first-mover advantages have been.\n\nIt's also worth adding that Tesla closed out 2023 with a little over $29 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. It has more than enough capital to sustain an aggressive production ramp.\n\nDespite Jonas's resounding optimism, there are quite a few reasons to believe that $345 is a pipe dream for Tesla in the new year.\n\nTo begin with, the company's price war with other EV manufacturers is clobbering its operating margin. During Tesla's May annual shareholder meeting, CEO Elon Musk pointed out that his company's pricing strategy is dictated by demand. More than a half-dozen price cuts for all production models (not including the Cybertruck) since the start of 2023 signals weaker EV demand and rising inventory levels.\n\nAnother problem for Tesla is that a substantial percentage of its pre-tax income is derived from unsustained sources. During the fourth quarter (Q4), Tesla brought in $433 million in regulatory tax credits and another $333 million from interest income earned on its cash. Approximately 35% of its $2.19 billion in Q4 pre-tax income came from non-innovative channels, which isn't what you'd expect to see from a supposed growth stock.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue with Tesla, at least in my opinion, remains its CEO. Despite successfully introducing some new innovations, Musk has a long history of delaying key projects and/or punting promised innovations. The company's valuation has many of these currently unfulfilled promises built in, and they could very easily be backed out in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The markets have continued the strong rally so far in 2024. The Nasdaq Composite is closing in on a new all-time high, while the S&P 500 is already there after rising 22% over the last 12 months.\n\nIn such a bullish year for the markets, the one opportunity that everyone is talking about is artificial intelligence (AI) and which companies are likely to benefit over the next decade. This was a key theme driving shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) higher in 2023, and two Wall Street pros see even more upside.\n\nHere's why analysts remain bullish on these two tech stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia: 76% upside\n\nNvidia is the lead supplier of chips needed for AI training, and the business has been growing like there's no tomorrow. But even after the stock's monster run last year, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann sees shares of Nvidia reaching $1,100 in the next 12 to 18 months. That is 76% higher than the current share price of $625.\n\nNvidia has long dominated the market for graphics processing units (GPUs) and is estimated to control up to 95% of the market for AI chips. GPUs have become the gold standard for training AI models and running massive supercomputers and data centers. They are fundamentally faster and operate with better energy efficiency than central processing units (CPUs).\n\nThe stock is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50 based on Wall Street's earnings estimate for the fiscal year ending in January, but that could be a lot cheaper by next year. Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings per share to increase by another 67% over the next year. That would bring Nvidia's P/E down to 30.\n\nNvidia's growth so far has been mostly fueled by the consumer internet giants and cloud service providers, but CEO Jensen Huang sees another wave of demand on the way.\n\nIn the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings report, Huang said, \"Nations and regional [cloud service providers] are investing in AI clouds to serve local demand, enterprise software companies are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms, and enterprises are creating custom AI to automate the world's largest industries.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, the AI opportunity has years to play out, as it will take time for every industry to discover ways to use AI, not to mention time for data centers to upgrade their hardware systems to handle the tremendous data workloads.\n\nI believe the stock can move higher this year, but regardless of how it performs in the near term, investors should expect Nvidia's stock price to be a lot higher in 10 years than it is today.\n\n2. Alphabet: 21% upside\n\nAnother top AI stock that Wall Street is bullish about is Google owner Alphabet. The stock returned 58% in 2023, outperforming the Nasdaq's 43% gain on the year, but Barclays analyst Ross Sandler sees the stock reaching $180 in the next 12 to 18 months, or 21% higher than the current share price of $149.\n\nThe rapid adoption of AI plays right into the hands of Google, one of the biggest investors in AI technology. It helps companies manage and run their ad campaigns on Google Search and YouTube, which gets to the heart of why investors are optimistic about the company's prospects. Advertising drives three-quarters of Alphabet's total revenue.\n\nThe company recently introduced a new AI-driven feature called Circle to Search that enables users to find information about an object in an image or video by simply highlighting it. It's a good example of how AI will grow the value of Alphabet's advertising business.\n\nSearch already brings in $44 billion in quarterly revenue for the company, and it grew 11% year over year in the 2023 third quarter, primarily driven by retail ad spending. New AI-driven search tools could lead to higher user engagement, more search queries, and more shoppable ads.\n\nThe stock trades at a forward P/E of 22. This valuation seems more than fair for the leading digital advertiser, which generated $66 billion in profit over the last year and is not done growing.\n\nGiven the importance of AI to Google's business and its ability to profit from this technology, investors should expect the stock price to hit new highs over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Within the cryptocurrency market and the wonderful world of blockchain, there are many important stocks to buy and hold that make the system work. We are not only talking about cryptocurrency projects, but there are also blockchain companies that make life in the traditional stock markets like the Nasdaq. Here you have these three blockchain stocks to buy and hold. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nRiot Platforms(RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) is one of the many important companies that make a living on the blockchain. Financially they are very well positioned. Which makes sense because they mine Bitcoin (BTC-USD). And since BTC has been doing well, so has RIOT.\n\nThey had a nice $51.9 million in total revenue, supported by a 6% increase in Bitcoin production. They mined approximately 1,106 BTC and their average mining cost was an astonishing -$6141.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut there’s more, they are working on expansion. The Corsicana facility is already up and running and the first building is expected to be operational by the end of Q1 of this year. This is part of their strategy to stay at the forefront of mining the world’s leading cryptocurrency.\n\nHIVE Digital Technologies (HIVE) HIVE Blockchain Technologies logo over a map of the world. HIVE stock.\n\nSource: karnoff / Shutterstock\n\nAnother important company that makes its living in digital asset mining is HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ:HIVE). It is not only known for its mining work, but is also very famous for its data center operations focused on sustainability and its great skill in GPU computing technology.\n\nDuring the month of December their mining work produced very good results. They produced a great figure for them of 282.8 Bitcoins. That is an incredible average of 71.6 Bitcoins per Exahash. We are talking about them contributing 1% to the global network.\n\nBut not only did they do this in December, they also contributed to their commitment to retaining digital assets with a stockpile of 1,707 BTC, which is an increase of 80 BTC over the previous month.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is much more in store for HIVE, as part of their strategic planning they decided to acquire 96 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs to keep their high performance computing and AI capabilities robust.\n\nCipher Mining (CIFR) Bitcoin miners in large farm.

Well, beyond doing a wonderful job of validating and recording Bitcoin transactions, they recently completed their installation at Odessa and added an incredible 7.2 EH/s of auto-mining capacity in four data centers.\n\nThis highlights their dedication to expanding their operation to break more and more boundaries. They smartly made the acquisition of a site in Texas, pre-approved for up to 300 MW of power consumption.\n\nNot only did they make this strategic move, but they went for more, as they made an investment by purchasing 1.2 EH/s of Bitmain S21 equipment at a reasonable $14/TH. This shows their willingness to scale mining operations and their commitment to future profitability.\n\nAnd as if the above wasn’t exciting enough, Cipher’s joint ventures closed a deal with Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN) to acquire 16,700 Avalon A1466 miners, which they plan to deliver in the second quarter of this year.\n\nAs of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The White House artificial intelligence council is meeting Monday, three months after President Joe Biden signed an executive order that aims to reduce the risks AI poses.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, who will convene the council meeting Monday, said in a statement the federal government had made significant progress in the prior 90 days on AI, saying Biden's \"directive to us is move fast and fix things.\"\n\nThe White House said nine government agencies - including Defense, Transportation, Treasury, and Health and Human Services - submitted risk assessments to the Department of Homeland Security required under Biden's order.\n\nAt the same time, efforts in Congress to pass legislation in Congress addressing AI have stalled despite numerous high-level forums and legislative proposals.\n\nOn Friday, the Biden administration said it was proposing requiring U.S. cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities are accessing U.S. data centers to train AI models through \"know your customer\" rules.\n\n\"We can't have non-state actors or China or folks who we don’t want accessing our cloud to train their models,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters Friday. \"We use export controls on chips. Those chips are in American cloud data centers so we also have to think about closing down that avenue for potential malicious activity.\"\n\nLast month, Raimondo said Commerce would not allow Nvidia \"to ship is the most sophisticated, highest-processing-power AI chips, which would enable China to train their frontier models.\"\n\nBiden's executive order invokes the Defense Production Act to require developers of AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the results of safety tests with the U.S. government before they are publicly released.\n\nThe Commerce Department plans to soon send those survey requests to companies. Raimondo told Reuters companies will have 30 days to respond.\n\n\"Any company that doesn't want to comply is a red flag for me,\" she said.\n\nTop cloud providers include Amazon.com's AWS, Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure unit.

        "title": "These AI Stocks Are Crushing the S&amp;P 500 in 2024",
        "content": "After trouncing the market averages in 2023, the stock prices of Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are continuing their momentum in 2024. AMD shares are already up 23%, while Nvidia stock is up 26% year to date -- both leaving the S&P 500 index in the dust. NVDA Chart\n\nInvestors should always be careful of paying too much for a stock, but there are good reasons to expect these top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to move higher over the next few years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nAMD is a leading supplier of central processing units (CPUs) for PCs and servers, where it is gaining market share against Intel. The company's push into high-performance computing chips has paid off in recent years, but a new year brings new opportunities for this tech innovator.\n\nAMD will try to convert its recent success in CPUs to the data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market to capture the booming market for AI.\n\nA global slowdown in the semiconductor industry pressured AMD's revenue growth over the last year. But leading chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing issued a positive outlook in its latest earnings report that bodes well for one of its key customers. TSMC manufacturers chips for other companies, including AMD, and said it expects 2024 to be a \"healthy\" year of growth.\n\nAMD has guided for $2 billion in revenue from data center GPUs this year, as it prepares to launch the new MI300 chip for AI workloads. Meta Platforms, ChatGPT owner OpenAI, and Microsoft are already in line to use the new chips this year.\n\nBut AMD is also experiencing a strong recovery in its CPU business. AMD's EPYC server chips grew revenue more than 50% quarter over quarter in 2023's Q3, while its Ryzen 7000 series CPUs for consumer PCs also posted robust growth of 46% sequentially.\n\nThe stock is more expensive than Nvidia, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47. But the combination of a recovering CPU market and growth prospects in AI GPUs are great reasons to consider buying shares for the long haul.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia\n\nThere are good reasons why Nvidia's stock price is still surging to new highs and may be the better buy. It's estimated to control around 90% share of the AI chip market, and the stock is cheaper than AMD, trading at a forward P/E ratio of just 31 based on this year's earnings estimate.\n\nNvidia has been ahead of the game for many years. Nvidia has long been a favorite brand for PC gamers, and CEO Jensen Huang was early to spot the opportunity in data centers. Over the last few decades, the company has invested over $37 billion in research and development, and that has won Nvidia the top spot in the GPU market.\n\nOther than a cheaper valuation, another reason to like Nvidia is the company's profitability. In addition to chip hardware, Nvidia also supplies networking equipment, software libraries, and development tool kits to help customers solve industry-specific problems. This is an important competitive advantage and explains why Nvidia can earn an impressive software-like profit margin of 42%, compared to AMD's history of generating lower margins. NVDA Profit Margin Chart\n\nIt's going to take time for the world's data centers to upgrade their equipment for AI processing. In a recent Instagram post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted the social media giant will be using 350,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs to build more compute infrastructure to support its future roadmap.\n\nTo put that in perspective, a single H100 costs thousands of dollars. The surging demand for these chips pushed Nvidia's data center revenue to $14.5 billion in the October-ending quarter, up from $3.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nLook for Nvidia's superior profitability and growth to lift the stock to new highs over the next few years, if not through the end of this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

        "title": "10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best performing growth stocks in January 2024. If you want to skip our take on the market as the new year officially begins, then you can take a look at the top five stocks in this list by clicking 5 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January 2024.\n\nThe start of 2024 shows that even the best of forecast and the most capable of analysts can sometimes be wrong. The first month of the new year is full of news about economic data that is setting the tone for markets and the economy for the rest of 2024. 2024 is an important year, not only because it should see interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but also because it's election year in the U.S. Elections in America affect not only Americans, as has been evident by the charged environment of recent years, but also the world since decisions made in Washington have global effects.\n\nLast year had started out with investors worrying that rapid and significant interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve would sap economic activity and tip America into a recession. However, the economic data for the fourth quarter shows that the U.S. GDP grew by 3.3% - which is far, far away from a recession and mouth watering when we consider the economic troubles of powerhouses such as Germany and China. Not only did the economy grow by 3.3% in Q4, but for the full year, growth sat at a respectable 2.5%.\n\nHowever, while economic growth is always welcomed by politicians, given the current market climate, for investors it paints a more complicated picture. This is because while a growing economy is beneficial for businesses and the stock markets, these days it also means that the Fed might be able to keep rates higher for longer. A key balance that Fed officials have to strike now that they've avoided a recession in 2023 is to start reducing rates before it's too late and keep them high enough for just the right time to make sure that inflation does not increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the economy influences investor perceptions about stocks and their future. Stocks are broadly divided into two categories, namely value stocks and growth stocks. Value stocks are those that are reasonably priced with respect to their earnings per share. These are stocks that belong to stable companies with consistent markets that are able to buffer drops in spending power during an economic downturn.\n\nOn the other end are growth stocks. These belong to companies that are operating in markets with untapped potential for revenue. The market, sensing this, prices the shares higher with respect to their earnings, and the resulting differential is captured through a price to earnings ratio. The higher this ratio (which uses either the latest twelve month, fiscal year, or forecast/estimated earnings), the more optimistic investors are about the stock's ability to grow in the future.\n\nAs it might also sound intuitive, growth stocks do well when people and businesses have money to spend. This is influenced by the economy and interest rates, both of which influence the ease with which money is available for spending. Therefore, when access to capital is cheap, there is more spending, and high growth industries such as technology end up benefiting as a result.\n\nIn fact, picking out the right growth stocks at the right time can often provide an investor with the potential to double or even triple their money. As an illustration, consider the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares are up by a whopping 1,500%+ over the past five years. So, if you'd bought $100 of stock in January 2019 - less than a year before the pandemic struck - then your small investment would be worth roughly $1,700 now. That's a big gain, and a $10,000 investment would have meant a profit of $160,000 in just five years - or equivalent to the combined average starting salary for a Master's graduate in the U.S. for two years.\n\nNVIDIA became the growth stock in 2023 as investors realized the massive potential offered by its products to train mathematical models  commonly known as artificial intelligence. A.I. is a part of the public imagination now, and since it relies on making inferences or predictions using data, its use cases are quite ubiquitous as well. Whether it's medical science, fraud detection, drug research, logistics, shipping, or even writing, A.I. models carry with them the advantage of having a treasure trove of data to use and inform decision making.\n\nCouple the investor interest in A.I. with the rosier economic conditions we're seeing at the start of 2024 and one might even start to think that growth stocks could do nothing else but grow this year. One way to see which growth stocks are worth their salt is to see their performance in 2024 so far in response to the shifting economic environment. Today we've done just this and the top growth stocks of January 2024 are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).

        "title": "Investors see Microsoft's stock market value leaving Apple behind",
        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Microsoft's early lead in artificial intelligence has the software heavyweight's stock market value poised to pull decisively ahead of Apple's over the next five years, 13 institutional investors unanimously agreed ahead of the tech titans' quarterly results this week.\n\nMicrosoft's shares have surged 7% so far in 2024, recently sending its stock market value above $3 trillion and dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company. As of Friday, the Redmond, Washington software maker's market capitalization was a few billion dollars above Apple's. Asked which would be more valuable five years from now, all 13 investments strategists and portfolio managers consulted by Reuters last week said they expect Microsoft to outpace Apple. Share prices and valuations could shift this week as Microsoft reports its quarterly results on Tuesday, followed by Apple on Thursday. In the long term, though, all the investors consulted by Reuters said Microsoft's recent successes in generative AI give it a powerful advantage over Apple.\n\nStill, the race between Apple and Microsoft could turn into a race for second place, some said, citing the huge recent gains by Nvidia, whose chips have powered the AI revolution.Microsoft made early investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and is incorporating generative AI technology across its business. AI is likely to benefit Microsoft's cloud-computing offerings as it competes with Amazon and Alphabet in that burgeoning market. In its applications business, Outlook now offers users AI help composing emails.\n\nMicrosoft \"has more levers to pull in the forms of Azure cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and of course, AI is the most compelling,\" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management. \"Apple is most reliant on the iPhone, which is a mature market, and the company has yet to detail how it will compete in the AI arms race.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has been quietly incorporating AI into product functions, such as snapping better iPhone photos, but investors will want to hear more AI plans when the company reports its December quarter results. They also will be watching China, where demand for iPhones has slumped due to a slow economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and as a resurgent Huawei erodes the Cupertino, California company's market share.\n\nApple starts sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset in the U.S. on Friday, its most expensive bet in more than a decade. Since Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007, Apple's stock has surged more than 4,300%, helping Apple eclipse Exxon Mobil in 2011 as Wall Street's most valuable company and making it a cornerstone investment of portfolio managers trying to outperform the S&P 500.\n\nWith investors worried about soft demand for iPhones in China, Apple's stock is flat so far in 2024, underperforming the S&P 500's nearly 2.5% rise as well as the 7% surge in Microsoft shares this year.\n\nMicrosoft's shares also rallied 57% rally in 2023 thanks to its lead in generative AI. Its stock is now trading at 33 times expected earnings, compared a forward PE of 28 for Apple and around 20 for the S&P 500, according to LSEG.\n\n\"These are quality growth companies ... but in order to warrant these valuations, they need to continue to grow at aggressive clips. You're going to need increases in productivity, and I think Microsoft is better poised than Apple to do so,\" said Mike Dickson, head of research at Horizon Investments.\n\nFifty Wall Street analysts recommend buying Microsoft shares, while four analysts have neutral ratings and none recommend selling, according to LSEG data. Apple has 26 positive analyst ratings and 12 neutral ratings, while two analysts recommend selling, including a downgrade to \"underweight\" by Barclays this month due to worries about \"lackluster\" iPhone sales.\n\nNvidia, now the most valuable chipmaker after its shares more than tripled last year, may also be a contender for the world's most valuable company in the next few years, said Wayne Kaufman, Chief Market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. After hitting record highs last week, Nvidia's market capitalization reached over $1.5 trillion making it Wall Street's fifth most valuable company, less than $200 billion behind Amazon. \"I have told our brokers and clients that Nvidia is like Microsoft in the early 90s and Intel in the early 80s,\" Kaufman said.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most promising green stocks according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of green stocks, the economy, and other latest news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Promising Green Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nOver the past couple of decades, the face of human civilization has changed in ways that people living just a century ago would have thought were impossible. Whether it's airplanes, cars, hospitals, or computers, the world is powered by petroleum and run by silicon - with the two resources being among the most important ones for global economic stability.\n\nYet, at the same time, progress has a cost. Fossil fuels as a source of energy are bound to emit greenhouse gasses that end up affecting the global climate. This means that even though humanity might be rapidly progressing, there might not be much left in the future as the Earth shudders under the collective weight of emissions. To counter this, companies focusing on environmentally friendly technologies are surfacing, and as a whole, these are dubbed as green stocks.\n\nGreen stocks are not a new phenomenon when it comes to the stock market. In fact, the world's largest automaker in terms of market capitalization, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), is a green company. Tesla is the first company in the world to have successfully mass produced electric vehicles and the stock market has awarded it with a lucrative valuation as a result. Its shares are up by 780% over the past five years, eclipsed only by the stock of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) that soared in 2023 in the wake of Wall Street's optimism surrounding artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, even though they promise a clean, new world, just like all other stocks, green stocks are also vulnerable to market downturns. They are vulnerable to the same set of risks that the broader growth stock category is. This category, made of risky areas such as technology stocks and biotechnology stocks, relies on a sound economy and consumer and business well being to see investor interest. This is simply because green stocks offer the promise of benefiting from their future performance; as a result, investors are vary to invest in them if the current and future economic climate is uncertain.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo naturally, the next thing to look at when it comes to talking about green stocks is the economy. As has been the case for more than a year, most of the debate in the market right now surrounds the actions of the Federal Reserve. The Fed, if you're out of the loop, has been rapidly raising interest rates for more than a year. However, these have not (yet) led to a recession as many had worried. Subsequently, the U.S. economic outlook is quite rosier in January 2024 than it was in January 2023, when everyone was just waiting for a recession to be the final nail in the coffin of bad economic news since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhen interest rates are high, green stocks struggle since they require access to generate amounts of capital to fund their growth. As an illustration, consider the performance of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. The index had last peaked in January 2021 at a reading of 2,113 points and since then it's been a downward spiral that has seen the index drop by more than half to current sit at 889 points. So what's changed since January 2021? Well, interest rates were at an all time low back then, and green stocks were dealt a pretty hefty blow by the Ukraine war which exposed the vulnerability of global energy supply chains and led governments and businesses to dump clean energy and focus on ensuring that their petroleum needs were adequately met.\n\nBefore we go ahead and see which green stocks are finding favor with analysts, one important thing to remember is that they might have a rosier future this year if the Fed brings forward interest rate cuts and reduces them earlier than markets are expecting. Since the U.S. economy is growing, lower rates would ease business conditions and make investors more comfortable with betting in favor of a green future.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the most promising green stocks according to analysts. Some notable analyst green stock picks are Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY), Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Sunnova Energy International Inc.

        "title": "These 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Hit All-Time Highs on the Same Day. Here's the Better Buy in 2024.",
        "content": "Jan. 23 ended up being a great day for the stock market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs. Three of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks closed at all-time highs as well -- Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) at $398.90 a share, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) at $598.73 a share, and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) at $385.20 per share. The other four Magnificent stocks are Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla.\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia have each set new record highs on multiple occasions already this year. But it took until Jan. 23 for Meta Platforms to exceed its previous record close of $382.18 a share that was set on Sept. 7, 2021. Making it all the more impressive for Meta is that the stock has quadrupled since it fell below $90 a share in early November 2022.\n\nStill, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Let's go through the pros and cons of these three companies to determine which has what it takes to keep the record highs coming and which is the best buy for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms: A more value-oriented Magnificent Seven stock\n\nEven after Meta Platforms' epic 15-month rally, the stock still isn't all that expensive from a valuation standpoint, which goes to show how discounted Meta was and how it should have never sold off as much as it did.\n\nNo matter how you feel about Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or any of Meta's other apps, there is no denying that the company is an absolute cash cow. In fact, Meta has the second-lowest price-to-free cash flow ratio of the Magnificent Seven. META Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nYou can think of Meta's apps as digital real estate. Meta provides some of the most affordable, effective, and measurable ad space out there. The company has done a phenomenal job improving Instagram and monetizing it, which has crushed the doubters who thought it would become irrelevant in the face of TikTok.\n\nMeta would be generating even more cash if it weren't losing billions on Reality Labs, its augmented/virtual reality segment. But that's the advantage of a company like Meta. It can afford to take risks and bleed cash without derailing the business. Very few companies are in the same position.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's a lot to like about Meta as a balanced, more value-orientated Magnificent Seven stock.\n\n2. Nvidia: Blistering growth\n\nNvidia passed $1 trillion in market cap last June and never looked back. Now it's knocking on the door of $1.5 trillion. At this rate, Nvidia could easily pass Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-most-valuable company in the world. It's just a matter of what multiple the market is willing to give it. NVDA Market Cap Chart\n\nThe biggest risk of investing in Nvidia is that so much of its future growth is priced into the stock's current valuation. At a 78.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Nvidia is far from cheap. But the growth is undeniable. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates an impressive feat from a company. In just one year, Nvidia's sales are up 66.4% and its net income has more than quadrupled. But it's Nvidia's margins that are the real standout. Generating $18.9 billion in net income on $44.9 billion in sales is almost unheard of. Nvidia makes so much profit from each dollar in sales that the company doesn't have to grow sales by that much to make its P/E ratio shrink.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Nvidia has had its downturns. The semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical. Nvidia suffered a fairly major pullback last year. Its margins were crushed, and sales and profits declined. The same thing happened in 2019.\n\nSo why are investors excited now? Well, it has to do with artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia AI accelerator processors power OpenAI's ChatGPT processors, and orders are flowing in as other companies try to hop on the AI train. \"We're at the beginning of a basically across-the-board industrial transition to generative AI to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country,\" said Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang on the company's Q3 2024 earnings call.\n\nNvidia's products have been at the forefront of many trends, including crypto mining, gaming, and professional graphics. If the growth continues, the stock could look cheap. If it slows, the stock is going to look too priced for perfection. Nvidia as a company is doing unbelievably well. Nvidia the stock is extremely expensive.\n\n3. Microsoft: A clear-cut way to capitalize on AI\n\nMicrosoft is experiencing the best parts of both Meta Platforms and Nvidia. Like Meta, Microsoft is a cash cow with a proven business model. And like Nvidia, Microsoft is investing heavily in AI and is already reaping the rewards.\n\nI think of Microsoft as the AI sandbox. It has exposure to different industries, professional services, recreational customers in gaming, applications for school, and everyday life. This sheer number of touchpoints gives Microsoft a steep advantage. It can keep its finger on the pulse of what folks are using while learning what doesn't stick.\n\nAfter all, Microsoft's history is about perfecting sticky products. Microsoft Word wasn't necessarily the best word processor. Excel wasn't the most powerful spreadsheet app. But what Microsoft did better than any other company was package these applications and make them user-friendly.\n\nMaking AI tools too complicated could push away less tech-savvy folk. Microsoft is taking a page out of its old playbook with Copilot, generative AI that is integrated into existing Microsoft applications. It basically acts as an assistant, and makes the applications more useful without making them more complicated.\n\nMicrosoft generates tons of cash that it pours into organic growth, uses to buy back its own stock, and could use to make an acquisition if it wants. Microsoft doesn't have to cross its fingers and hope its customers adopt AI. It can try out different solutions, tweak them over time, and find out what works.\n\nAdd it all up, and Microsoft has arguably the best risk/potential reward profile of any of the Magnificent Seven stocks. And for that reason, I'd buy it over Meta and Nvidia right now, although both of those picks have a lot going for them as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks Set to Join Apple and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club by 2030",
        "content": "There's been a technological shift in the major market indexes over the past two decades. For example, in 2004, General Electric and ExxonMobil reined supreme in terms of market capitalization, clocking in at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively.\n\nNow, just 20 years later, a review of the chart toppers helps illustrate the changing of the guard. Tech titans Apple and Microsoft are currently in a class by themselves, with market caps of $3 trillion each (as of Thursday morning). A review of the top 10 provides further evidence of tech's dominance, as seven of the top 10 are industry-leading technology companies.\n\nOver the past year or so, one of the biggest drivers of stock market gains has been advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The potential for widespread productivity gains is causing a stir, and accelerating adoption could boost the next cohort of \"three trillionaires.\" There are two stocks that I believe will be fueled by the growing demand for AI and join this exclusive group over the next seven years, if not sooner. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) current market cap is $1.54 trillion, so it could eventually join the $3 trillion club, though the timing is a matter of some debate. The stock would need to increase by roughly 95% from Wednesday's closing price to reach that benchmark, amounting to approximately 10% gains annually between now and 2030, which is still easily within the realm of possibility.\n\nThat's not to say there won't be challenges along the way. One of the biggest headwinds may be the stock's recent rally, as Nvidia gained 239% last year alone. However, its importance in the field of AI can't be overstated. In each of the past two quarters, the company has generated triple-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth, and management is forecasting for more of the same.\n\nNvidia serves multiple markets, each of which represents a growth opportunity. Nvidia has long held a commanding lead in the discrete desktop graphics processing unit (GPU) space, recently controlling more than 80% of the market. However, record sales during the pandemic and the subsequent downturn caused an industrywide slump. Now, after nearly three years of successive declines, GPU shipments are finally beginning to rebound, which should help drive Nvidia higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it's the combination of AI and cloud computing that could really drive the company to new heights. Nvidia has established itself as the gold standard for AI and is the go-to for helping data move through the ether -- but don't take my word for it. The company has an estimated 95% share of the GPU data center market -- which forms the foundation for cloud computing -- according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. Furthermore, Nvidia is unmatched when it comes to processors used for machine learning -- an established method used by many AI tools -- with an estimated market share of 95%, according to New Street Research. It was these credentials that made Nvidia the natural choice for accelerating generative AI.\n\nWhile estimates vary, it's clear there are trillions of dollars at stake. Analysts at Morgan Stanley suggest generative AI represents a $6 trillion opportunity, while Goldman Sachs estimates the market is worth $7 trillion. As the leading provider of AI processors, Nvidia is in the catbird seat.\n\nData centers and cloud infrastructure providers are scrambling to increase the capacity of their systems to meet the computational demands of generative AI. This trend is expected to continue for years, giving Nvidia the fuel it needs to join the $3 trillion club.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) currently has a market cap is $1.63 trillion, and many believe it's merely a matter of time before the company is admitted to the $3 trillion club. To reach that benchmark, the stock would only need to increase by roughly 85% from Wednesday's closing price. That works out to about 10% gains annually between now and 2030, a hurdle that's well within Amazon's reach.\n\nThere are numerous catalysts that could fuel the company's future growth. Decades-high inflation caused people to make difficult choices in order to make ends meet, which put a pinch on consumer spending. This, in turn, hurt Amazon's industry-leading online retail business. There are signs the economy is finally on the mend, with Amazon experiencing an 11% lift in its e-commerce sales in the first three quarters of 2023. Further improvement in the economic outlook could provide an additional boost.\n\nGlobal e-commerce sales are expected to climb more than 9% in 2024, topping $6.3 trillion. As the world's largest digital retailer, Amazon is well positioned to ride the wave of e-commerce growth.\n\nAnother growth area for the company is the digital transformation, led by cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global leader in cloud infrastructure services, with 31% of the market, according to data supplied by market analytics firm Canalys. In the face of the economic downturn, many businesses scaled back on cloud spending, but growth is returning. Spending on cloud services increased 16% in the third quarter of 2023 and is expected to accelerate further as economic conditions improve. As the industry leader, Amazon is poised to benefit from the trend.\n\nPerhaps the biggest potential growth driver for Amazon is generative AI. The technology has proven effective at summarizing emails and drafting responses, searching the internet and company storehouses for data, and even writing and debugging computer code, with new use cases being discovered every day. The result has been a mad dash to adopt these AI models. However, the cost to create these systems from scratch is prohibitive, as are the mountains of data necessary to train foundational generative AI models.\n\nAs a result, cloud providers, including AWS, are best suited to provide generative AI services to users. Amazon already offers dozens of these models and has rolled out a growing suite of tools to help its cloud customers benefit from AI.\n\nThe recovery of the e-commerce market, a rebound in cloud spending, and the growing adoption of AI should give Amazon the necessary momentum to join the $3 trillion club.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "NVDA Stock on Fire: Can Potential Nvidia Investors Still Get In or Will They Get Burned?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has started 2024 just as it finished 2023, hotter than a pistol, up 28% year-to-date and 211% over the past year. Nothing can stop it. ThinkAdvisor.com interviewed investment strategist Harry Dent Jr. about the 2024 market outlook. Dent argued that the S&P 500 could lose 86% of its value in 2024.\n\nHowever, try not to take the doom and gloom too seriously. He also suggested that January would foretell the pain ahead. Well, Nvidia’s up 28% this month, while the index has gained over 3%, a respectable number given its convincing performance in 2023. Is it too late to buy NVDA stock? I’ll look at both sides of the argument.\n\nNVDA Stock Is Past Buying\n\nWell, it is if you listen to Harry Dent. He believes the apocalypse will soon be upon us. In Dent’s defense, I saw a chart recently (I’ll be damned if I could remember where) that made a convincing case that stocks were ready for a bit of a shakeup.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn Jan. 24, Nvidia’s market cap hit $1.5 trillion for the first time. It hit $1 trillion in May 2023. With 2.47 billion shares outstanding, it can get to $2 trillion with another 33% gain. If successful, that would be a 631% gain from its October 2022 low of around $112.\n\nBased on the analyst EPS estimate for 2024 of $11.07 a share, it’s currently trading at 56x earnings. Its five-year average forward P/E is 42, so there’s no question it’s not a cheap buy right now. However, with 49 of 53 analysts rating it Overweight or Buy, anything’s possible.\n\nInvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto declared in early November that Nvidia had a high price-to-earnings ratio relative to its AI and machine learning peers. Further, he suggested NVDA stock was more expensive than 90% of its tech peers. As a result, he was near-term bearish on the stock.\n\nI don’t think there’s any doubt that Nvidia has to hit its ambitious growth targets. The average analyst estimate for revenue growth in 2024 is 119% and 58% in 2025, with 2024 and 2025 EPS of $3.34 and $12.31, respectively, for its share price to keep moving higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not a slam dunk.\n\nGreat Stocks Rarely Go out of Style\n\nIn July 2017, I wrote about why the perception Nvidia’s stock was expensive at the time — it traded at 55x its trailing earnings and 14x sales — wasn’t entirely accurate. I used McCormick & Company’s (NYSE:MKC) acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser’s (OTCMKTS:RBGLY) French’s and Frank’s Hot Sauce brands to illustrate why value is relative.\n\n“Nvidia’s fiscal 2017 free cash flow was $1.5 billion, or 22% of its annual revenue. McCormick’s free cash flow was $658 million or 15% of its annual revenue,” I wrote in 2017.\n\n“If McCormick is willing to pay seven times sales for a business that likely doesn’t generate free cash flow equal to or greater than 15% of its annual revenue, Nvidia shareholders paying 14 times sales is the price you pay to own a business that generates 50% more free cash flow relative to annual revenue.”\n\nThe most impressive part of that quote concerns free cash flow. In fiscal 2017, it was $1.5 billion. Bank of America recently highlighted that Nvidia should be able to generate $100 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, more than 3x what it generated over the past two and 56x what it did seven years ago.\n\n“Of the ~$100 billion [of] free cash flow, we estimate only ~$30 to $35 billion could be deployed for buybacks, leaving a meaningful $65 to $70 billion in ammunition for new organic and inorganic growth initiatives,” Business Insider reported BofA analyst Vivek Arya’s comments from a Jan. 4 note to clients.\n\nWhile there’s no question we are in the early innings of AI, and the leadership positions could change over time, I don’t think there’s any doubt that it’s Nvidia’s game to lose.\n\nUntil someone can show they’re up to the challenge of toppling the company from the top of the AI mountain, its stock seems destined to keep moving higher.\n\nI believe it’s still a buy.\n\nHowever, pick up half a position now, and the other half should it correct into the low $500s or high $400s.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Trump vs. Biden: How the 2024 election could affect Exxon, Nvidia, and other stocks",
        "content": "A likely Biden-Trump rematch is top of mind for investors, as former president Donald Trump moves closer to clinching the GOP nomination.\n\nFor investors, history suggests a strong pre-election year will carry over into the following year. Analysis from Carson Group’s Ryan Detrick found the S&P 500 has recorded gains every election year after a 20%-plus gain in the pre-election year.\n\nAnd while history shows stocks usually go up regardless of which party is in the White House, analysis from Goldman Sachs found that tech is usually the worst performing sector in the year leading up to the general election, while utilities and consumer staples tend to outperform.\n\nIn the near term, President Biden’s green energy push, crackdown on fossil fuels, and escalating tech war with China are among top issues for investors. For Trump, the former president’s trade agenda, along with his pledge to \"drill baby, drill,\" have different implications for stock portfolios.\n\nRecord profits for big oil\n\nEnergy policy will likely be a priority for both side of the aisle in November.\n\nThough critics of Biden’s renewable energy push argue he's waged a war on fossil fuels, the sector has performed quite well under the current administration. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) have reported record profits, and US oil production has hit record levels.\n\nBut Trump’s campaign promise to deregulate energy production and abolish current renewable energy subsidies will be another boon to the oil industry, according to Keith Bliss, global head of markets and strategy for BloxCross.\n\n\"Big oil will be able to export as much as possible to new markets,\" Bliss told Yahoo Finance. \"When you sum up the reduction in cost, the access to new markets, the reduction in regulation costs, and the ability to produce additional products with increased feedstock, then Big Oil will make even more money.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Bliss warns oil giants will \"struggle\" if President Biden is re-elected, arguing the administration will likely become \"more aggressive.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCrackdown on China\n\nNo matter who wins, some industries will be facing an uphill battle.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden’s aggressive stances towards China have the potential to \"rattle investors and corporate decision makers,\" warned China Beige Book’s Shehzad Qazi.\n\n\"I think we're going to see a lot of aggressive maneuvers on the China front,\" Qazi told Yahoo Finance.\n\nTrump’s decision to target China with tariffs as high as 25% during his first term put investors on edge, while Biden's initiatives to crack down on China’s technological advancements placed chip giants in the crosshairs.\n\nPortfolio Wealth Advisors president Lee Munson warns that while neither candidate is good news for chipmakers like Nvidia, Trump could pose a bigger risk.\n\n\"Biden has not been friendly to China, but Trump's going to be even worse,\" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. \"When you look at Trump, he's mercurial and could just cut off the tap…. And tell Nvidia they can’t sell anything.\"\n\nA total ban could be a massive hit to American chip giants. China accounted for about one-third of the sector’s global sales in 2023, with AI leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) generating at least 20% of their revenue from the country.\n\n\"Companies that rely on China for sales or for supply chains are going to have to adapt,\" Munson added.\n\nAutomakers struggle with EV costs\n\nSince Biden took office, electric vehicles sales have more than quadrupled, as automakers jumped on board with the administration's ambitious EV-sales goals. But the transition is proving costly for traditional automakers.\n\nFord (F) recorded a $1.3 billion loss in its EV division in its most recent quarter; General Motors (GM) is also losing money on its EVs.\n\n\"They haven't figured out the EV market yet, and if Biden comes back in, the government will keep pushing the EV story,\" Bliss said. \"The Big Three could continue to struggle.\"\n\nHigher manufacturing costs have driven up EVs' price tags, making affordability an issue. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that the company needs to lower their costs to succeed.\n\n\"We're seeing mainstream customers who are interested in EVs, but they're not convinced, and they're not going to pay a big premium,\" Farley said. \"So what it means for the [manufacturers] is cost — we have to dramatically reduce the cost.\"\n\nTrump targets ESG\n\nInvestments that take into account environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have become a top target for Republicans ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nTrump has been vocal about his opposition to ESG initiatives in the past, promising to support \"a law to keep politics away from Americans’ retirement accounts forever.\"\n\nDuring the final months of his term, he pushed to discourage employers from considering ESG issues for retirement plans, a rule later reversed by Biden.\n\nThe increased skepticism and scrutiny of sustainable funds from politicians and regulators has had a chilling effect on fund flows. Investors pulled a total of $13 billion from US sustainable funds in 2023, the worst year on record according to Morningstar's data.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 2 Superb AI Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Investing in stocks can be tricky, as the market's past performance isn't always indicative of what's to come. However, knowledge is power, and noticing past trends and patterns can help ensure you're ready to strike if history decides to repeat itself. As a result, it can only help investors to know that history suggests the Nasdaq Composite could surge in 2024.\n\nSince the index launched in 1971, it has risen by an average of 19% in each year that followed a market recovery of the magnitude you saw in 2023. Consequently, it's not a bad idea to consider investing in the companies fueling the bulk of the Nasdaq Composite's growth.\n\nA boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) space last year was instrumental in driving the market's recovery and will likely continue to propel big gains in 2024. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are two attractive options for investors looking to profit from the rise of the AI industry.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nEven the most casual of investors is probably aware of Nvidia's meteoric rise last year. Its stock soared by 239% in 2023 as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for hardware for AI developers worldwide. These high-powered parallel-processing chips are crucial for training and powering AI models.\n\nAs interest in AI skyrocketed, so did demand for GPUs, and Nvidia was positioned to supply hardware to a market where demand exceeded supply. The company achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI chips and its earnings soared even as rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel scrambled to catch up on the technology front.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended Oct. 29, Nvidia's revenue rose 206% year over year while operating income soared by 1,600%. The spike in its AI GPU sales drove its data center revenue 279% higher.\n\nCompetition in the AI chip space is expected to heat up this year, with AMD, Intel, and even Amazon bringing powerful new hardware to market. However, trends in the chip sector suggest Nvidia's dominance will be a tough nut to crack.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel was the king of central processing units (CPUs) for years, with an 82% market share at the start of 2017. It was then that AMD began a serious push into that niche with the debut of its Ryzen line of CPUs. AMD has managed to draw a significant share of the market away from Intel since then. However, Intel still holds a market share above 60% in CPUs, with AMD's share at 35%. If that pattern is any indication of what's to come in AI, Nvidia could retain its leadership spot in GPUs for years.\n\nNvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 49 makes it look like an expensive stock right now. However, its forward earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates illustrate why its stock remains a buy. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nNvidia's earnings could reach $24 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's current forward P/E of 49 yields a stock price of $1,176, projecting stock growth of 96% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nGranted, it's a lofty target. Nvidia's stellar business growth may slow down in coming years, lowering the P/E-based price target in the process. However, it's based on reasonable financial forecasts. Nvidia's stock is a screaming buy in 2024 if you expect it to get anywhere near these growth targets.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nWith a market capitalization of $2.9 trillion, Microsoft is the world's second-most valuable company and one of the biggest growth drivers in the Nasdaq Composite index. Thanks to potent products like Windows, Office, Azure, Xbox, and LinkedIn, the company has become a tech behemoth with the brand power and financial resources to succeed in almost any arena.\n\nMicrosoft emerged as one of the biggest players in AI last year when it boosted its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Their partnership has granted Microsoft exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI models, which it has used to make upgrades across its product lineup.\n\nOver the past year, elements of ChatGPT have been integrated into Microsoft's search engine, Bing, a range of new AI tools have been added to its cloud platform Azure, and its various Office applications now offer improved productivity.\n\nExcitement over Microsoft's prospects in AI has helped propel its stock upward by 65% in the last 12 months, and it shows no signs of slowing. MSFT EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nAs the chart above shows, Microsoft's earnings are forecast to reach $15 per share over the next two fiscal years. Using a calculation similar to the one we did for Nvidia and multiplying that EPS figure by Microsoft's current forward P/E of 35 yields a stock price of $525. Again, I'm looking at bullish growth projections here but Microsoft may very well meet these lofty goals.\n\nBased on its current position, projections indicate Microsoft's stock could soar by 33% in two years. Like Nvidia, Microsoft looks like a no-brainer buy this year and an attractive way to invest in AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Will Lead the New Bull Market",
        "content": "It's official: A new bull market is here. And part of the reason for that is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis roundtable panel of Motley Fool contributors agrees that AI stocks will lead this new bull market. But will the AI stocks that led the market out of the doldrums and toward the recent highs be the same stocks that will carry the bull market forward? Or will new AI stocks emerge as market leaders? See why Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are top picks now. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nAmazon stands to benefit from the growth of AI\n\nJake Lerch (Amazon): I think 2024 will see a massive transformation for AI, and that's why I'm picking Amazon as the AI stock that will lead this new bull market.\n\nIn short, the commercialization of AI is just starting. Relatively few AI products are available right now, but that's changing rapidly. Microsoft is now offering AI-powered Copilot features in its Office software, CrowdStrike's security modules utilize machine learning to prevent hacking, and Adobe has several multimedia tools that use generative AI. Countless other AI-driven products will soon be available for retail and enterprise customers.\n\nAmazon, the world's largest cloud services provider and the world's largest e-commerce company, should benefit in several ways:\n\nCloud spending could accelerate as businesses ramp up spending on generative AI, which runs on the cloud. And, crucially, cloud spending is one of Amazon's fastest-growing revenue sources. E-commerce spending could get a boost from the rise of AI-driven digital marketing, known as programmatic advertising, which helps advertisers serve better and more targeted ads. More e-commerce spending should lead to higher revenue for Amazon. Robotics innovations could lead to massive cost savings. Amazon is already America's second-largest employer, with over 1.5 million employees. However, it already uses over 750,000 robots in its sprawling warehouse network. Expect more robots -- run by AI -- going forward; that could lead to higher profits for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's enormous scale -- and the diversified nature of its business model (primarily split between e-commerce and the cloud) -- means the company will capture additional revenue as AI technology matures. Moreover, the company's own AI innovations and outside robotics advancements could help the company become more efficient, meaning bigger profits for the company and bigger returns for Amazon shareholders.\n\nThis stock is up over 300% and could continue to soar\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): The social media giant and AI innovator is an obvious pick to lead the new bull market because it's already doing it. The stock bottomed at roughly $90, along with the broader market, in late 2022. It's rallied over 300% since then.\n\nRemarkably, Meta Platforms is arguably still undervalued today. The company found itself in Wall Street's dog house when advertising struggles amid iPhone software changes and frivolous spending cratered Meta's free cash flow between mid-2022 and early 2023. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThe remedy? CEO Mark Zuckerberg aggressively cut expenses and leaned in to AI to counter Meta's iPhone privacy headwinds and get the company's financials back on track. Now, analysts are optimistic again about Meta's future, estimating a 20% long-term average annual earnings growth rate.\n\nThat's an enticing 1.1 PEG ratio, based on the stock's forward P/E of only 22. In other words, Meta's stock was so beaten down at its low that shares are still a bargain despite their meteoric rebound.\n\nAs long as Meta continues performing and can meet analyst estimates, the stock is poised to help lead this new bull market.\n\nInvestors should not forget the AI chip leader\n\nWill Healy(Nvidia): When it comes to AI stocks, one might think they missed out on Nvidia. The semiconductor stock rose by almost 240% in 2023, and with it rising an additional 25% so far in 2024, one might assume its run will plateau in the near future.\n\nDon't be so sure.\n\nAI-capable chips are essential to supporting the technology, and late last year, a Raymond James analyst estimated Nvidia controlled more than 85% of the generative AI accelerator chip market. Admittedly, that success has attracted competitors. Companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have taken notice and seek to take away some of that business with their own lines of AI chips.\n\nNonetheless, with Nvidia's market lead, these companies will probably struggle to challenge its dominance in the near term. Moreover, Allied Market Research estimates a 38% compound annual growth rate in the AI chip market through 2030.\n\nSuch a growth rate makes it easier for Nvidia to shrug off any potential competition, and seems to reinforce the optimism. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29), the company reported $39 billion in revenue, an 86% increase versus year-ago levels.\n\nOver the same time frame, net income exceeded $17 billion, a huge increase from the $3 billion it earned during the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nAdditionally, analysts forecast revenue will grow at 119% during the current fiscal year. Although it is likely to slow down, they predict revenue will rise by an additional 57% in fiscal 2025, indicating the rapid increases will continue.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to the surge in net income, Nvidia's valuation has fallen significantly. Its P/E ratio had exceeded 240 as recently as July. Today, the earnings multiple stands at 81, and its forward P/E ratio has fallen to 50.\n\nAs long as net income continues to skyrocket, these multiples will likely decline further, making the burgeoning AI-driven opportunity in Nvidia stock a much safer choice.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Simple Reason Why Nvidia Stock Could Keep Crushing the Market",
        "content": "It is no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) has supercharged Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) in recent quarters, triggering eye-popping growth in the company's revenue and earnings as tech giants race to get their hands on its graphics processing units (GPUs) for training and powering AI models.\n\nThis explains why buyers face wait times of 36 weeks to 52 weeks to get delivery of Nvidia's AI-focused A100 and H100 processors. But it is worth noting that the semiconductor specialist is looking to aggressively increase production of its AI GPUs, which is why customers such as Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) are expecting to get their hands on much larger numbers of those chips this year.\n\nAccording to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant expects its arsenal of Nvidia's flagship H100 graphics cards to hit 350,000 units by the end of 2024. Market research firm Omdia estimates that Meta received 150,000 H100s in 2023. If that estimate is accurate, Zuckerberg's remarks indicate that Meta expects to receive an additional 200,000 units of this processor in 2024.\n\nThat would be a 33% increase over last year. This indicates Nvidia's capacity expansion efforts are likely to drive stronger growth for the company this year, which may be enough to help it outperform Wall Street's expectations.\n\nNvidia is consistently raising its AI GPU capacity\n\nOmdia estimates that Nvidia sold an estimated 500,000 of its flagship H100 AI graphics cards in 2023's third quarter. That was an impressive 67% improvement over the estimated shipments of 300,000 H100 GPUs in the second quarter.\n\nThe market research firm forecast that shipments of Nvidia's H100 processors would exceed 500,000 units in the final quarter of 2023. That won't be surprising, as its foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) (popularly known as TSMC), has been boosting its advanced chip packaging capacity so that it can produce greater quantities of Nvidia's AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC reportedly increased its advanced chip packaging capacity by an estimated 25% to 66% in 2023 to a range of 15,000 to 20,000 wafers per month. It was earlier manufacturing 12,000 wafers a month. With Nvidia reportedly making use of 60% of the Taiwan-based foundry giant's capacity, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia shipping more than 500,000 units of the H100 in Q4 2023.\n\nAssuming the company ships 600,000 H100 processors in Q4 (a 20% increase over the Q3 number), its total shipments of this chip in the final three quarters of 2023 would land at 1.4 million units. Given that Nvidia started shipping the H100 in the first quarter of 2023, we can assume that it may have ended the year with shipments of 1.5 million units. That's nearly triple what some were expecting the company to ship last year.\n\nThis explains why Nvidia has been comprehensively beating Wall Street's earnings estimates over the past couple of quarters. In the second quarter of its fiscal 2024, Nvidia delivered $2.70 per share in adjusted earnings, topping analysts' consensus estimate of $2.09 per share. This was followed by $4.02 per share in adjusted earnings in its fiscal third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), significantly exceeding the analysts' $3.37 per share estimate.\n\nThese impressive earnings beats help explain why Nvidia stock has surged by 233% in the past year. And it could continue to deliver stronger bottom-line growth given the capacity expansions of its foundry partner.\n\nNvidia's shipment capacity could continue increasing in 2024\n\nTSMC is expected to boost its advanced chip packaging capacity to 30,000 wafers a month in the second quarter. According to other estimates, the foundry giant could end the year with a capacity of 35,000 wafers a month. So TSMC is likely to more than double its capacity for manufacturing AI chips in 2024. That's why we can assume that Nvidia could witness a significant increase in its revenue and earnings in its new fiscal year, which begins next month.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia's revenue to increase by 57% in fiscal 2025 to $93 billion. Its earnings are expected to jump 67% to $20.56 per share. For comparison, they predict that Nvidia will close out fiscal 2024 with revenue of $59 billion, a 118% increase over the prior year. Its bottom line is forecast to increase by a whopping 268% to $12.30 per share.\n\nIf TSMC indeed doubles its output and Nvidia continues to absorb 60% of the foundry giant's advanced packaging capacity, it won't be surprising to see the graphics specialist repeat its fiscal 2024 performance and blow away Wall Street's expectations. That's why investors would do well to buy Nvidia right away, considering that it is trading at just 29 times forward earnings, a nice discount to its five-year forward earnings multiple of 42.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The year 2023 was quite impressive for the U.S. stock market, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes posting returns of 24% and 43%, respectively. A major part of this bull rally can be attributed to the strong performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and other related stocks.\n\nAI is far more than a passing trend and marks a transformational technology in today's world. Its relevance as a major investment theme persists in 2024.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, here's why high-quality AI-powered stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), and UiPath (NYSE: PATH) can prove to be smart buys in 2024.\n\nNvidia\n\nAn undisputed leader in the AI market, Nvidia's GPUs, CPUs, networking technologies, and software offerings are being used extensively by data centers to upgrade their infrastructure for AI workloads.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang expects data centers to spend nearly $1 trillion in capital expenditures for transitioning from CPU-based infrastructure to GPU-based infrastructure, necessary for high-performance computing, machine learning, and AI workloads. Nvidia seems positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, with cutting-edge AI chips and a Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software stack used by nearly 4 million developers to optimally program these chips. The company also accelerated the pace of new data center chip architecture releases from every two years to annually.\n\nAfter a lackluster performance in the past few quarters, Nvidia is seeing strength in the gaming business driven by the availability of Nvidia RTX retracing and AI technologies at low price points. The increasing prevalence of esports is also a major growth driver for the company's gaming chips.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, despite trading at 34 times trailing 12-month sales, Nvidia's strong position in the AI market makes it a potentially wise investment choice in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer, excelling in high-end server and storage systems, benefited dramatically from the increasing demand for its AI platforms, especially the large language model (LLM)-optimized HGX-H100 solutions (which contain multiple H100 chips interconnected with cutting-edge networking technologies). Many hyperscalers and cloud service providers also demand direct-attached cold-plate liquid-cooling solutions with the server systems to address the high power costs and thermal challenges associated with deploying power-hungry AI workloads. The company's modular, energy-efficient, and scalable solutions helped set it apart from competitors focused on mass-producing servers.\n\nSupermicro's collaborations with major chip players such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel further ensured early access to advanced AI chips, giving the company a distinct competitive advantage. By sending solutions earlier to customers, Super Micro helps customers to make decisions earlier -- translating into incremental revenue opportunities for the company. All these positives make Supermicro a compelling pick for 2024.\n\nSnowflake\n\nSnowflake, a cloud-native data platform, helps multiple organizations such as Salesforce, ServiceNow,Workday, and SAP manage, store, and analyze vast amounts of structured and unstructured data from a wide range of diverse sources and formats. This capability plays a major role in giving organizations a comprehensive view of the data landscape and running complex AI algorithms and models.\n\nA key advantage for Snowflake is its ability to process unstructured and streaming data. Over 30% of its customer base is working with unstructured data, leading to a 17 times increase in unstructured data consumption year over year in October 2023. A new data streaming feature, Dynamic Tables, already attracted 1,500 customers, with more expected to adopt it in the coming months. Furthermore, Snowflake's data marketplace, a major part of its data cloud platform, allows organizations to access and share data sets, thereby enriching their own data with additional insights and context. This further improves the outcomes of their AI models. The data-sharing feature created a strong network effect and a sticky customer base -- which are major positives in the current uncertain economic environment.\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nShares of data analytics company Palantir surged an impressive 167% in 2023, a marked recovery from the 65% decline in 2022. The company's platform is well known for its exceptional ability to analyze large data sets for government and commercial clients utilizing advanced AI and machine learning algorithms.\n\nRecently, Palantir launched an innovative Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) that combines its core machine learning capabilities with the power of advanced large language models, allowing customers to improve productivity and operational efficiency. The company also launched an innovative go-to-market strategy called AIP Bootcamp, which allows clients to test its platforms with real workflows in five or fewer days. A significant change from the traditional pilot strategy, AIP Bootcamps allow for faster negotiation and customer wins.\n\nPalantir is already positive according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),  a solid strength for a high-growth company. This is why the company seems to be a smart buy now.\n\nUiPath\n\nLeading robotic process automation player UiPath helps businesses automate routine and mundane tasks, thereby helping them improve enterprise productivity and cost efficiencies. The company is also leveraging AI technologies to drive automation for even more complex and nuanced tasks.\n\nUiPath's focus on industry verticalization, or developing tailored automation solutions for specific industries, has been a key competitive strength. The company invests in playbooks, marketing events, and enablement programs to help its support teams better understand the unique needs and challenges of various industries, helping them deliver targeted solutions to their customers. All this has translated into a rapid expansion in the customer base and a successful cross-selling strategy. With a portfolio of innovative offerings and a robust marketing strategy, UiPath may prove to be an intriguing investment for 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Better AI Buy: Nvidia vs Amazon",
        "content": "Everybody's talking about artificial intelligence (AI) these days -- and for good reason. The technology has the potential to change the world, from improving safety in cars to bringing better drugs to market faster. AI also can make businesses more efficient, reducing costs and boosting earnings. Further, the AI market, expanding at a 21% compound annual growth rate, is set to reach more than $2 trillion by 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights.\n\nSo, it's no surprise companies are investing in this hot technology -- and investors are hoping to get in on tomorrow's AI winners today. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently have jumped into the AI spotlight, representing promising AI bets.\n\nNvidia makes the chips that power the technology, and Amazon uses AI to improve its operations and serve its customers. Their shares have climbed 218% and 62%, respectively, over the past year, but these market giants still have room to run. If you could pick up only one of these stocks today, which makes the better AI buy? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long powered the worlds of gaming and graphics. But these chips' ability to divide work among processors and carry out several tasks at the same time -- leading to tremendous speed -- soon launched them into a broad range of applications across industries. And one of those areas is AI.\n\nThanks to Nvidia's top chip performance, the company holds more than 80% of the AI chip market, according to analysts. Sure, rivals -- such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) -- exist. But Nvidia could stay ahead for several reasons. The company already is a leader, so satisfied customers may not be eager to switch to another chipmaker. We've seen this trend already among chip customers in the world of central processing units -- AMD has been unable to unseat Intel over the years.\n\nFinally, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels and instead significantly invests in research and development (R&D) to stay ahead of the competition and continue innovating. In the most recent quarter (period ended Oct. 29), Nvidia's  R&D spending increased 18% to more than $2.2 billion. At the same time, the company's operating income outpaced operating expenses, and net income surged more than 1,000% year over year. So Nvidia can afford to continue investing to stay on top while delivering earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nAmazon has invested in AI for its own use and to serve its customers. The e-commerce giant uses AI to streamline operations at its fulfillment centers and to design the most efficient delivery routes for packages, for example. These and other ways of using AI help Amazon reduce costs, therefore boosting earnings.\n\nThe e-commerce business also uses AI to help a customer find the right item by generating suggestions based on what they've bought in the past -- that could keep them coming back, again adding to Amazon's earnings potential.\n\nAI also is a big part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing business. AWS offers various AI tools to clients so they don't have to build from the ground up or manage infrastructure.\n\nAmazon has made itself present in every layer of AI. It's created chips, such as the Trainium, to train large language models (LLM). It's launched an LLM service, Amazon Bedrock, which features top foundation models that customers can customize for their own use. And AWS offers applications that run the LLMs such as Code Whisperer, a coding assistant for developers.\n\nIn Amazon's most recent earnings call, the company said generative AI remains a priority for AWS customers -- and AWS, as the cloud market leader, is in the perfect position to benefit.\n\nNvidia or Amazon?\n\nNvidia and Amazon both are set for success in the world of AI. Both companies also are profitable and have a solid track record of revenue growth. NVDA Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nBut if I had to choose the biggest AI winner, I would go for Nvidia. That's because the company dominates in a key area: It powers AI training, the \"deep learning\" that will give those AI models the ability to perform. Nvidia is an expert in GPUs, already is a step ahead of rivals, and has the financial situation to invest in R&D to maintain its leadership.\n\nToday, Nvidia trades for 50x forward earnings estimates, compared to 43x for Amazon, but the tech giant is worth the premium -- making it the top AI stock to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "1 Monster AI Growth Stock Up 31,400% Since 2000 to Buy Now and Hold Long-Term",
        "content": "Accelerated computing company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year. Its share price rocketed 239% as investors positioned their portfolios around artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. But that fantastic performance was merely the most recent chapter in a longer growth story still being written.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market is expected to compound at 37% annually to approach $2 trillion by 2030, and Nvidia has positioned itself as a major beneficiary. In fact, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino recently told Business Insider that \"Nvidia is clearly going to be the biggest winner\" as that opportunity unfolds.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nHere's how much Nvidia stock returned in each year since 2000\n\nNvidia stock gained over 31,400% over the last 24 years, compounding at 27.4% annually. To put that in context, $10,000 invested in the company in January 2000 would be worth about $3.1 million today.\n\nThe chart below shows how much Nvidia's stock price increased (or decreased) in each year between 2000 and 2023. Data source: Macrotrends, YCharts. Shown above is the annual return in Nvidia stock in each year between 2000 and 2023. Returns have been rounded to the nearest whole percentage point.\n\nIn 1999, Nvidia invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), bringing revolutionary visual effects to the gaming and multimedia markets. Those chips have become the gold standard in video game graphics and professional visualization. Nvidia holds more than 95% of the market in workstation graphics processors, and its chips were used to create every film that received an Academy Award nomination for best visual effects in the last 15 years.\n\nIn 2006, Nvidia introduced its CUDA programming model. That innovation turned its GPUs into general purpose processors and paved the way for data center dominance. Nvidia GPUs are now the gold standard in accelerating data center workloads like AI, data science, and scientific computing. In fact, the company holds about 95% market share in data center GPUs, and it holds 80% to 95% market share in AI chips.\n\nNvidia has further expanded its data center footprint by branching into adjacent hardware markets. It acquired high-performance networking company Mellanox in 2019, and it took aim at Intel and Advanced Micro Devices by launching a central processing unit (CPU) in 2023. The InfiniBand and Spectrum-X networking platforms and Grace CPUs are purpose-built for AI, and the company has already seen strong traction across those product lines. Specifically, networking is a $10 billion business, and CPUs are on pace to be a multibillion-dollar business in the near future, according to management.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2021, Nvidia branched into subscription software with AI Enterprise, a platform that simplifies the development and deployment of AI applications across various disciplines. The software suite includes frameworks that streamline the creation of recommender systems for retail, intelligent avatars for customer service, and computer vision systems for autonomous machines in logistics and manufacturing.\n\nIn 2023, the company delved into cloud services with Omniverse Cloud and DGX Cloud. Those platforms bring together supercomputing infrastructure, software, and pretrained machine learning models to support the development of 3D, AI, and robotics applications. Additionally, Nvidia recently announced foundry services that lean on DGX Cloud to help businesses customize large language models and build generative AI applications for text, images, videos, and drug discovery.\n\nIn short, Nvidia has evolved from a GPU company into a full-stack data center computing company focused on graphics and AI. Its ability to provide solutions across infrastructure, software, and services further cements its leadership in those markets. To quote Zino, \"We believe ... [Nvidia's] full-stack AI/software capabilities provide an incredible competitive moat.\"\n\nNvidia reported phenomenal financial results in the third quarter\n\nNvidia looked untouchable in the third quarter. Revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion on record sales in the data center segment, as well as strong momentum in gaming and professional visualization. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (adjusted) net income increased 588% to $10 billion as high-margin software and services accounted for more of total revenue.\n\nThe graphic below shows revenue across each business segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29, 2023). Chart by Author. Shown above is the third-quarter revenue from Nvidia's four primary business segments. Revenue from the OEM & Other segment has been excluded because it represents less than one percent of total revenue.\n\nNvidia stock trades at a reasonable price\n\nAs mentioned, AI spending across hardware, software, and services is forecast to increase at 37% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, the graphics processor market is expected to expand at roughly 28% annually during the same period. Nvidia is exceptionally well positioned to monetize both tailwinds, perhaps more so than any other company.\n\nIn any case, Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow sales at 40% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 23.6 times sales appear quite reasonable. Patient investors with a five-year time horizon should feel comfortable buying a small position in Nvidia stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "After a year of spectacular gains, the stock market seems to be taking a breather to kick off the new year. Investors are justifiably cautious after the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) notched gains of 43% last year. Given those stellar gains, investors are left to wonder if the current rally still has legs -- and history can help provide some guidance.\n\nGoing back to 1972 -- the first full year the tech-centric index traded -- in every year following a bear market rebound, the Nasdaq has rallied another 19%, on average. The results varied by year, of course, ranging from a 7% increase in 1986 to a 38% surge in 2013. That said, and given the ongoing economic recovery, chances are good that the current market rally will continue in 2024.\n\nThere's evidence that suggests it was the emergence of generative AI that fueled the market surge last year. These advanced algorithms were deployed to handle menial tasks, freeing the user for higher-level chores. While it's still early innings for AI, there are a couple of companies that stand out from the pack and are well-positioned to profit from the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI stock No. 1: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is arguably a household name, best known for its pervasive Windows PC operating system and Office suite of productivity tools.\n\nSeeing the vast potential for generative AI, Microsoft dove in headfirst, taking a $13 billion stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. More importantly, the company quickly developed Copilot, an AI-powered assistant designed to make its software users more productive by streamlining repetitive, time-consuming tasks.\n\nEven before it was released for general availability, the company experienced a surge in demand during its \"pilot\" project, with 40% of the Fortune 100 using Microsoft 365 Copilot during the company's early access program. Microsoft reported strong interest in the digital assistant, which was made generally available in November.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe increased demand is already having a halo effect on Azure Cloud, which swept past its rivals as the fastest-growing of the major cloud infrastructure providers in the calendar third quarter. Lest there was any doubt why, Microsoft said three percentage points of Azure's growth was for \"AI services.\"\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), Microsoft's revenue grew 13% year over year, while EPS climbed 27%, even before the impact of Copilot. Add to that improving macroeconomic conditions, the ongoing adoption of cloud computing, and tailwinds from AI, and 2024 should be a very good year for Microsoft.\n\nFor all that opportunity, the stock is selling for 36 times forward earnings. While that's a slight premium to the overall market, given its track record, Microsoft is worth every penny.\n\nAI stock No. 2: Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) didn't start out to be the AI processor to the stars. The company made its bones by pioneering the graphics processing units (GPUs) that display lifelike images in video games. However, CEO Jensen Huang realized early on that its graphics cards could be adapted to a variety of uses that required a degree of computational horsepower, including data centers, cloud computing, and AI.\n\nThat strategy has been so successful that Nvidia's data center segment -- which includes processors used for AI -- has surpassed the revenue generated by gaming chips. During the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), data center revenue represented 80% of Nvidia's sales, up from 41% two years earlier. During that same period, revenue for the segment surged 350%, helping illustrate the soaring demand for AI processors.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia is already the gold standard for processors used in data centers, with a 95% market share, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino. Furthermore, Nvidia controls 95% of the machine learning GPU market, according to New Street Research. With demand for AI processing kicking into high gear, data centers are scrambling to upgrade their systems to meet the rigorous demands of AI -- which spells more good news for Nvidia.\n\nThe available evidence seems to support that idea. In the third quarter, Nvidia delivered record revenue that soared 206% year over year to $18.1 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share that surged 1,274% to $3.71. To be fair, easy comps related to the downturn skew the results, but the trajectory is clear.\n\nDespite the company's impressive performance and the massive opportunity ahead, Nvidia still trades for a reasonable price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Machine learning, which allows computers to copy how humans learn and adapt, is nothing new. The term was first coined back in 1959 by computer scientist Arthur Samuel, who created the first machine learning system – the Samuel Checkers-playing Program. Now, far more advanced, machine learning is doing far more than playing checkers, creating a big opportunity for machine learning stocks.\n\nNowadays, machine learning involves showing data to a machine so it can learn and even make predictions – like a human – with things such as facial recognition, product recommendations, financial accuracy, predictive analytics, medical diagnoses, and speech recognition to name a few. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for example uses machine learning to provide you with recommended shows.\n\nBetter, “As these technologies continue to advance and mature, they are expected to have a transformative impact on various industries, shaping the way businesses operate, make decisions, and deliver value to customers,” added Grand View Research.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, machine learning could be worth $528.1 billion by 2030 from $204.3 billion today, according to Statista. All of which could create substantial opportunities for machine learning stocks, such as the following three.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the most explosive tech stocks on the market. Since Jan. 1, it raced from a low of about $137 to $178.29, and it could easily see higher highs. All thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).\n\nFor one, AMD’s RDNA 3 GPU architecture “includes upgraded machine learning accelerators that are more than twice as fast as its previous-generation technology,” as noted by SiliconANGLE.\n\nTwo, the company is seeing massive demand for AI chips. According to Barclays, which just raised its AMD price target to $200 from $120, says AMD could see $4 billion in AI chip sales just this year. TD Cowen also increased its price target on AMD to $185 from $130, with an outperform rating. Then, Wedbush reiterated its outperform rating on AMD, with a $200 price target. New Street Research also piled on, with a buy rating and a $215 price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nMachine Learning Stocks:Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the top machine learning stocks to buy, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) designs programs that rely on machine learning to help customers make better decisions and forecasts.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense, for example, awarded PLTR a $250 million contact to conduct research in AI/ML for the U.S. Army. All as “Interest in AI and ML in the defense world has exploded in recent years, with military officials lauding their potential battlefield applications and industry matching the energy,” as noted by C4ISRNET.\n\nPLTR also partnered with the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to create the Center for Linkage and Acquisition of Data, which is part of the National Institutes of Health’s All of Us Research Program. All to gain a better understanding of the drivers of health and disease, according to the press release.\n\nEarnings haven’t been too shabby either. In its most recent quarter, the company posted revenue of $558 million, up 17% year-over-year. It was also ahead of its guidance range of $553 million to $557 million and the Street’s call for $556 million. Adjusted income from operations was $163 million, which came in above the guidance range of $135 million to $139 million. Adjusted profits were seven cents a share, a penny above expectations.\n\nGlobal X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ) Machine learning algorithms, Artificial intelligence (AI), Automation and modern technology in business as concept. Machine Learning Stocks\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, if you want to diversify with AI and machine learning stocks, which is always a great move, buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWith an explosion of interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning stocks, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) ran from about $25.50 in late 2023 to a recent high of $31.90. But this is just the start. With AI/ML only set to grow, the AIQ ETF could easily double, if not triple over the next few years – especially with holdings like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) popping.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.68%, the ETF is investing in companies benefiting from the “development and utilization of AI technology in their products and services, as well as in companies that provide hardware facilitating the use of AI for the analysis of big data,” as noted by GlobalXETFs.com.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Overview of Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s Recent Trade Action\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio), a renowned investment management firm, has recently made a significant adjustment to its holdings in Sweetgreen Inc (NYSE:SG). On December 1, 2023, the firm reduced its position in the company by selling 417,392 shares at a trade price of $9.96. Following this transaction, Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s total share count in Sweetgreen stands at 11,592,537, which represents an 11.66% ownership stake in the company and a 0.11% position in the firm's portfolio. Despite the sizeable share change, the trade impact on Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio is currently marked as 0.\n\nInvestment Philosophy of Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) has established itself as a prominent investment management partnership with over a century of history. The firm is committed to prioritizing existing clients' interests and maintaining the integrity of its strategies through a rigorous process of fundamental analysis and proprietary research. Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s investment approach is characterized by long-term, bottom-up investing, focusing on identifying companies with the potential for sustainable, above-average growth. The firm's portfolio includes top holdings such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), MercadoLibre Inc (NASDAQ:MELI), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), and PDD Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PDD), with a strong emphasis on the technology and consumer cyclical sectors. Baillie Gifford Adjusts Position in Sweetgreen Inc\n\nSweetgreen Inc: A Fresh Take on Fast Casual Dining\n\nSweetgreen Inc is a next-generation restaurant and lifestyle brand that has been redefining the fast-casual dining experience with its focus on healthy, sustainable, and locally sourced food. Since its IPO on November 18, 2021, Sweetgreen has been committed to creating plant-forward, seasonal meals that resonate with a growing consumer base seeking earth-friendly dining options. The company's business model emphasizes the importance of fresh ingredients and organic, regenerative farming practices.\n\nStory continues Baillie Gifford Adjusts Position in Sweetgreen Inc\n\nTrade Impact and Portfolio Context\n\nThe recent reduction in Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s stake in Sweetgreen Inc has not shown a significant immediate impact on the firm's portfolio, as indicated by the trade impact data. However, this move may reflect a strategic adjustment within Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s investment approach or a response to market conditions. The firm's portfolio remains diverse, with Sweetgreen constituting a small but notable part of its investment landscape.\n\nMarket Performance and Valuation of Sweetgreen Inc\n\nSweetgreen Inc currently holds a market capitalization of $1.18 billion, with a stock price of $10.49. The company's stock has experienced a 5.32% price increase since the trade date, although it has seen a significant decline of 79.83% since its IPO. Year-to-date, the stock has decreased by 5.24%. Due to the company's lack of profitability, as indicated by a PE percentage of 0.00, the GF Value and price to GF Value cannot be evaluated.\n\nFinancial Health and Growth Prospects of Sweetgreen Inc\n\nSweetgreen's financial health is a mixed picture, with a Financial Strength rank of 5/10 and a Profitability Rank of 1/10. The company's Piotroski F-Score is 4, and its Altman Z score is 1.07, which suggests financial stability concerns. However, Sweetgreen's cash to debt ratio of 0.91 is commendable, ranking 99th in its sector. The company's growth metrics, such as revenue growth over three years at 10.90%, contrast with negative EBITDA and earnings growth over the same period.\n\nIndustry Position and Future Outlook for Sweetgreen Inc\n\nIn the competitive restaurant industry, Sweetgreen Inc stands out for its innovative approach to fast-casual dining. However, the company's GF Score of 19/100 indicates potential challenges in future performance. Sweetgreen's industry position will depend on its ability to navigate financial headwinds and capitalize on its unique brand proposition to drive growth and profitability.\n\nConclusion: Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s Strategic Move\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent reduction in Sweetgreen Inc shares may be a tactical decision reflecting the firm's investment strategy and market outlook. While the trade has not significantly impacted Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio, it underscores the importance of monitoring portfolio adjustments by seasoned investment firms. Investors will be watching closely to see how this trade aligns with Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s long-term investment philosophy and the evolving landscape of the restaurant industry.\n\nWarning!

Remitly's financial health is indicated by a GF Score of 24/100, suggesting challenges in future performance potential.\n\nStory continues Baillie Gifford Bolsters Stake in Remitly Global Inc\n\nAnalysis of the Trade's Significance\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s decision to increase its stake in Remitly Global Inc is a strategic move that aligns with the firm's investment philosophy of identifying growth opportunities. The addition of Remitly shares to Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio may be indicative of the firm's confidence in Remitly's long-term growth prospects, despite the company's current financial metrics and stock performance indicators. With a focus on technology and consumer cyclical sectors, Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s increased investment in Remitly could be a calculated bet on the future of digital financial services.\n\nRemitly Global Inc's Market Performance\n\nSince its IPO, Remitly Global Inc's stock has experienced a downward trajectory, with a -68.05% change from the IPO price and a -19.25% decline since the trade date.

The company's Piotroski F-Score of 5 and an Altman Z score of 6.54 suggest moderate financial stability. However, the lack of Growth Rank, GF Value Rank, and Momentum Rank indicates that the company has significant room for improvement in these areas.\n\nMarket Context and Investor Implications\n\nBaillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent transaction in Remitly Global Inc provides valuable insights for value investors. It suggests that despite the company's underwhelming market performance and financial metrics, there may be underlying value or growth potential that has yet to be realized.

        "title": "Forget Tesla: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been one of the best-performing stocks on the market over the last decade as it proved that electric vehicles (EVs) can be a viable business, and even a highly profitable one. However, recently, Tesla stock has been looking surprisingly mortal. The stock trades down by roughly half from its peak in 2021, and its fourth-quarter earnings report shows why the stock has faded.\n\nTesla's revenue growth continues to slow and profits are falling, and that pattern continued in Q4. Automotive revenue rose 1% year over year to $21.6 billion, and overall revenue was up just 3% to $25.2 billion. These metrics reflect the impact of lower prices as the company looks to stay competitive, gain market share, and overcome headwinds from higher interest rates.\n\nAs a result of lower prices, operating income fell 47% year over year to $2.06 billion, and adjusted earnings per share fell 40% to $0.71. Tesla missed estimates on the top and bottom lines, and it also forecast slower production growth in 2024.\n\nSeemingly, Tesla is less of a millionaire-maker stock than it was two years ago. What's an ambitious investor to do with this news? If you're looking for growth stocks that can help make you a millionaire, keep reading. Image source: Tesla.\n\nNvidia has powerful tailwinds pushing it higher\n\nTesla and every other artificial intelligence (AI) stock can't make their technology without the help of one company, and that's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia stock soared over the last year as its chips are in extraordinarily high demand from companies like OpenAI, Oracle, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, among others. Nvidia, which invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), has a significant head start over its rivals. AI systems like OpenAi's ChatGPT and autonomous vehicle systems like Tesla's full self-driving rely on massive training models that use the kind of chips and accelerators Nvidia makes.\n\nThat strong demand should help power Nvidia stock higher this year as it's coming off a third quarter in which revenue tripled year over year and its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit rose by 12x.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs profits have soared, the company's valuation has come down, and it appears to be set for another strong year in 2024 as cloud infrastructure companies and others are still rapidly building out their AI infrastructure. This should favor Nvidia.\n\nGeneral Motors is more profitable than Tesla\n\nTesla made its name in electric vehicles, but there are signs of slowing demand for EVs that could spell trouble for Tesla and its peers. It also creates an opening for traditional automakers like General Motors (NYSE: GM) whose stocks got hammered as investors chased EV stocks and abandoned legacy automakers.\n\nAs a result, GM stock now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 5. GM may not offer the same growth potential that Tesla does, but the company has a growing EV and autonomous vehicle (AV) business in Cruise, whose rollout has taken a pause after San Francisco regulators suspended operations.\n\nGM remains more profitable than Tesla and is reporting solid growth with a 14% increase in vehicles sold to 2.6 million. That's a strong growth clip for a mature business and from a stock priced for no growth. Notably, that's also significantly faster than Tesla's Q4 revenue growth.\n\nGM's low valuation also gives the company a greater opportunity to return cash to shareholders. In fact, the company announced a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November and raised its dividend by 33% to $0.12 a share.\n\nConsidering the growth in its legacy car business and its investments in electric vehicles and autonomy, GM should be able to bridge the gap with EVs and AVs when the time comes. If GM delivers another strong earnings report, the stock could soar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Selling $10 Billion in GPUs to This AI Tech Giant (Hint: It's Not Microsoft)",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price has more than quadrupled over the past three years. Most of that rally was driven by the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, where its data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks.\n\nTwo of its better-known customers are OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and its top backer Microsoft. However, Meta(NASDAQ: META) has also been spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's data center GPUs every year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThat's why it wasn't all that surprising when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said his company would install 350,000 of Nvidia's top-tier H100 GPUs in its data centers by the end of 2024. Zuckerberg didn't disclose how many H100s Meta had purchased so far, but Nvidia only launched the GPU with a limited supply in late 2022.\n\nNvidia is currently selling the H100 for $25,000 to $30,000 each, according to analysts at Raymond James, which implies that Meta will probably spend roughly $8.8 billion to $10.5 billion on Nvidia's GPUs over a two-year period. Let's see why that's a bright green flag for Nvidia -- and what it tells us about Meta's near-term challenges and longer-term plans.\n\nWhy Meta's support is great news for Nvidia\n\nNvidia generated $29.1 billion in revenue, or 75% of its top line, from its data center chips in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, which started last January. That's up from 52% of its total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.\n\nThe bulls believe this business will continue expanding as the AI market grows, but the bears expect the AI market to cool off and for new competitors to enter the ring. Meta's big GPU purchases counter those bearish claims in two ways.\n\nFirst, Meta probably wouldn't spend about $10 billion -- equivalent to about 17% of its combined capital expenditures (capex) of $31 billion in 2023 and $28 billion in projected capex for 2024 -- on Nvidia's H100 GPUs if it thought the AI market was cooling off. Instead, the social media giant probably expects that market to heat up as cloud leaders including Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google expand their own AI ecosystems.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Precedence Research, the broader AI market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% from 2023 to 2032. Fortune Business Insights expects the generative AI niche to expand at an even faster CAGR of 47.5%. Providing the building blocks for that booming market could drive Nvidia's stock a lot higher.\n\nSecond, Meta allays some concerns that Nvidia's largest customers will replace its GPUs with their own in-house chips. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have all been developing their own AI chips, but their ongoing purchases of Nvidia's GPUs suggest it could still be years before they produce comparable chips. Instead, their custom chips will probably work in tandem with Nvidia's GPUs to process AI tasks for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat Meta's GPU purchases tell us about its future\n\nBut for Meta, its massive purchases of Nvidia's GPUs raise some questions about its future. It's still burning billions of dollars on the expansion of its Reality Labs segment, which racked up steep operating losses of $13.7 billion in 2022 and $11.5 billion in the first nine months of 2023 as it rolled out new augmented and virtual reality devices. Its big GPU purchases from Nvidia could exacerbate that pressure -- which already reduced its operating margin from 41% in 2019 to 25% in 2022.\n\nMeta's revenue growth accelerated throughout 2023 as its core advertising business recovered, but that recovery was mainly driven by Chinese e-commerce marketplaces including PDD's Temu and Shein, which ramped up their spending on Meta's platforms to promote their products to overseas customers. If those companies rein in their ad purchases as Meta increases its spending on the expansion of its data centers and Reality Labs segment, its operating margin will shrink again.\n\nBut over the long term, Meta's data center investments could pay off by making its AI algorithms more effective at crafting targeted ads, figuring out which Reels keep viewers engaged, and calculating the best prices for its programmatic ads. Meta's collection of first-party data should also completely eliminate its dependence on Apple, which cut off Facebook and Instagram from its third-party iOS data with a major update in 2021.\n\nIt's good news for both companies\n\nMeta's commitment to Nvidia indicates that the chipmaker will remain a linchpin of the AI market for years to come. It should boost Nvidia's data center GPU sales and widen Meta's own moat against other ad-driven tech giants such as Google. Simply put, this big GPU purchase is great news for both companies -- although Nvidia will initially generate more sales growth from that deal at the expense of Meta's near-term margins.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Here's What History Says Investors Can Expect From Nvidia in the Next Few Years",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the top stocks in 2023, rising 239%. While some thought this may have been Nvidia's ceiling, that has been far from the truth. In just under a month in 2024, Nvidia has already risen 21%, giving the impression that 2024 could be a repeat year for the stock.\n\nHowever, much of the optimism baked into the stock ignores an ugly truth about Nvidia that many people forget: It's a cyclical company. So, what can investors expect in the next few years? Let's take a look at what history says.\n\nPrevious demand crashes should guide investor sentiment\n\nNvidia has done so well over the past year because it makes the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) suited for artificial intelligence (AI). Originally, GPUs were created to improve gaming graphics, which required significant computing power. Soon, the use of GPUs for other arduous computing tasks like AI model training, engineering simulations, drug discovery, and mapping the human genome would be sped up by using hundreds or thousands of GPUs connected together.\n\nBecause of the AI arms race, many companies raced to build supercomputers to train their AI models. This fueled Nvidia's growth and resulted in Nvidia's revenue more than tripling year over year in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 29, 2023). However, many people forget that Nvidia was in a massive slump at the start of 2023, as its cyclical nature reared its head throughout 2022.\n\nAnother use for Nvidia's GPUs is cryptocurrency mining. This industry has had two major boom-and-bust cycles, one at the start of 2018 and the other during 2021. When crypto prices fall, mining cryptocurrency becomes unprofitable, as the input costs far outweigh the output. As a result, crypto miners don't purchase as many GPUs (or purchase none at all), which affects Nvidia's business significantly.\n\nIn the years following a crypto crash, Nvidia saw its revenue dip.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhen Nvidia's revenue dips, it isn't optimized for profits, so its earnings fall even more dramatically. NVDA EPS Basic (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSo, what does this have to do with today's AI-fueled GPU purchasing?\n\nNvidia may see demand evaporate soon\n\nBecause GPUs are hardware, they don't need to be purchased continually. While many companies are still outfitting their supercomputers, others have already built theirs.\n\nTake Tesla's Dojo computer, for example. It required 10,000 H100 GPUs from Nvidia and likely cost more than $300 million in GPUs alone, with the average price of an H100 GPU being about $30,000. Will Tesla need to build another Dojo computer each year? Likely not.\n\nThis could cause Nvidia's downfall in the next few years: Customers won't need to buy GPUs continuously. However, the problem with this analysis is that I have no idea when this will occur or how low the demand will fall.\n\nNvidia's previous cyclical declines only brought the revenue down around 20%. If Nvidia is still slated to double from its current levels, then even if business falls 20% once demand has been satisfied, the stock still has room for more upside. On the other hand, if the business will fall 20% from current levels, the stock is currently overvalued.\n\nAdditionally, 20% may be a conservative number, as once these companies build out their infrastructure, they may be set for many years.\n\nI have no idea when Nvidia's business will top out and how far it will go when business declines. But I know that it's coming. With how fully valued the company is today (160 times earnings), investors need to be careful if they're taking a position in the stock at today's prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "My Top-5 AI Growth Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist for 2024",
        "content": "The S&P 500 recently reached a new record high, signaling a bull market is here, and that means it's a fantastic time to bet on growth. Bull markets tend to favor growth stocks, and history shows us these times of market gains last longer than bear markets -- on average almost three years versus nine months. So there's reason right now to load up on stocks that may excel in this sort of environment and benefit from the momentum.\n\nThat's why I've got my eye on companies involved in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI) from chipmakers that power AI tools to companies using this technology to improve their operations. At a compound annual growth rate of about 21%, the AI market is forecast to reach more than $2 trillion by 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights. Companies investing now could greatly benefit down the road -- and so could you. Here are my top-five AI growth stocks to buy hand over fist for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is almost synonymous with AI these days. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) power the training of AI systems, the \"deep learning\" that allows them to understand complex concepts and deliver answers to our questions.\n\nNvidia has built an 80%-to-95% share of the AI chip market, according to analysts, and that's unlikely to change any time soon for two reasons. First, Nvidia now is a clear leader, so it may be difficult for rivals to attract customers away from the industry's \"go-to\" chipmaker. Second, Nvidia invests heavily in research and development (R&D), so it should stay ahead thanks to innovation too. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia's R&D spending increased 18% to more than $2.2 billion.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia's investments are bearing fruit, with return on invested capital soaring in recent times. NVDA Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nNVDA Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia's revenue has climbed over the past few years as it broadened its dominance from GPUs to power gaming and graphics to leadership in AI. And the company's profit has advanced too. Considering Nvidia's financial strength and AI market share, the stock is a no-brainer AI buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAI is helping Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) excel in both its e-commerce and cloud-computing businesses. The company has used AI in e-commerce for a while now, in everything from making warehouse operations and fulfillment more efficient to helping you, the customer, find just the right item. So, here, AI helps Amazon gain in efficiency, thereby lowering costs. By offering you a positive shopping experience, you're likely to come back. That's a double victory for Amazon's earnings.\n\nAs for cloud computing, Amazon has developed several AI tools that it offers its customers. For example, Amazon Bedrock gives clients access to top foundation models they can customize for their own use -- without having to build from the ground up or manage infrastructure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also offers Code Whisperer, a service that suggests code to developers, saving them valuable time.\n\nGenerative AI is \"top of mind\" for clients, Amazon said in its recent earnings call, so AWS, as the world's cloud-market leader, is in the perfect place to benefit in the years to come.\n\n3. Moderna\n\nModerna (NASDAQ: MRNA) may not be the first company that comes to mind when you think of AI. After all, it's a biotech developing vaccines based on mRNA technology. But Moderna actually could be a winner of the AI revolution and is investing in the technology today to increase its chances of that happening.\n\nModerna uses AI across its entire business, even launching an \"AI academy\" to train employees. But where AI really might change the game is in the area of drug development.\n\nModerna applies AI to explore relationships between the vast amounts of data it's collected over the years to produce better candidates. The company even signed a collaboration with International Business Machines (IBM) last year to use its AI tools. For example, an IBM foundation model can help predict a molecule's properties, helping scientists immediately understand the characteristics of a potential medicine.\n\nThe idea is AI can help Moderna more quickly identify the best candidates, and that may speed up the drug-development process, bringing products to market faster. This could score a win for Moderna, patients, and investors.\n\n4. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic(NYSE: MDT) is another potential winner in the AI-in-healthcare market -- a market expected to reach $208 billion in 2030 from $32 billion today, according to Grand View Research. Like Moderna, Medtronic has put the focus on this hot technology, creating an AI Center of Excellence.\n\nThe medical device giant created the center of excellence to cost-effectively drive AI innovation across its businesses with the goal of maintaining leadership in AI-enabled healthcare. Medtronic already uses AI across many of its products from the GI Genius endoscopy tool to the Touch Surgery Enterprise platform for AI-enabled surgery. So, it's well on the way to being a major player in the AI-in-healthcare revolution.\n\nOn top of this, you'll like the fact that Medtronic, following a transformation plan to become more efficient, may be heading into a new era of growth. In the most recent quarter, Medtronic reported growth across its business segments and geographies. Considering Medtronic's products hold Nos. 1 to 3 market-share positions, this performance may continue over time.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), parent of search giant Google, already has delivered an impressive track record of growth, as seen in the chart below. GOOG Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nGOOG Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nNow, AI may be set to deliver a new boost. Your searches on Google are about to garner even better results thanks to Alphabet's focus on this potentially game-changing technology. Alphabet recently unveiled its most powerful AI tool yet, Gemini, and tests of Gemini in search have resulted in improvements in quality and speed.\n\nWhy is this important? Google holds more than 90% of the search market right now, making it the leader by far. Supercharging Google search's capabilities should reinforce this leadership. That, in turn, should keep advertisers flocking to Google. Since this is Alphabet's biggest source of revenue, keeping Google search at the top of its game is crucial.\n\nAlphabet plans on applying Gemini across its products, from its smartphone to its cloud-computing offerings, so this investment in AI should go pretty far when it comes to driving growth. And that's why Alphabet is a top AI stock to buy this year in the new bull market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With More Upside Than Nvidia to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Investors bought shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) hand over fist last year, as excitement about artificial intelligence (AI) percolated the stock market. In fact, the AI chipmaker saw its share price climbed 239%, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023. Nvidia has already advanced another 20% in 2024, but Wall Street now sees more upside in other AI stocks.\n\nTo elaborate, Nvidia has a median analyst price target of $650 per share, implying a 9% upside. But The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) has a median price target of $83 per share, implying 20% upside. And Docebo(NASDAQ: DCBO) has a median price target of $56 per share, implying 24% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these two AI stocks.\n\n1. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk operates the largest independent ad tech platform for media buyers. Its software leans on artificial intelligence (AI) to help advertisers create, measure, and optimize campaigns across digital channels. The Trade Desk is the market leader in connected TV (CTV) advertising, and the company is quickly gaining clout in offsite retail media, the two fastest-growing segments of the broader digital advertising market.\n\nOne reason The Trade Desk has been so successful is its independent business model, meaning it doesn't own media that could bias ad spending, nor does it compete with publishers by selling ad inventory. Publishers are more willing to share data with noncompetitors like The Trade Desk as opposed to fellow publishers like Alphabet, a company that monetizes media properties like Google Search and YouTube with advertising.\n\nBecause of a unique combination of independence and scale, The Trade Desk has won numerous partners of import. It sources data and inventory from most major CTV publishers, including Walt Disney, and it sources data from many leading retailers including Walmart. As such, The Trade Desk provides measurement capabilities that media buyers cannot find on other ad tech platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne corollary of robust and unique data is differentiated AI. To that end, Morgan Stanley sees The Trade Desk as one of 11 companies best positioned to benefit from AI, and consultancy Quadrant Knowledge Solutions sees The Trade Desk as the most technologically sophisticated ad tech platform on the market, outranking even Google.\n\nLooking ahead, ad tech spending is forecasted to grow at 14% annually through 2030, but The Trade Desk should outpace the industry given its strong market position. Indeed, Wall Street is projecting annual sales growth of 21% over the next five years. In that context, its current valuation of 19.4 times sales is tolerable. Patient investors with a five-year time horizon should consider buying a small position in this growth stock today.\n\n2. Docebo\n\nDocebo operates a learning management system. Its platform comprises several applications that help businesses create, deliver, and measure the impact of training content across internal employees and external audiences. Two applications are particularly noteworthy because they demonstrate a proclivity for innovation and they present sizable growth opportunities.\n\nDocebo Shape uses generative AI to automate content creation, turning source material like documents, presentations, and case studies into corporate training material. Docebo Flow embeds learning content into other software products, which lends itself to external use cases like customer training. For instance, Flow lets businesses embed learning into customer-facing applications for the purpose of educating new users.\n\nDocebo gained a strong market presence through consistent innovation. European industry analyst Fosway Group has recognized its leadership in learning management systems for six straight years. In addition, Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Baer selected Docebo stock as a top generative AI pick in 2024. He said the company is not just disrupting the market for internal learning, but also leading the market in external use cases.\n\nDocebo is an unfamiliar name for many investors, but the company has landed several big customers, including two of the five largest technology companies in the world. The first is Amazon and the second is unnamed, but all evidence points to Google.\n\nMeanwhile, Docebo has also partnered with Google Cloud to further its generative AI product roadmap. New features are coming to Shape in 2024, including virtual role play with real-time feedback and an integrated copilot that simplifies learning content creation. Management says \"Shape will fundamentally change how training material is created and consumed.\"\n\nWith that in mind, the learning management systems market is forecasted to grow at 20% annually through 2030, and Wall Street expects Docebo to grow sales at 25% annually over the next five years. That consensus forecast makes its current valuation of 9 times sales look downright cheap. The market is overlooking this little-known software stock, creating a fabulous buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and The Trade Desk wasn't one of them.

        "title": "11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli.\n\nBillionaire Mario Gabelli in 1976 founded Gabelli & Co. as an institutional brokerage house. Over the years the firm went through an evolution and today it's one of the biggest investment firms operating as GAMCO Investors. The 81-year-old billionaire has a net worth of about $1.6 billion according to Forbes. In November 2023, Gabelli, while talking to CNBC, said that the US consumer is an incredibly strong position since the overall net worth of consumers in the country has gone up significantly over the past few years. However, Gabelli said income disparity in the US is high. Gabelli named several spending acts by the US government and said while the Fed is trying to reduce the aggregate demand, the amount of money the US government is putting in the system is having an opposite effect. Gabelli then went on to talk about the \"short-termism\" of the market and said while uncertainties remain and we cannot predict events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one can still make money investing in the stock market.\n\n\"You can make a lot of money in the market.. by doing simple things like buying specific stocks.\"\n\nBut how does Gabelli find \"specific stocks\" to invest in? GAMCO in a report highlighted that instead of always focusing on short-term earnings cycles and news, it focuses on true value of companies and positions itself for long-term earnings trends.\n\n\"We want to know everything and anything that will add to, or detract from, our valuation estimates. This method of analysis involves looking at businesses as a function of their assets and earnings power. We examine businesses as if we were owners of those businesses, and we believe that we can do that in a rational way by looking at industries on a global basis. Our investment professionals visit with hundreds of companies each year. Our work is proprietary, bottom up, and involves the full utilization of public resources. We calculate the Private Market Value (PMV) estimate of the business, which is what an informed strategic buyer would pay for a business in its entirety in a private transaction. Effectively, it is the intrinsic value plus a strategic premium. Finally, we look for a catalyst: something happening in the company’s industry or indigenous to the company itself that will help realize returns. A company’s PMV is not constant, and changes as a function of many variables. The objective is to identify large differences between our estimate of PMV and the stock market price. We then identify the catalyst to realize a return with minimal influence from the overall direction of the stock market. It is our belief that we can earn superior risk adjusted returns following this event-driven approach.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn another interview in August last year, Gabelli said that markets go up and down but what's important is that we want to invest in good companies with strong management and valuations. Gabelli said that there are opportunities beyond just the Magnificent Seven. Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned GAMCO's Q3'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks with PE ratios less than 20. We ranked these stocks in ascending order of GAMCO's stakes in terms of dollar value. Gabelli is a fan of undervalued companies and usually focuses on under-the-radar names, unlike many other hedge funds who have billions poured in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n11. Deere & Co (NYSE:DE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nGAMCO's Stake: $69M\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) ranks 11th in our list of the undervalued stocks to buy according to billionaire Mario Gabelli.

We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nBillionaire Gabelli’s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential 12 Best High Yield Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Gabelli Mario Gabelli Stock Portfolio: 10 Top Stock Picks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia's Soaring Stock Be in 10 Years?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) growth thesis hinges on generative artificial intelligence (AI) -- a tech megatrend sending demand for its advanced hardware through the roof. And according to analyst projections, this booming market has plenty of room left to run. That said, the company could find even more synergistic growth drivers over the long term. Let's dig deeper into what the next 10 years could hold.\n\nTurning the GPU into a trillion-dollar growth engine\n\nWhen Nvidia was founded in 1993, it would have been hard to imagine that the hardware it was pioneering, the graphics processing unit (GPU), would have such a transformative effect on the technology landscape.\n\nOriginally designed to render video-game visuals, GPUs work through parallel processing, which involves computing multiple tasks simultaneously. This functionality made them extremely useful for new uses like cryptocurrency mining and training the large language models (LLM) behind generative AI applications.\n\nFor Nvidia, these trends have transformed its operations. As of the third quarter, data center chip sales (such as the AI-capable H100) make up 80% of revenue, while its previously core gaming business has fallen to just under 16%.\n\nWith industry experts expecting the market for AI chips to rise to $400 billion by 2027, Nvidia has plenty of room for near-term growth by selling its hardware. But the company will almost certainly face rising competition, which could eventually erode its market share and margins. To keep delivering market-beating growth, Nvidia may have to reinvent itself once again -- and management looks capable of pulling it off.\n\nCould Nvidia become a software company?\n\nThe tech industry has several hardware companies that transitioned to more software-dependent business models to protect their economic moats and stabilize revenue streams. One of the best examples is Apple, which used sales of its industry-leading iPhones to drive iOS and app store adoption. According to analysts at Melius Research, Nvidia could be on the cusp of a similar move as it pivots to software and services.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has long relied on custom software to help data center clients make the most of their GPU-based systems. But over time, this business could become a core growth driver in its own right.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has launched a new AI supercomputer called DGX Cloud, which uses cutting-edge hardware to allow enterprise clients to build and deploy customized AI models without having to create their own data center infrastructure. Naturally, this move will bring the chipmaker into competition with traditional cloud service providers like Amazon AWS and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, Nvidia's technical lead designing the GPUs that run these platforms gives it a competitive edge to rapidly scale this new growth driver.\n\nWhere will Nvidia be in the next 10 years?\n\nWith a market cap around $1.50 trillion, Nvidia is already the sixth most valuable company in the world. And it probably isn't a coincidence that three of the companies above it (Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon) attained their position by transitioning away from only physical products into software. Over the next 10 years, Nvidia has significant growth potential, and I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually overtakes some of its large rivals.\n\nWhile shares have already risen 211% over the last 12 months, the company still boasts a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30, which is in line with the NASDAQ 100 average. That means it isn't too late for investors to bet on Nvidia's long-term success.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Billionaire Mason Hawkins’ 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theBillionaire Mason Hawkins' 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Billionaire Mason Hawkins' 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nOtis \"Mason\" Hawkins is a famous value investor who founded Southeastern Asset Management in 1975. Hawkins is estimated to be worth around $1.8 billion and his hedge fund had about $5.5 billion in assets under management as of March 2023. Southeastern Asset Management hunts for bottom-up opportunities around the globe, with the fund's core value and investing philosophy finding its roots in Benjamin Graham's value investing approach. Hawkins is among the traditional class of value investors who staunchly stick to age-old, tried and tested value investing principles. Back in 2008, Hawkins was asked during an interview how he examines intrinsic value of companies. The billionaire said he focuses on free cash flow as he and his team tries to project FCF for the next seven years, \"put a low or no growth terminal multiple on the business past 7 years, and discount back at a conservative discount rate.\"\n\n\"The second method calculates net asset value by adjusting book values of assets and liabilities to current liquidation values. (For example, real estate is rarely worth the original cost carried on the books, particularly if it’s been held for a long period.) Third, we check our longhand math against a data base of comparable transactions over the last 30 years, taking into account the interest rate environment at the time of the transactions. We mark our appraisal to the lower of the two values when comparable sales and our longhand math differ,\" Hawkins added.\n\nLongleaf Partners Funds, where Hawkins is a co-portfolio manager, is also a notable fund backed by Southeastern and regularly posts its performance and commentary on its website. The fund said in its Q4'2023 letter that it more than doubled the Russell 1000 Value Index, \"almost equalled the tech-led S&P 500 Index and approximately doubled\" its absolute return goal of inflation plus 10%. The fund said when everyone was busy worrying about recession, its team was finding contrarian opportunities:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our research team was busy in 2023. At the start of the year when everyone was still predicting an imminent recession, we saw opportunity as contrarians and improved our portfolio with weighting changes and compelling new investments, many of which have already contributed to the portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we have seen a growing consensus about a soft landing. This consensus view concerns us for the same reasons we were excited to be buying earlier in the year when everyone was fearful. However, we are confident in our ability to keep delivering double-digit returns with our portfolio of competitively advantaged, financially strong businesses with management teams that can take self-help measures in any environment. 2023 showed us that our investment approach can add meaningful value, even in a challenging period for bottom-up active equity managers.\" Mason Hawkins' Top Stocks with Upside Potential\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Mason Hawkins' Q3'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks with the highest upside potential from their current prices based on average analyst price estimates. Unlike many other hedge funds, Hawkins' top positions are not in stocks like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the value investor is looking at undervalued companies that are still under the radar. We ranked this list in ascending order of upside potential of these stocks. We also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors for these stocks. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $149\n\nUpside Potential: 6.43%\n\nBillionaire Mason Hawkins owns a $47 million stake in financial services company Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. Yahoo Finance data shows that Wall Street analysts have set a $149 price target on the stock for the next 12 months, while the stock was trading at around $137.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI).\n\nEarlier this month, Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform from Perform. Oppenheimer's analyst Dominick Gabriele said in his note that Fiserv Inc's (NYSE:FI) \"penetration expectation\" through 2026 is impressive and adds an \"upward upward bias for sustaining high total company margin expansion.\"\n\nGiverny Capital Asset Management made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Turning to our new positions, we have been following Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) for a couple of years now and finally bought a position during the third quarter. Fiserv has two businesses that reinforce each other: it is a key technology provider to several thousand global banks and credit unions. Mid-sized financial institutions need to offer a full complement of digital banking services to compete with larger national banks, but they can’t afford to build out an internal tech capacity. It’s more cost effective to outsource to Fiserv.\n\nFiserv’s other business is, broadly, payment processing: when you tap and pay at your favorite restaurant or retailer, you may be using a Fiserv device. That device, in turn, may connect directly to the business owner’s bank – and Fiserv built out the bank’s tech stack. The synergy here is important. Fiserv can sell terminals to the restaurant itself, but banks may also sell Fiserv products as part of their customer relationships. There is terrific distribution synergy\n\nFor the next few years, Fiserv’s growth should be led by Clover, a payments acceptance system that offers merchants faster transaction times, better fraud protection and stronger operational controls than many existing acceptance networks. While Clover is a clear leader in acceptance, it has a small market share today and could grow at double digit rates for some years. In turn, that should drive solid earnings growth for Fiserv. I believe the stock trades for a low-teens multiple of likely 2024 earnings, an attractive price for a steady compounder.”\n\n10. XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $96\n\nUpside Potential: 10.34%\n\nAmerican transportation company XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks in billionaire Mason Hawkins' portfolio with upside potential. According to Yahoo Finance, the stock's one-year average price estimate is $96. In October XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.88, beating estimates by $0.24. Revenue in the quarter jumped 1.7% year over year to $1.98 billion, surpassing estimates by $50 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Hawkins owns  a $1.2 million stake in XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO).\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our holdings in the industrials sector also contributed during the quarter. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO), which provides freight transportation services internationally, rallied on the news that industry competitor Yellow had filed for bankruptcy, resulting in market share gains for XPO.”\n\n9. Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $45.50\n\nUpside Potential: 15.14%\n\nAsset management company Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ) ranks eighth in our list of the top Mason Hawkins stocks with upside potential. The stock was trading at around $38.47 as of January 17 while its average price target set by analysts for the next 12 months is $45.50.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 13 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ). The biggest stakeholder of Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ) during this period was John W. Rogers' Ariel Investments which owns a $222 million stake in Lazard Inc (NYSE:LAZ).\n\n8. Affiliated Managers Group Inc (NYSE:AMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $176\n\nUpside Potential: 16.85%\n\nBillionaire Mason Hawkins owns a $118 million stake in investment management company Affiliated Managers Group Inc (NYSE:AMG). The stock was trading at around $147.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 28 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Affiliated Managers Group Inc (NYSE:AMG). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Affiliated Managers Group Inc (NYSE:AMG) was John W. Rogers' Ariel Investments which owns a $155 million stake.\n\nAriel Small Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Also in the quarter, we initiated a new position in boutique asset manager, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG). AMG has a unique business model in which it purchases meaningful equity interests in boutique asset management firms and in return receives a fixed percentage of revenues. The Company’s partnership approach allows for its affiliates’ management teams to own significant equity while maintaining operational independence. We believe AMG’s size and scale allow the company to be the leading destination for growing boutique firms addressing succession issues and/or seeking assistance in marketing, distribution and product development. In our view, investors currently underappreciate the company’s active and alternative-asset affiliate business model.”\n\n7. FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 67\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $297\n\nUpside Potential: 17.39%\n\nFedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) ranks seventh in our list of the best Mason Hawkins' stocks to buy with upside potential. Hawkins' fund owns a $158.1 million stake in FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).\n\nIn December FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said it plans to buy back $1 billion worth of shares.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 67 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).\n\nIn addition to FedEx, hedge funds also like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n6. Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nAverage Analyst Price Estimate: $112\n\nUpside Potential: 25.84%\n\nEntertainment company Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) shares have gained about 19% over the past one year. They were trading at around $90.60 as of January 17. According to Yahoo Finance data, the stock's average analyst price estimate is $112.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 40 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) during this period was Robert Joseph Caruso's Select Equity Group which owns a $924 million stake in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV).\n\nRoth MKM recently upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral and upped its price target to $114 from $92.\n\nThe analyst said demand of live events over the next few years will be above-average.\n\nLike Live Nation, hedge funds also like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nBaron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Liberty Media Corporation-Liberty Live is a tracking stock created on 8/4/2023 representing Liberty Media Corporation’s holdings in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Billionaire Mason Hawkins' 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets 10 Stocks with 50% Upside Potential According to Analysts 12 Extreme Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "A Wall Street Analyst Believes This Semiconductor Stock Is Better Than Nvidia, and It Could Jump an Impressive 71%",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have been in fine form on the market, which is evident from the impressive 56% gains recorded by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index over the past year. Graphics specialist Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has played a starring role in this surge as its shares have shot up a whopping 233% during this period, driven by the company's rock-solid position in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have witnessed massive demand thanks to their ability to train large language models (LLMs), which form the backbone of popular applications such as ChatGPT. The price of each AI-focused GPU that Nvidia sells can range from $10,000 to $30,000. It is worth noting that the company reportedly makes a profit of almost 1,000% on these chips, according to investment banking firm Raymond James.\n\nThe market for AI chips is set to grow rapidly in the future and Nvidia is in the pole position to capitalize on its growth, but Citi analyst Atif Malik believes that Marvell Technology(NASDAQ: MRVL) could be a better semiconductor pick than Nvidia. Let's see why.\n\nMarvell Technology is becoming another solid AI semiconductor play\n\nThe Citi analyst maintained his buy rating on Marvell stock and pointed out that the company is well placed to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI chips and its optical modules that enable high-speed communication between data centers. Malik, however, is not the only one upbeat about Marvell's prospects.\n\nRick Schafer of Oppenheimer is predicting an acceleration in Marvell's sales this year thanks to its AI exposure, pointing out that the company's data center storage and switching solutions will witness stronger demand. Schafer believes that Marvell stands to gain from multiple new product cycles and potential content gains, which explains why the analyst has an outperform rating on the stock.\n\nA closer look at the semiconductor solutions that Marvell provides will tell us just why Wall Street is upbeat about the company's AI-related prospects. Marvell is known for making custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which the company says are customized \"for the unique demands of each AI, cloud data center and OEM customer.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is worth noting that major cloud service providers such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have been focused on the development of custom ASICs for tackling AI workloads. The reason why these major AI players are developing custom AI chips is that they can help them derive more performance and power efficiency. That's not surprising as ASICs are programmed to run specific workloads and perform dedicated operations, and they can help accelerate AI training and inference models as a result.\n\nMorgan Stanley estimates that ASICs could account for 30% of the overall AI chip market by 2027, which the investment bank believes could be worth $182 billion then. So, the market for AI-focused ASICs could be worth almost $55 billion a year in 2027 based on Morgan Stanley's estimates. This could unlock a healthy growth opportunity for Marvell considering that it has generated $5.5 billion in revenue in the past year.\n\nHow much upside can investors expect?\n\nMarvell Technology reportedly controls 12% of the ASIC market, according to JPMorgan. Assuming Marvell can hold on to this share in 2027 and the market for AI-focused ASICs indeed hits $55 billion, the company is looking at an additional $6.6 billion in AI-related revenue. That would be a big jump over Marvell's current quarterly revenue run rate of $200 million from AI-driven chip sales, as well as the potential $1 billion revenue that the company could generate from this market in fiscal 2025 (which will begin at the end of this month).\n\nAnalysts are predicting Marvell's top-line growth to accelerate following a 7% decline in fiscal 2024 to $5.5 billion, jumping to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2025 and $7.3 billion in 2026. The pace of growth could be higher considering the additional AI-related revenue that Marvell could generate, as was just noted.\n\nAssuming Marvell does achieve incremental revenue of $6.6 billion by 2027 (which will coincide with the majority of its fiscal year 2028), its top line could increase to $12 billion after four years -- more than double the fiscal 2024 estimate of $5.5 billion. Multiplying the projected revenue with Marvell's five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 8.6 points toward a market cap of $103 billion, which would translate into 71% gains from current levels.\n\nWith Marvell currently trading at 11 times sales, it isn't too expensive based on historical levels, especially considering the new growth driver it could benefit from. So, investors looking to buy an AI stock that isn't as expensive as Nvidia -- which trades at 33 times sales -- can consider buying Marvell Technology as it could indeed win big from the growing sales of custom AI chips in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Marvell Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Marvell Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Marvell Technology wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Analyst Upgrades: 7 Stocks Predicted to Soar in Q1 2024",
        "content": "Earnings season is a great time for data-hungry investors. Even though a company’s earnings report is largely backward-looking, it’s also an opportunity for companies to provide guidance for upcoming quarters.\n\nAnother signal that investors can look for is analyst upgrades. If an earnings report is a progress report, an analyst rating gives the stock a grade: buy, hold or sell. Once a company reports earnings, analysts that cover the company will issue a rating and/or price target.\n\nObviously, investors should look for companies that get a significant amount of analyst upgrades after they report earnings. And, although many analysts wait until after the earnings report to issue ratings, some analysts release this information prior to earnings. That’s even better.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUsing a stock screener, I found a list of companies that have received the most analyst upgrades in the last 30 days. That’s a good sign that institutional investors will be buying these stocks. Don’t fight the trend. These are solid names to ride higher along with analyst sentiment.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed across\n\nSource: xalien / Shutterstock\n\nComing off a bullish earnings report, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is an easy choice as a stock that analysts love in the first quarter of 2024. As of this writing, the streaming giant has received 30 analyst upgrades and/or boosts to its price target.\n\nThe company checked off all the boxes in its fourth quarter earnings report. Subscriber count is up as is ad revenue. The company is successfully cracking down on password sharing and has passed along a price increase to its basic and premium (ad-free) subscribers.\n\nAll of this is bullish for the company’s margins and cash flow which will likely break records in 2024. Plus, the company’s new contract with WWE, beginning in 2024, is a clever way to engage with live sports, one of the coveted growth drivers for all streaming drivers.\n\nThe consensus price target shows a gain of about 7.5% for NFLX stock. But several analysts are bidding the stock up between 20% and 25%. And this was on top of the company’s stock price being up 50% in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nLam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe semiconductor sector continues to be in a super cycle. Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) doesn’t manufacture semiconductor chips, but it does make the equipment that chip makers need. And as Rich Duprey explained to InvestorPlace readers, there’s one particular area, etching, that is making the company a particularly attractive investment in 2024.\n\nThe company has 10 analyst upgrades in the last 30 days. However, as I write this, Lam is only a day removed from reporting its fourth quarter and full-year earnings in which it beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. You can expect LAM stock to get more upgrades.\n\nTrading at an all-time high of over $869 a share, LAM stock may be due for a pullback. So if you don’t have a position, you may want to wait for a slightly better price. But for those who have ridden the 73% stock price gain in the last 12 months, this is a good Hold especially when you can collect a safe dividend that pays only $8 per share on an annual basis today but has plenty of room to move higher.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou’ll have to take my word for it, but when I started researching this article, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had 10 analyst upgrades in the last 30 days. It’s now up to 13. What’s particularly bullish about the upgrades to AMC stock is that they are occurring in advance of the company’s earnings report on January 30, 2024.\n\nIt’s not hard to see why. It will be hard for any company to have another Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) moment like we saw in 2023. But with the launch of its MI300X GPU chipset, the company is well-positioned to take market share from Nvidia simply because of the overwhelming demand in the sector.\n\nHere’s where investors need to watch carefully. As of this writing, AMD stock is trading north of $180 a share. The consensus target is still around $158. That doesn’t mean the stock is going to drop more than 15%. But it does suggest that the stock may be frontrunning earnings just a bit. Look to buy AMD on any dip.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) A can of Monster Beverage (MNST) energy drinks sits on top of a skateboard.\n\nSource: Domagoj Kovacic / Shutterstock.com\n\nChecking in with five analyst upgrades is Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). In the last five years, MNST stock has rewarded investors with a “monster” 97% gain.\n\nHowever, as the stock price has grown so has the company’s valuation. Monster now trades at around 35x forward earnings. That’s in line with the company’s historic average, which is higher than the consumer staples sector average of around 27x earnings.\n\nIf you’re going to pay that premium, you’ll want to know how likely it is that Monster will hit its projection for 15% earnings growth in the next year. The bullish analyst sentiment for a stock that has split six times with the most recent occurring in March 2023 is encouraging.\n\nSupporting analyst sentiment is the company’s 30% market share in its core category of energy drinks. Monster also began branching out into alcoholic beverages in 2023. Right now, that makes up just a fraction of the company’s overall sales, but it’s a growing category that will be additive to both revenue and margin in the coming years.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) has eight upgrades with the stock expected to have 6.6% upside in the next 12 months. The athleisure company best known for its iconic yoga pants is proving that consumers and investors will do well by buying the best.\n\nThe initial reading on fourth quarter GDP came in hotter than expected. But investors may have expected that when they saw that Lululemon increased its sales and profit forecast for the fourth quarter based on a strong holiday season.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts are racing to catch up to LULU stock which in late 2023 was changing hands for around $511 a share. It’s dropped about 7% in the last month. But the stock looks to be finding support in the $465 range. And with earnings not scheduled until the end of March, investors may be able to grab some shares before what is likely to be another strong report.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSo far, the stocks on this list have been growth stocks. With bullish analyst sentiment, they will be solid choices even if the economy continues to struggle. However, investors with a lower risk tolerance may be looking for stocks that come with less volatility. One option is to look for high-quality dividend stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).\n\nThe case for Procter & Gamble is simple enough. The company is part of the consumer staples sector. It has products consumers need, not want. And in many cases, consumers are still loyal to the company’s popular brands even when they are competing with generic or house brands.\n\nPG stock is up about 66% in the last five years. Some years (2020 and 2021) have been great. In 2022, not so much. The average gain of about 13% stock price growth every year is not going to beat the markets in many years, but P&G is still a reliable, long-term investment.\n\nAnd even in the years when the stock doesn’t perform as well, the stock has a solid, and growing dividend. P&G is part of the exclusive Dividend Kings club having increased its dividend for 68 consecutive years.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) Verizon Retail Location. Verizon delivers wireless, high-capacity fiber optics and 5G communications. VZ stock\n\nSource: RAMAN SHAUNIA / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is proof that boring can be beautiful. The wireless business is a tough business model in the best of times. But it’s also a reliable business model. And with about 28% of market share, investors can count on consistency quarter after quarter.\n\nVZ stock is down about 25% in the last five years. Much of that has been because the company was spending money to build out its 5G infrastructure. But analysts bidding up the stock is a good sign that investors are betting that the company is about finished with that spending. That should allow for stock price appreciation in the coming years.\n\nThat stock price growth will pair nicely with a juicy dividend that currently has a yield of over 6% and the company has increased that dividend in each of the last 19 years. With the company’s cash flow likely to increase in coming years, more dividend growth is a near certainty.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company substantially increased its operating capacity by adding 27 megawatts, reaching a total of 234 megawatts, and another 6 megawatts in October 2023, reaching 240 megawatts. Bitfarms is ambitiously expanding its mining capacity, aiming to achieve a hash rate of 17EH/s by the second half of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, the company aims to eliminate its debt by February 2024, ending the previous year with $84 million in cash and only 4 million in debt.

        "content": "AI is now a part of our lives: regulators are looking to keep tabs on the biggest players, the tech titans are now looking to make money from it, and we’re all still wondering – is it the end of civilization as we know it? Who’s going to get there first on meaningful regulation? Who are the biggest AI players you haven’t thought of yet? Will legal battles squash innovation, or open it up? Yahoo Finance caught up with experts across the industry to answer these questions and more as part of its weekly series The AI Revolution. Here are some of the best moments.\n\nWhere are we now? (00:00:05)\n\nYahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley discussed Nvidia's (NVDA) AI advancements, competitors Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and where the AI race will go moving forward. \"Nvidia is the AI king. They eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap in June,\" Howley said. \"The big ones (rivals) really are AMD, which has been a long-time thorn in their side, and Intel.\"\n\nRadio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor discussed the outlook for generative AI adoption and corporate valuations. Windsor explained, \"There is a big use case for artificial intelligence, yes. It's just not worth the valuations that people are ascribing to them because they think the prices are going to be much higher than they really are.\"\n\nFinding a referee (00:00:46)\n\nYahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan broke down global AI regulation policies—comparing how different countries are setting up different rules for AI. Keenan said, \"The deep fakes, these are one of the major risks that IP lawyers, tech lawyers talk about ... Also, AI that impacts government infrastructure, that's another big area of concern.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Ca.) is a part of the bipartisan effort introducing the Federal Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Act to Congress, which aims to provide AI regulatory guidelines. Rep. Lieu explained, \"What this bill does is it mandates that the standards set forth by the (National) Institute of Standards and Technology be applied to both the Federal government as well as any companies that want to contract with the Federal government.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTom Davenport, Babson College President’s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management, discussed the adoption of AI and AI regulation across the globe. Davenport said, \"A lot of potential opportunity. The biggest barrier now is in the data and how organizations get their data ready for generative AI.\"\n\nMonetizing AI (00:01:37)\n\nAI Now Institute Co-Founder and Chief Advisor Meredith Whittaker broke down the recent tech sector layoffs and restructurings that have been fueled by AI. Whittaker said, \"I think what we need is to see increased union density, so workers have more leverage over deciding where AI is introduced and how it's used.\"\n\nBoosted.ai Co-Founder and CEO Joshua Pantony highlighted the benefits of using generative AI models for investing, and how it is different from past generations of investing programs. Pantony explained, \"If you use a system like ours, you're going to be able to learn information a lot faster. And the other side is really around efficiency of your process.\"\n\nLegal woes (00:02:14)\n\nRyan Abbott, Brown Neri Smith & Khan, LLP Partner, broke down legal precedents surrounding AI including patent and copyright infringement laws. \"What we're fundamentally seeing is this new sort of activity where you have machines that are behaving like people, and legal systems that were designed with human centric concepts,\" Abbott said. \"A company like Novo Nordisk (NVO) uses AI to develop Wegovy or Ozempic, can they patent something like that, or do you need a traditional human inventor?\"\n\nAccenture (ACN) Chief Technology Officer Paul Daugherty discussed AI data and the ways workplace AI may effectively be incorporated into many business models to benefit workers. Daugherty explained, \"There hasn't been anything like generative AI ... it is different. The reason is one, the speed ... the second is this human-like nature of the technology. And as a result of that, it changes everything that people do.\"\n\nElection risk (00:02:59)\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman broke down how AI will impact the U.S. Presidential election in 2024 and what Americans need to be on the lookout for. Newman said, \"Disinformation in elections is not new ... so I think what's going to be new in 2024 is just the sophistication of the bogus information. It's a lot easier to use AI to do fake videos that look like real people, fake audio recordings.\"\n\nGenerative AI speaker and advisor Nina Schick discussed the political ramifications to come from the AI boom. Schick explained, \"When people start to understand that anything can be synthetic, anything can be AI generated, anything can be faked, they begin to lose trust in everything. And I think that is one of the core challenges we're facing.\"\n\nVideo highlights:\n\n00:00:05 - Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley\n\n00:00:26 - Radio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor\n\n00:00:46 - Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan\n\n00:01:04 - U.S. Rep.

        "content": "Constructing a portfolio takes a lot of time and effort. It’s even more tedious to craft a portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.\n\nSome investors seek to grow their portfolios by as much as possible. They are willing to take risks but don’t want to take on speculative investments. Distinguishing between those types of assets can help investors realize higher returns in the long run.\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (DRCT) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nDirect Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:DRCT) looks like a hidden gem due to its low market cap and rapid growth. The advertising company has a $140 million market cap and a 32 P/E ratio. The firm is valued at a 14-forward P/E ratio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDirect Digital Holdings specializes in programmatic advertising. The company offers solutions to the buy and sell side of the digital advertising industry. However, the sell side is where most of the growth resides. The firm has many clients in multiple industries and places an emphasis on small and medium-sized businesses generating $5 million to $500 million in revenue.\n\nRevenue and earnings growth have soared in recent quarters which makes this micro-cap stock look enticing. Revenue surged by 129% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2023. Net income outpaced revenue growth with a 313% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe company offered guidance ranging from $170 million to $190 million in fiscal year 2023 revenue. The midpoint represents a 101% year-over-year revenue increase. Sell-side advertising drives this growth with 174% year-over-year revenue growth. The buy-side advertising segment only grew by 10% year-over-year. A low valuation combined with hyper-growth makes DRCT enticing.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

Momentum Stocks.\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is an SEO software that helps businesses discover optimal keywords and various opportunities to rank higher on search engines.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and other search engines can drive considerable traffic to a company’s website. Some corporations pay millions of dollars each year to ensure their content gets in front of more people.\n\nSemrush is a convenient tool with a monthly subscription plan. This revenue model has helped the company achieve $322.8 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nThe company’s growing subscription business resulted in a 20% year-over-year growth in revenue. GAAP net income reached $4.2 million which is significant progress for a company that had been unprofitable for a while.\n\nProfit margins are likely to expand in the upcoming quarters. Higher profit margins will result in a lower valuation and give the stock more room to run. Shares have gained 47% over the past year. Shares are still more than 60% down from their all-time high, but the stock can reclaim that level in a few years.\n\nWingstop (WING)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWingstop (NASDAQ:WING) is a rising fast food restaurant stock that has gained 318% over the past five years. The fast food chain started in Texas back in 1994 and now has almost 2,000 global locations.\n\nThe company has a long record of growth. Wingstop has 19 consecutive years of same-store sales growth and is likely to reach 20+ consecutive years. Domestic sale store sales increased by 15.3% year-over-year to support 26.4% year-over-year overall revenue growth.\n\nThat wasn’t the only great news surrounding the fiscal third quarter of 2023. Digital sales have been a big growth driver and surged by 66.9% year-over-year. Net income also jumped by 46% year-over-year which means the net profit margin is expanding.\n\nLeadership has a long-term vision of scaling Wingstop into a Top 10 Global Restaurant Brand. The firm closed out the third quarter with 53 new net openings which will introduce more customers to the brand.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a high-growth educational app that helps people master new languages and various school subjects. New users are flocking to the app based on the company’s 63% year-over-year growth in daily active users in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe strong user base also resulted in 43% year-over-year revenue growth and raised its full-year guidance. Luis von Ahn, co-founder and CEO of Duolingo, expressed optimism about offering new subjects outside of language learning.\n\nDuolingo was downgraded recently due to the threat of artificial intelligence. However, this fear is overblown. Artificial intelligence is a complementary resource rather than an uprooter.\n\nSpeculators believed artificial intelligence would replace writers last year, but many publications are pulling back or banning the use of AI tools. Similarly, there has been speculation about autonomous trucks replacing drivers, but this seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nInvestors shouldn’t be worried about artificial intelligence hurting Duolingo’s business model. The firm recently became profitable and is growing at a nice pace. Pressure from the downgrade presents a buying opportunity.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet has been a consistent winner over many years. Shares are up by 46% over the past year and have gained 171% over the past five years.\n\nAdvertising is the company’s main revenue stream. Revenue in this segment has picked up in recent quarters, and lower interest rates can signal higher ad revenue in the future. The firm’s cost-cutting measures can result in more profits combined with heightened revenue growth.\n\nAlphabet is continuing its layoff saga which included its Moonshot division. This segment is focused on innovative ideas that can become viable business models but burn cash at the moment. Alphabet is turning to outside investors to fund its ventures.\n\nAlphabet also has its Google Cloud business segment which recently became profitable and continues to deliver exceptional growth. Google Cloud achieved 22,5% year-over-year revenue growth while the business as a whole grew revenue by 11% year-over-year. Alphabet can continue to march higher despite having a market cap above $1 trillion.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another trillion-dollar company that looks ready to generate more returns for investors. The AI leader is off to a strong start with a 24% year-to-date gain. Shares have gained 211% over the past year and are up by 1,390% over the past five years.\n\nThe scorching demand for artificial intelligence helped Nvidia increase revenue by 206% year-over-year. Net income increased by more than 1,200% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. These growth rates have helped Nvidia maintain a reasonable valuation.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been thrown into the spotlight due to artificial intelligence, the tech conglomerate has multiple high-growth business segments. Its gaming segment increased revenue by 81% year-over-year. Revenue from the professional visualization segment is up by 108% year-over-year. Both segments also achieved double-digit sequential growth.\n\nWhile professional visualization represents a small but growing portion of Nvidia’s revenue, the gaming segment brings in more than 15% of the corporation’s total revenue. Nvidia isn’t only an artificial intelligence play, but that vertical has allowed the company to experience record-breaking growth.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a leading cybersecurity company that is significantly ramping up its net profit margins.

That translates into an 871% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nRevenue held strong with 20% year-over-year growth while remaining performance obligations jumped by 26% year-over-year.\n\nCyber attacks are on the rise, and more businesses are turning to companies like Palo Alto Networks for help. Many investors see the opportunity and bid up PANW 394% higher over the past five years. Shares are up by 131% over the past year.\n\nPalo Alto Networks’ valuation will become more reasonable as the company reports high year-over-year net income growth. This net income expansion is a big payoff for long-term investors.\n\nDipak Golechha, Chief Financial Officer of Palo Alto Networks, cited a high cost of money impacting the company’s billings. Lower interest rates should act as a tailwind for the company’s billings and lead to a higher share price.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in DRCT, DUOL, and NVDA.

        "content": "(Adds comments by U.S. Commerce secretary, background, comment by tech industry trade group, paragraphs 5-9, 11-12)\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is proposing requiring U.S. cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities are accessing U.S. data centers to train AI models, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Friday.\n\n\"We can't have non-state actors or China or folks who we don’t want accessing our cloud to train their models,\" Raimondo said in an interview with Reuters. \"We use export controls on chips,\" she noted. \"Those chips are in American cloud data centers so we also have to think about closing down that avenue for potential malicious activity.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is taking a series of measures to prevent China from using U.S. technology for artificial intelligence, as the burgeoning sector raises security concerns.\n\nThe proposed \"know your customer\" regulation was released on Friday for public inspection and will be published on Monday. \"It is a big deal,\" Raimondo said.\n\nThe United States is \"trying as hard as we can to deny China the compute power that they want to train their own (AI) models, but what good is that if they go around that to use our cloud to train their models?\" she said.\n\nLast month, Raimondo said Commerce would not allow Nvidia \"to ship is the most sophisticated, highest-processing-power AI chips, which would enable China to train their frontier models.\"\n\nThe U.S. government is worried about China developing advanced AI systems on a variety of national security grounds and has taken steps to stop Beijing from receiving cutting-edge U.S. technologies to strengthen its military.\n\nThe proposal would require U.S. cloud computing companies to verify the identity of foreign persons who sign up for or maintain accounts that utilize U.S. cloud computing through a \"know-your-customer program or Customer Identification Program.\" It would also set minimum standards for identifying foreign users and would require cloud computing firms to certify compliance annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nRaimondo said U.S. cloud computing companies \"should have the burden of knowing who their biggest customers are training the biggest models, and we're trying to get that information. What will we do with that information? It depends on what we find.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden in October signed an executive order requiring developers of AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the results of safety tests with the U.S. government before they are released to the public.\n\nThe Commerce Department plans to soon send those survey requests to companies. Raimondo told Reuters companies will have 30 days to respond. \"Any company that doesn't want to comply is a red flag for me,\" she said.\n\nCarl Szabo, general counsel at NetChoice, a tech industry trade group, said Commerce is implementing Biden's \"illegal\" executive order \"to force industry reporting requirements for AI.\" He added that requiring U.S. cloud companies to report use of their resources by non-U.S. entities \"for training large language models could deter international collaboration.\"\n\nTop cloud providers include Amazon.com's AWS, Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure unit.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Editing by Leslie Adler and Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's message to investors dumping the stock after a tepid first quarter outlook: stay the course — the turnaround that gained steam in 2023 hasn't stalled.\n\n\"It's an overreaction,\" Gelsinger said on Yahoo Finance Live of the sharp market reaction on Friday to Intel's disappointing first quarter guidance the night before.\n\nShares of the chip giant plunged 11% — with the stock a top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance — as Intel said it would see near-term sales and profit challenges in areas such as its data center and Mobileye businesses.\n\nGelsinger believes those issues will abate in the second quarter as Intel unleashes a host of new chips to support AI workloads and hardware.\n\nWall Street isn't so sure.\n\n\"The main reason they guided so poorly was their \"growth businesses\" are not growing, and in fact, they're contracting,\" Citi analyst Christopher Danely told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nGelsinger said that Intel expects to see 40 million shipments of AI PCs in 2024, and all of the company's planned chip launches for the year remain on track.\n\nIntel recently showcased a range of AI-focused products and services. On display was Gaudi3, an artificial intelligence chip for generative AI software that will become available later this year.\n\nThe company has also unveiled its Core Ultra processor, which will target the aforementioned emerging AI PC market.\n\nGelsinger added he has a line of sight into $10 billion in orders for Intel's new foundry business. The business is set up to be a consistent money-maker for Intel beginning in 2025, contends Gelsinger.\n\nDespite the green shoots in the quarter, Wall Street is largely sticking with the view Intel is a show-me investment story.\n\n\"Overall, we are seeing continued solid execution by the team, compute fundamentals continue gradually improving, and although we continue to be impressed by the current execution, the next 12 months will be the most difficult for the team as they will be launching two datacenter products and two major client products over three new manufacturing technology nodes,\" said JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur in a client note reviewed by Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nSur reiterated an underweight rating on Intel's stock with a $37 price target, about 16% lower than current levels. Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel, responds to a question during a keynote conversation at CES 2024.

        "title": "The Top 3 Stocks to Sell Before They Tank in 2024",
        "content": "Finding stocks to sell in 2024 isn’t hard, but actually executing is another matter. For example, bearish sentiment abounds around the Magnificent Seven as the S&P 500 hits all-time highs despite sweeping tech layoffs and overall economic unease. And sure, you could short a stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on the grounds of massive overvaluation. But ask the thousands of traders who thought the same over the past year as the stock consistently climbed higher how that works out.\n\nInstead, if you’re looking for stocks to sell in 2024, find those materially overvalued and facing stronger headwinds than others in the market or specific sector. These three strong cover sectors as diverse as financial services, auto manufacturing and apparel. The one thing they have in common? They’re at the top of the list of stocks to sell in 2024.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM) Affirm financial stocks to sell\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAffirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) is on a hot streak, returning more than 180% over the past year. But hot streaks must end, and the inherent weakness in AFRM’s model makes it a top stock to sell in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou likely know that Affirm’s bread-and-butter is its buy now, pay later model. This financing option is effectively a short-term micro-loan extended to consumers at a point of sale. But, for better or worse, consumers flocking to BNPL solutions tend to be less than creditworthy. And, with credit card delinquency rates skyrocketing, it’s only a matter of time before Affirm’s BNPL loans go unpaid en masse.\n\nIn its most recent filing, a look at Affirm’s balance sheet shows that its allowance for credit losses (expected delinquency write-offs) jumped more than 10% year-over-year. And that’s before the holiday sales season, where countless consumers doubtlessly extended their credit card limits and leaned on Affirm’s BNPL offerings. Overall, consumer and macroeconomic trends don’t point to good things ahead for Affirm in the short term, making it one of the top stocks to sell today.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla(TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nI hate to say it, but after this week’s earnings, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is near the top of the list of stocks to sell in 2024. Musk is correct that Tesla is more than a car company. Its emergent AI and robotics sectors could prove winners in the long run. But that’s the future, and today’s focus needs to emphasize the viability of electric vehicles in a changing economic landscape.\n\nRapid price cutting led to slimmer margins throughout 2023, which, combined with falling EV demand, spells trouble for Tesla in 2024. This is nothing new, of course. This week’s earnings report made it abundantly clear that, in the words of Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, “Tesla is signaling that the days of 50% or even 30% to 40% growth year-over-year is not going to happen in 2024.”\n\nTesla already fell quite a bit this week, down 26% since January 1st at last count. If you’re sitting on sizeable gains from Tesla and don’t mind the tax hit, there are better ways to deploy your capital in 2024. If you think this is a buying opportunity, beware of trying to catch a falling knife. For now, the best bet is to keep your Tesla exposure limited to its weight in a standard index ETF like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) and consider it a stock to sell otherwise.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) stock hasn’t kept pace with wider markets, losing more than 20% over the past year. Despite the underperformance, shares still trade well over fair value at nearly 30x earnings and 11x book value. And that’s on the heels of an abysmal December earnings report that included a weak 1% growth target and plans to cut more than $2 billion in overall costs.\n\nMany of those cuts will likely come from payroll, which presents its own problems. Indicators point to Nike paying as much as $450 million in severance over the next few years as part of sweeping layoffs to save money long-term. But, as we’re seeing more and more, mass layoffs tend to be a harbinger of worse things to come.\n\nConsumers aren’t as enamored with Nike products as they once were, as affordable alternatives abound and tightened household budgets prevent overspending on luxury sports apparel that comprise Nike’s core offering. A possible next step—value pricing—might prove the final nail in Nike’s coffin as it gives up brand clout for a quick payday.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "5 Timeless Investing Principles Reaffirmed",
        "content": "If you want to be successful as an investor, designing, using, and refining a process is just about the most important consideration.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest ways to build an investing process is to define your principles. Principles allow you to codify and standardize your decision-making, which is critical as an investor. When things are going very well or very poorly, it can be easy to get carried away by your emotions, but principles can help to always keep you grounded.\r\n\r\nNow, in my tenth year as a trader, the market still manages to surprise me day after day. As investors, we must always be learning from our mistakes and fine-tuning our methodology because there is no end goal, just a constantly evolving process. If you love the process and learning, you can do well in markets.\r\n\r\nNow that we have moved on to 2024, it can be useful to reflect on the last year of trading so we can identify what worked and what didn’t. Falling back on the most basic principles should allow us to have success in bull markets and bears.\r\n\r\nPrice Action Over Economic Forecasts \r\n\r\nWant to hear something crazy? The S&P 500 never traded below the low of the first day of the year. That means the stock index never went negative YTD once! Despite widespread forecasts for a recession and market downturn, 2023 defied predictions and emerged as a banner year.\r\n\r\nWhile the economists were referring to their models, they forgot about the best economic forecasting tool in the world, the market itself. Because the stock market is a forward discounting mechanism, it is almost always doing a better job at discounting future risks than any individual analyst or trader.\r\n\r\nNow, a few weeks into the new year, stock indexes are pushing into new all-time highs and carving out a clear upward trend. Until the price confirms otherwise, that should be considered bullish!\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the trend can’t change, and I would encourage investors to use one of many measures of trend, but until it proves otherwise, stick with it.\r\n\r\nThis is why it is so important to really listen to what the price tells you and try to read through the most popular narratives swirling around the market. The price action tells you everything you need to know.\r\n\r\nContinued . . .\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUltimate Access Is Only $1\r\n\r\nSee all the private trades hidden from the public on Zacks.com. These trades are produced by the system that's more than doubled the S&P 500 since 1988 with a whopping average gain of +24.0% per year.\r\n\r\nStarting today, for one month, you can follow these exclusive portfolios in real time from value to income . . . from best stocks under $10 to insider trades to companies that are about to report earnings (we've predicted positive surprises with over 80% accuracy). And more.\r\n\r\nTotal cost $1, and not a cent of further obligation.\r\n\r\nThis special opportunity ends at midnight Sunday, January 28.\r\n\r\nSee the Trades Now >> \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow the Big Trends \r\n\r\nEvery year, there are often one or two big trends or narratives that carry a stock or sector to massive outperformance. In 2023, it was Artificial Intelligence. As soon as ChatGPT was released, and investors began to grasp how many data center products Nvidia was going to be selling, the monster trend set off, and barely took a breath all year.\r\n\r\nLooking back another year, in 2022, energy and especially oil and gas were leaders throughout the year, providing huge opportunities for outperformance.\r\n\r\nThey aren’t always immediately clear, but if you watch closely, the big themes usually become evident by Q2 and definitely by the second half of the year.\r\n\r\nSince the time of this writing, we are only a few weeks into the year, so I’m not yet sure what the big trend will be, but I am going to keep my ear to the ground.\r\n\r\nI will also add that this Artificial Intelligence boom has the potential to carry the market higher for a second year. Its influence on the economy and stock market is reminiscent of the early Internet boom, which proceeded for several years.\r\n\r\nBut you shouldn’t stop there – I know there will be at least one more big idea that carries a sector far and above the rest of the market.\r\n\r\nInvest in What You Know \r\n\r\nMany commentators on the internet often say retail investors looking for alpha should focus on micro and small-cap stocks if they want an edge. However, I wholeheartedly disagree. I personally have always been one to closely follow large and mega-cap stocks because I think they are fantastic businesses with many more years of growth.\r\n\r\nAnd it paid off! I was prepared to own big tech stocks in 2023, and many returned more than 100%.\r\n\r\nNvidia and Meta Platforms, two of the largest companies in the world, were the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. The setups were quite compelling, with Meta Platforms ending 2023 at its lowest relative valuation in a decade and Nvidia leading the Artificial Intelligence revolution.\r\n\r\nBoth stocks were steadily trending higher, confirming bullish price action all year.\r\n\r\nFollow the stocks you know and understand, and when the opportunity to own them presents itself, you will be more ready and confident than other investors.\r\n\r\nUtilizing the Zacks Rank \r\n\r\nThis is my first year at Zacks and my first time using the proprietary tools. I was constantly impressed with how effective they were at anticipating which stocks would be the top performers.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, I have gone through many different filtering and signal generation tools, and the Zacks Rank has easily been one of, if not the simplest and most effective, for identifying winning stocks.\r\n\r\nFor example, Nvidia and Meta Platforms enjoyed Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings for many months and sat atop the list right from the beginning of the year. Because the Zacks Rank aggregates the earnings estimates and revisions from all analysts on Wall Street, it provides a broad opinion on expectations, like the way the market functions.\r\n\r\nAs earnings estimates trend higher, institutional traders begin buying the stock, thus pushing it higher. I’ve carefully reviewed the earnings estimate trend of META. Following the upgrades in February, the stocks rallied higher all year.\r\n\r\nRisk Management \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, risk management should always be the number one concern of investors. As always, the first goal is not to lose money. Don’t focus on how much you can make; focus on how much you may lose.\r\n\r\nThe calculation for risk management should be simple. After entering a stock, identify the level where you think the thesis is wrong. This is where you place a stop loss. You should be sizing your positions as a function of this amount.\r\n\r\nSay you have 10% of your portfolio in a stock, and your stop loss is -10% below the current price. If you get stopped out, you will lose a total of 1% of your portfolio. Do this for every position in your portfolio and you will know the max drawdown of all your current positions.\r\n\r\nEven the best traders are wrong on nearly half of their trades, so we must get used to taking losses. It is just the cost of business. However, the focus should be on maximizing how much you make when you are right and minimizing how much you lose when you are wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you are doing your research correctly and making the right decision, the returns will take care of themselves. 2023 made it extremely clear that no investor needs margin – there were half a dozen large-cap stocks that more than doubled last year!\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts \r\n\r\nOf course, hindsight is 20/20, and though Meta Platforms and Nvidia were top Zacks Rank stocks, many investors doubted they would continue to trade higher all year. Although it isn’t a new insight, good trading requires courage. You must form your opinion and stick to it, even if that goes against the herd.\r\n\r\nHowever, utilizing each of the principles listed above should aid in doing good research and thinking independently. Filter and identify stocks through the Zacks Rank, follow the price action on each stock, and the market to identify the trend, understand the businesses you are investing in, and try to ride the major thematic waves influencing the market.\r\n\r\nIf you can do all of this, while remaining strict with your position sizing, stop losses and risk management, you will have great investing success in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe Easiest Way To Harness the Predictive Power of the Zacks Rank\r\n\r\nToday I'm pleased to offer you full 30-day, real-time access to ALL our private buys & sells as part of our celebrated Zacks Ultimate service. \r\n\r\nTotal cost $1, and not 1 cent of further obligation.\r\n\r\nAll of our portfolios are grounded in Zacks Rank fundamentals.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +24.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 19.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.49 per share, indicating a change of +410.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.31 points to a change of +268.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.07 indicates a change of +63.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $20.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +232.2%. The $58.92 billion and $90.57 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +118.4% and +53.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +205.5%. EPS of $4.02 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.9%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks",
        "content": "In the last 10 years, Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) has experienced an annual average price return of around 19%, with a median dividend yield of 1.43%. That puts the total investment return at around 20% as an annual average over that period. I expect these returns are quite likely to continue, especially considering favorable future revenue estimates. The largest fundamental risk for the company seems to be its balance sheet.\n\n2024 operations updates\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nOn Jan. 16, Oracle released its first quarterly Critical Patch Update, or CPU, of the year. It addressed an important set of vulnerabilities across its product families. Around 389 new security patches are included, which target 191 common vulnerabilities and exposures, or CVEs. Thirty-seven of the patches are considered critical, focusing on fixing severe security risks.\n\nThe company's Financial Services Applications received 71 new security patches. Oracle Communications received 55 patches and Oracle Fusion Middleware received 40 patches. The CPU also addresses potential security weaknesses in MySQL, Java SE and the E-Business Suite.\n\nThese updates are crucial at a time when advanced technology companies like Oracle are expanding and adapting toward artificial intelligence and facing a range of threats from criminal organizations that are also utilizing such technologies. The updates should maintain the company's market position and keep clients' trust after a difficult period of heightened cybercrime. By 2025, worldwide cybercrime costs are estimated to reach a staggering $10.5 trillion annually, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.\n\nThe company's investments in advanced technology seem to be paying off, driving revenue growth and positioning it well in the cloud services industry. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Oracle reported a year-over-year total revenue increase of 9%. In the second quarter, it reported a year-over-year total revenue increase of 5%. The growth in the second quarter was largely driven by a 25% surge in cloud revenue, both IaaS and SaaS. The company has also been aggressively expanding into cloud data centers. Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison has noted that this reflects Oracle's commitment to high demand for cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial analysis\n\nOracle has particularly strong earnings growth as opposed to revenue growth historically. The chart below shows around a decade of plateaued revenue growth, which has now begun to increase. The second chart shows reliable earnings per share without non-recurring items growth over the last decade, albeit with periods of volatility. Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks\n\nBecause the company has focused on high-margin products, including databases and enterprise software, this can support earnings growth even when revenue increases are lacking. Oracle's continued shift toward cloud computing services is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the future. The recurring revenue model associated with cloud services leads to steady and predictable revenue streams that could contribute to maintaining around 20% annual total investment returns for shareholders over the next decade.\n\nOracle has a high net margin compared to its industry peers. At 19.64%, the major competitors that beat it on this metric are Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) at 27.97%, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) at 21.05% and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) at 22.25%. However, this should not undermine the company's strength in this area, as its net margin is ranked better than 90.93% of companies in the software industry, according to GuruFocus.\n\nTo help drive net margin growth, the company has been focusing on artificial intelligence, specifically through its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or OCI. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other leaders in the field have endorsed OCI's GPU clusters for AI infrastructure, reflecting strength in the area. In addition, Oracle is forming partnerships to focus on private and secure AI cloud services, which should further drive top-line growth and, more significantly, make it more efficient, creating further opportunities for net margin expansion.\n\nOracle has a strong record of repurchasing stock, doing so every single year on record since 2008. While its repurchasing rates have varied from under $1 billion in 2010 to $36.64 billion in 2019, the continuous effect of such financial management is highly beneficial for shareholders who are interested in price returns from the stock as opposed to dividends.\n\nValuation\n\nOracle does seem highly valued at the moment. Even with the GF Value line showing it to be fairly valued, I think the stock's valuation is a risk that investors need to consider. Oracle's 20% Returns Could Continue Despite Balance Sheet Risks\n\nIt has a price-earnings ratio of around 30.50 and a forward price-earnings ratio of around 20, which is more or less average for the industry it is in. However, if there is any slowdown in growth due to regulatory pressures surrounding its cloud infrastructure and AI services, the stock could see unwarranted volatility. This is true insofar as these regulatory risks are not already priced in. My perspective is they are not fully accounted for, leading to a potential slight overvaluation in the stock at present.\n\nTo get some perspective on the company's price-earnings ratio relative to its major industry peers, Adobe has a forward ratio of around 34, Synopsys of around 37 and Fortinet of around 37.\n\nBalance sheet and competitive risks\n\nOracle's balance sheet is one of the largest risks for the stock as its total liabilities have risen from 43.71% of assets in 2012 to 96.74% in the last trailing 12 months. Around 61.39% of assets are balanced by long-term debt right now, and the company issues debt on a regular basis, with only two years of no issuance since 2015. However, its cash flow from financing is usually negative due to the regular repurchase of common stock. I think this shows a financial management team far more focused on growth than the balance sheet; my only concern with this strategy is that too far an overextension could result in more moderate growth long term as a matter of equilibrium. The company might find itself needing to divert its resources to servicing debt, leaving less available for growth strategies and shareholder returns. During a severe economic crisis, the company's current level of debt would make it less agile to deal with the challenges.\n\nThe company is also going to face significant competition in cloud infrastructure, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Compute Engine. These companies have IaaS offerings and cloud solutions like private servers, bare metal servers and cloud-based object storage services. AWS is known for its extensive range of options, like EC2 and CloudFormation, providing security and tailorable compute capacity and resource management. Microsoft Azure has a global network of data centers and strong scaling capacity, while Google Compute Engine has notable security benefits and elastic load balancing.\n\nThe competition in these areas is fierce, and whether Oracle will be a dominant player is yet to be seen in many respects. It remains positioned for continued growth, but like all of the major organizations working in artificial intelligence and cloud solutions, specific niches are integral to maintaining market share.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Oracle is a buy for me. Whether the company's annual stock returns will average at around 20% over the next decade is speculative, but the company is positioned operationally to have strong performance ahead. However, the balance sheet and competition risks, in particular, make me skeptical about allocating a large amount to the investment. I feel less confident investing in Oracle than I do in Microsoft and Google, yet the stock remains on my watchlist for when I next allocate to the technology section of my portfolio.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "With the Markets At All-Time Highs, Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "Although it's only been a few weeks into the new year, 2024 has gotten off to a hot start. Optimistic sentiment surrounding the macroeconomy, coupled with surging demand in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), has helped push the market to new highs.\n\nIn particular, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have all played a role in pushing the S&P 500 higher during the past year. As the index continues to climb, one stock in particular seems to be moving in tandem.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is already up more than 20% year to date. With both Nvidia stock and the S&P 500 hovering around all-time highs, investors may be wondering if it's too late to get in on the action.\n\nLet's explore the dynamics of the capital markets and assess whether scooping up shares of Nvidia stock makes sense right now.\n\nEmploy a buy-and-hold mindset\n\nOne of the most tempting things to do when investing is to sell a stock. Whether one of your positions rockets higher or drops off a cliff, it's easy for emotions to take over and convince yourself that moving on is the optimal strategy. While this can be the case at times, it's paramount to ask yourself \"why\" when you're considering selling.\n\nWith this in mind, investors might wonder whether buying shares in Nvidia makes sense right now. After all, the company clearly has a fair amount of momentum pushing it higher.\n\nAlthough market returns vary from year to year, the long-term performance of the S&P 500 makes one thing in particular very clear: Holding over the course of several years (even decades) has helped many people build generational wealth. The underlying thesis here is that the market tends to showcase its resiliency over a long-term time horizon.\n\nThis dynamic underscores the old investing adage that spending time in the market is far more important than timing the market. Warren Buffett has even said: \"If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes.\"\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs Nvidia stock attractive right now?\n\nWhen assessing Nvidia stock, it is important to first understand why the stock is enjoying such pronounced buying activity.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's semiconductor chips is off the charts. The company's chips are used to train generative AI models -- and the market for AI chips is expected to double in just the next three years.\n\nWhile the company's revenue and profits are soaring, Nvidia stock has risen well over 200% in just the past year. In fact, the company is now the sixth most valuable company in the world by market cap. Given its surging stock price and $1.5 trillion valuation, it might appear that Nvidia is expensive and buying now could be a hasty move. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIndeed, Nvidia's revenue, operating profit, and free cash flow are all increasing at an unprecedented pace. Although some investors may be wary of these growth rates, both the company's projections and Wall Street analysts' estimates call for further acceleration. So while the image of a valuation of more than $1 trillion might make a stock appear expensive, there is an argument to be made that Nvidia is actually cheap.\n\nAs of the time of this article, Nvidia stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 31. In comparison, the company's biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, trades at a forward P/E of 48. While the prospects of AMD's MI300X accelerators look encouraging, the company still trails Nvidia's overall position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market by a considerable margin. Moreover, AMD's revenue and profitability profile are nowhere near Nvidia's right now.\n\nSo even though the stock is hovering around its highs, valuation analysis suggests that now could be a unique opportunity to scoop up shares at a discount relative to the competition. Furthermore, long-term themes in the overall market support holding Nvidia stock for several years.\n\nIt's important for investors to understand that the AI market is still unfolding. But I see Nvidia as well-positioned to benefit from the trends fueling artificial intelligence for years to come. I think now is a great opportunity to begin building a long-term position by employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Intel tumbles on dismal forecast, weak PC chip demand",
        "content": "By Samrhitha A\n\n(Reuters) - Intel slumped nearly 12% on Friday reeling from a bleak first-quarter revenue outlook as the chipmaker struggles to navigate uncertain demand in traditional computing markets and attempts to play catch up in the AI race.\n\nThe chipmaker was set to lose about $25 billion in market value, if premarket losses hold, based on its share price of $43.65. Its stock had soared 90% in 2023.\n\nAnalysts say that while plenty of businesses in the chip sector have been bullish lately, Intel becomes the exception on concerns that the company is late to the competition in data center AI.\n\nSales have been slowing in the PC and laptop processing chip market, which is Intel's bread and butter, said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\"There is a danger Intel is being left behind as chips from the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices play an increasingly important role in the data-hungry AI industry,\" Mould added.\n\nThe forecast was worse than feared, that current-quarter revenue could miss market estimates by more than $2 billion. Adjusted profit forecast of 13 cents a share also fell short of expectations.\n\nIntel is not yet competitive in the market for AI-specific chips, but the company's central processing units (CPUs) are often used in conjunction with Nvidia's AI chips, with a third of Intel's server CPUs now sold as part of AI systems.\n\n\"Although Intel beat (Q4 revenue) estimates, investors' disappointment in Intel's Data Center GPU story's growth can be primarily attributed to the slower-than-expected product delivery and ramp-up,\" said Lucas Keh, semiconductors analyst at Third Bridge.\n\nThe gloomy forecast from one of the largest suppliers of PC chips by market share dampened hopes of the PC market recovering, sending shares of other chipmakers lower premarket.\n\nNvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm and Micron Technology were down between 1% and 2.5%.\n\nThe company's stock trades at about 28 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with 45.08 for AMD and nearly 30 for Nvidia, Intel's peers in the sector, according to LSEG data.\n\n(Reporting by Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)",

        "content": "According to the International Monetary Fund, we are on the brink of a technology revolution spearheaded by artificial intelligence. The technology will boost productivity, accelerate global growth and raise incomes globally. Multiple AI stocks will benefit from this transformation.\n\nToday, businesses are analyzing how they can leverage AI to improve productivity and how it affects the competitive landscape. Already, organizations are using AI in various use cases, such as application development, customer service, pharmaceutical discovery and creative design.\n\nHowever, to achieve the promise of AI, companies must make significant investments. That starts with the data and models they use. First, organizations are investing in systems to collect, store, manage and access massive data sets. Then, using the right models, they can derive patterns from their data to drive decision-making, customer service and innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAcross the artificial intelligence stack, several companies are meeting various needs. From chip companies producing chips for training large language models to companies developing large language models. These AI stocks are at the forefront of this race and will be winners in 2024.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the largest semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the leading AI stocks. The company is seeing soaring demand as the scramble for AI chips for data centers and edge computing grows. Over the years, many integrated device manufacturers transitioned to fabless designers, cementing Taiwan Semiconductor’s importance in chip production.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has built an unassailable competitive advantage in its process technology. By investing heavily in research and development, it has maintained leadership in node advancement. As a result, it attracts and retains high-quality, fabless customers. For instance, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in mobile chips and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphic processing units.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, the company is producing leading-edge node chips for its AI customers. Competitors have had challenges producing these chips, enabling Taiwan Semi to dominate the market and charge higher prices. Already the firm is producing 3-nanometer chips for Nvidia, Apple and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as competitors struggle to catch up.\n\nOn January 19, the company released results and issued upbeat guidance. The company is benefitting from cloud service providers upgrading their data centers with chips supporting AI capabilities. Management was optimistic on high-performance computing demand related to AI, forecasting more than 20% revenue growth in 2024.\n\nWhile AI adoption has been mainly in the data center, it will become ubiquitous, supporting Taiwan Semi’s growth. Consumer devices such as smartphones and industrial equipment will need AI capabilities, ushering in the next growth cycle.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it is primarily a social media company, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a player in the AI for a while. Its increased efforts in the field came out of necessity after Apple’s IDFA changes curtailed user tracking. Faced with diminished advertising accuracy, Meta Platforms pivoted to AI.\n\nTwo years later, the company has become one of the top AI stocks. Notably, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has touted AI as “the foundation of our discovery engine and our ads business.” The company has amassed hundreds of top A.I. researchers and invested in significant computer power to power these systems. These efforts are paying off with impressive results.\n\nIn February 2023, it released LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) a foundational large language model. Meta’s aim was to advance AI research. Then, in July 2023 it released LLaMA 2 for research and commercial use. Impressively, the model outperforms other open-source language models in coding, reasoning, proficiency, and knowledge tests.\n\nMeta has adopted a unique approach, giving away its models for free. By open-sourcing its models, Meta hopes third-party developers will help improve the platform. Like Linux became the open-source operating system, Meta hopes Llama will become integral to building the next generation of AI applications.\n\nZuckerberg recently committed to developing artificial general intelligence. He pledged to spend heavily on compute infrastructure to support this effort. If Meta Platforms manages to standardize AI development through its open-source models, it will be a key player in the ecosystem. Considering Zuckerberg’s focus on winning in AI, it remains one of the top artificial intelligence stocks, and certainly one of the artificial intelligence stocks you should grab.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), has been derided for losing the AI war to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These assessments seem overly pessimistic. The company is an innovator and will prove the doubters wrong.\n\nThe search giant has made significant investments in artificial intelligence. The most significant one was the 2014 acquisition of DeepMind. Secondly, Google has been using artificial intelligence in search for a while, even before OpenAI launched ChatGPT.\n\nMoreover, it is introducing products that will integrate generative AI into search. Today, users can rely on Bard for chat-like responses. It is also testing Search Generative Experience and has expanded its features since its May 2023 launch.\n\nOne competitive advantage that positions Google to succeed is its high-quality training data. Today, Google has six products with over 2 billion users and 15 products, each with more than 500 million users. This data has been crucial in creating context-aware AI functions. For instance, features such as Smart Compose in Gmail have significantly improved the user experience.\n\nAlphabet’s leadership among artificial intelligence stocks extends beyond software to hardware, making it one of the best AI stocks. It developed a specialized chip, a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), specifically for AI applications. Its TPUs and open-source framework, Tensor, power services such as Gmail, Maps and YouTube.\n\nAs Google integrates AI into its products, it will see more growth. For example, serving context-rich ads into generative search results will improve ad conversion and monetization. In December 2023, Google released Gemini, its latest and most powerful LLM, proving Alphabet is still in the AI race. Don’t count out this technology giant yet; it has the resources to win!\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you were asked how many firms currently are valued at $1 trillion or more based on market cap, what would you guess? The answer might surprise you. It’s six. Of those six, one, Saudi Aramco, Is not readily accessible to American investors as it isn’t listed on commonly accessed exchanges.  Anyway, long story short, reaching a valuation of $1 trillion is an extraordinary feat. This has led us to this article on what brands could be the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nInvesting in such companies inherently makes sense. These companies are extraordinarily powerful and due to their extreme success are likely to continue to thrive. The three companies listed below could be the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is currently the 7th most valuable publicly traded stock overall. It boasts a market cap of $966 billion at the time of writing. Thus, Meta Platforms is very close to being considered one of those trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf and when Meta Platforms reaches $1 trillion it won’t be the first time it has achieved the feat. In late 2021 the company – then named Facebook – surpassed the mark. Shares are currently retesting those former highs in part due to positive remarks from Mizuho Securities. Analysts there recently increased their 12-month target price from $400 to $477.  If shares rise to that level, that would be almost exactly $100 above price levels when the shares first eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.\n\nArithmetically, that would suggest that Meta Platforms’ market capitalization would increase by more than 26% leading to a new evaluation above $1.2 trillion. It’s an entirely reasonable expectation given how strongly the company has rebounded in 2023 and into early 2024.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn reality, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is quite far from realistically reaching $1 trillion in valuation. However, AMD has made such significant strides over the last few years that it warrants discussion.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, AMD’s market cap is as high as it’s ever been, just above $260 billion. The company essentially has to quadruple in value to reach $1 trillion. Current projections suggest it could happen by the year 2031 based on share prices alone and the assumption that float does not increase.\n\nCertainly, other stocks much closer to $1 trillion in market cap at the moment are likely to cross that threshold first. However, I want to note just how rapidly AMD has grown over the last decade. In 2015 it was valued at less than $2 billion. The company has grown by a factor of 130 in less than a decade.\n\nToday, AMD is carving out a position as a legitimate challenger to Nvidia about artificial intelligence. The company will release its mi300 chips this year. Those chips are already seeing substantial demand from dominant firms that scoop up large volumes of chips for generative AI purposes.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a very interesting year for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)  and its stock. The company is known to be the largest foundry in the semiconductor industry. It is responsible for the technology behind the leading chips which it manufactures for the world’s best-known chip companies including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and more.\n\nTaiwan semiconductor manufacturing’s market cap has only eclipsed $700 billion once in its history. it is currently valued at less than $600 billion. However, the company’s recent bullish projections for 2024 chip production are a strong signal overall. The company expects the revenue growth to be above 20% this year.\n\nThat growth rate is roughly double that expected across the wider semiconductor sector overall. The bullish take here is that 2024 is shaping up to be a period of continued growth overall. Additionally, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Rafael Bostic Stated that he expects rate cuts to be implemented earlier than he had previously anticipated. Should that occur, it’s reasonable to believe that the tech sector will receive a boost which could drive Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing even higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Let your winners run.\n\nThat’s the advice shared by the world’s most successful investors. Investing legend Peter Lynch famously said: “Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.”\n\nIf a stock is running ahead, the best move investors can make is sit back and enjoy the ride. This is especially true if one happens to take a position in a hypergrowth stock. That is a security of a company that is dominating its respective industry, posting accelerating earnings, and whose profits are increasing at an exponential rate.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuch growth stocks are rare, but they can certainly have an outsized impact on a portfolio and lead to long-term wealth. With the stock market at an all-time high, let’s look at three hypergrowth stocks to buy now and hold forever.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has reasserted itself as the world’s dominant streaming company. It’s also the only profitable one.\n\nAs of yesterday, NFLX stock is up 12% after another strong earnings print. Growing subscription numbers are driving the share price higher. In the last six months, the stock has gained 30%, including an 18% rise so far in 2024. News that the company added 13.1 million net new subscribers in Q4 of 2023 has shifted the share price into overdrive.\n\nNow, Netflix has 260.8 million subscribers worldwide, ahead of the 256 million that analysts had expected. Also, the company issued strong forward guidance, increasing its 2024 full-year operating margin forecast to 24%, up from a previous range of 22% to 23%. Netflix is forecasting earnings of $4.49 a share for the current first quarter of 2024, higher than the $4.10 estimated on Wall Street.\n\nThe financial results were released on the same day that Netflix announced it will begin streaming professional wrestling in 2025. This marks the company’s most significant move into live sports and entertainment yet. Netflix’s financial results have improved considerably since it added paid advertisements to its streaming service. And the crackdown on password sharing among users of its platform helped significantly. In the last 12 months, NFLX stock has increased 52%.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is not as well known as many other microchip and semiconductor concerns. In fact, the company’s marketing slogan is: “The most important tech company you’ve never heard of.”\n\nHowever, the Dutch firm is among the most important semiconductor equipment makers in the world. Business is booming. ASML makes a machine called an “extreme ultraviolet lithography” that is required in the manufacturing of the world’s most advanced microchips. Therefore, demand is surging.\n\nFurther, ASML just announced a 30% increase in its full-year sales. The company reported Q4 2023 revenue and profits that trounced Wall Street forecasts. Sales in Q4 were up 12.5% year over year (YOY), and they rose 30% for all of last year compared to 2022. While the strong earnings have ASML stock up 9%, there’s additional room to run. Over the last 12 months, ASML stock is up only 25%, a fraction of the gains seen in other chipmakers.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nNews of ASML stock’s strong Q4 print has shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) up 6%, trading at an all-time high. AMD stock seems unstoppable right now, having already risen 30% in 2024.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the share price has gained 140%. Despite the big run, analysts see more runway ahead for the shares. Analysts at Wedbush Securities just reiterated their outperform, buy equivalent, rating on AMD stock and raised their price target to $200 a share, implying another 12% upside.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is rising on expectations that its latest crop of microchips will position it to take market share from rivals such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD’s latest Ryzen and MI300X accelerator microchips are being hailed as among the most powerful in the marketplace. In fact, they are capable of powering the most advanced AI models and applications. Many analysts expect AMD to go head-to-head with Nvidia this year and prevail. AMD stock is up 712% in the last five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "3 Top-Ranked Stocks to Buy for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Exposure",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is Wall Street’s new obsession, with companies discussing the technology in a snowballing fashion and helping to keep sentiment positive.\n\nThe robust quarterly results we’ve received from NVIDIA NVDA over the last year have added further fuel to the fire, with NVIDIA flexing the scorching-hot demand it’s been witnessing regarding its AI chips.\n\nStill, outside of NVIDIA, there are several other stocks investors can tap into for AI exposure, including Vertiv VRT, Arista Networks ANET, and IBM IBM. For those interested in exposure to the technology slated to change the world, let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nArista Networks\n\nArista Networks shares have benefited nicely from the AI frenzy, up nearly 120% just over the last year. The company is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large data centers, campus, and routing environments.\n\nAnalysts have taken their current fiscal year expectations well higher over the last year, with the $6.55 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up 25% over the last year and suggesting 43% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKeep an eye out for the company’s upcoming quarterly release expected on February 12th, with consensus expectations reflecting 21% earnings growth on 20% higher sales. The company posted strong quarterly results in its latest release, driven by continued customer momentum in enterprise, cloud, and AI sectors.\n\nThe company has enjoyed considerable top line expansion over the last several years, posting double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth rates in ten consecutive quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVertiv\n\nVertiv is a global leader in designing, building, and servicing critical infrastructure that enables vital applications for data centers. The company is the only pure-play data center infrastructure provider able to deliver across the entire spectrum of thermal and power technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts have taken their expectations higher across the board, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company posted notably strong results in its latest release thanks to healthy end markets and momentum, raising its FY23 guidance across all metrics. Vertiv CEO Giordano Albertazzi said, “We are still in the early stages, but the industry is gearing up to deploy the data center infrastructure needed to meet the compute capacity that AI is demanding,”\n\nThe recent string of robust quarterly results has had shares notably hot, moving higher following each of its last three releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVertiv’s hot demand is reflected by consensus expectations, currently alluding to 230% earnings growth on 20% higher sales in FY23. The stock sports a Style Score of ‘A’ for Growth.\n\nIBM\n\nIBM’s latest set of quarterly results excited the market, with shares moving well higher post-earnings and continuing a recent trend of post-earnings bullishness. IBM posted a 2.4% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate and reported sales modestly above expectations. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company touted its AI demand, saying, ‘In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue in all of our segments, driven by continued adoption of our hybrid cloud and AI offerings. Client demand for AI is accelerating and our book of business for watsonx and generative AI roughly doubled from the third to the fourth quarter.’\n\nIn addition to AI exposure, IBM shares also pay a healthy dividend, yielding a sizable 3.8% annually. Dividend growth is also there, with the company carrying an 0.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nThe company is a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrats group. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe AI frenzy continues to dominate market headlines, with companies continuing to speak on the technology in a snowballing fashion.\n\nIt isn’t just beloved NVIDIA NVDA enjoying the tailwinds, as Vertiv VRT, Arista Networks ANET, and IBM IBM have also seen the same.\n\nOn top of AI exposure, all three stocks above sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting the optimism among analysts surrounding the technology.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Small-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever: January 2024",
        "content": "Small-cap healthcare stocks might be the next stock market goldmine, but many investors are overlooking the sector’s potential. Small-cap healthcare stocks tend to be nimbler and more innovative than their blue-chip counterparts (with some exceptions), meaning they’re better equipped to navigate tricky market conditions and changing industry trends.\n\nAt the same time, many of the best small-cap healthcare stocks capitalize, in one way or another, on global trends that sent stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) soaring. Innovations within small-cap healthcare stocks include advanced AI, machine learning, automation, alternative transportation, and more. What sets these small-cap healthcare stocks apart from megaliths like Nvidia or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), of course, is their relative cheapness – and their potential to skyrocket and join the ranks of the biggest stocks driving tomorrow’s market.\n\nClearPoint Neuro (CLPT) Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock.\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock\n\nClearPoint Neuro (NASDAQ:CLPT) is on a winning streak this month, making it one of the best-performing small-cap healthcare stocks you’ve never heard of. CLPT’s flagship product is its ClearPoint platform, which helps surgical providers better navigate the brain and associated systems when diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. So what’s sending ClearPoint’s shares surging nearly 15% since Jan. 1? Rapid-fire regulatory approvals across market domains entrench ClearPoint as the “next big thing” in medical device manufacturers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe first and most impactful approval was the FDA’s nod towards clinical usage of ClearPoint’s SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System. This platform helps providers better navigate directed radiation therapy during stereotactic radiosurgery. This non-invasive surgery is a radiological alternative to slicing patients open and, instead, beams radiation toward cancerous areas to damage the cancer cells and shrink tumors.\n\nStory continues\n\nCritically, the platform leverages ClearPoint’s tech within the operating room rather than restricting it to an MRI facility, as past tech demanded. President and CEO Joe Burnett summarized the bullish benefits well:\n\n“More than 95% of all stereotactic neuro-navigation procedures take place in the OR [and] this product is the first in ClearPoint’s history that does not require the use of MRI during the procedure, allowing us to access more hospitals, and to support an order of magnitude more patients than our legacy portfolio.”\n\nClearPoint also secured approval from European Union regulators to ship existing products to the continent this month, further expanding its footprint and increasing its total addressable market.\n\nTransMedics Group (TMDX) stethoscope on a stock chart representing healthcare stocks to buy. Healthcare Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTransMedics Group (NASDAQ:TMDX) leads small-cap healthcare stocks as the only FDA-approved platform for lung, heart, and liver transports. This sets it apart operationally, of course, but also helps the healthcare industry address major issues within its organ donor infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022, about 15,000 organ and tissue donors died, but the total donor organ utilization rate was a fraction of the total available. For instance, of the 14,905 viable lungs available in 2022, providers successfully transplanted just 2,692. The delta between available organs and those transplanted is primarily due to difficulties in safe transport and tissue maintenance, a challenge TMDX effectively addresses.\n\nTo that end, the sales of this small-cap healthcare stock are skyrocketing, showcasing its long-term potential. The company’s third-quarter revenue increased by 26% to $66.4 million and marked seven consecutive quarters of revenue growth. We’ll have to wait until Feb. 20 to see TMDX’s end-of-year report, but if 2022’s 200% revenue jump compared to 2021 is any indication, we should expect big things from this small-cap healthcare stock.\n\nHims & Hers Health (HIMS) The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nHims & Hers Health (NYSE:HIMS) is a small-cap healthcare stock that’s tapped into the expanding telehealth trend that, while obvious in retrospect, was innovative at its inception. The company specializes in providing healthcare services considered “embarrassing,” such as sexual wellness and hair loss treatment, remotely and conveniently. This approach bypasses the discomfort and inconvenience of in-person care. HIMS expanded its services to include therapy post-pandemic, creating a self-contained ecosystem that retains customers on its platform.\n\nBut, serving a long-term strategy, HIMS recently partnered with Hartford HealthCare to offer in-person referrals for conditions like heart health and weight loss. Though seemingly contrary to the telehealth model, this decision aims to bolster the company’s stability. By incorporating in-person referrals, HIMS expands its service range for existing patients and eases the management of elective healthcare needs.\n\nThis approach mirrors its expansion into mental health treatment, further developing a comprehensive, closed-loop ecosystem. Moreover, HIMS is poised to gain from Hartford providers who may recommend HIMS for specialized patient needs. While the synergy only benefits Connecticut users and patients for now, successful implementation today could mean a national pivot tomorrow for this small-cap healthcare stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "The Next Stock Superstar? 3 AI Stocks the Gurus Are Buying Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "The run-up in valuation for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) last year meant artificial intelligence (AI) was just about the only thing anyone was discussing. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 set the world on fire with its potential applications in business and everyday use. Demand for AI tools took off.\n\nThat’s continuing into 2024, and with good reason. We’ve only just started scratching the surface of the opportunities AI unlocks. There is a long runway to go. Of course, there is a dark side to AI and headwinds too. But money is still pouring into the market, and the following three companies are among the best AI stocks to buy.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia sucked most of the oxygen out of the room when it came to AI chips. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), however, is making a name for itself too. The chipmaker recently unveiled its MI300X AI chip, which offers better performance than Nvidia’s popular H100 chip. It’s already lining up a stellar clientele list. Both Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft announced they would buy AMD’s chip. The latter will use it in its Azure cloud services business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough the chipmaker didn’t announce a price, it’s expected to be cheaper than the $40,000 Nvidia reportedly charges for its H100. CEO Lisa Su said it would have to cost less and work better if AMD wanted to lure customers to its chips. AMD also beefed up its software platform and application interface ROCm to provide a better user experience when using the AI chips.\n\nMario Gabelli of GAMCO Investors (OTCMKTS:GAMI) boosted his holdings of AMD stock by 42% in the third quarter. He paid an average of around $108 a share for the stock, giving him a 55% gain already. He stands to reap even greater gains because of the exponential growth expected to come from AI.\n\nWall Street forecasts Advanced Micro Devices will grow earnings at 13% a year for the next five years. AMD has a 47x forward price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nSemiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) just reported robust earnings for the fourth quarter. Driven by demand for the specialized equipment needed to make AI chips, orders more than tripled from the year-ago figure to a record 9 billion euros. Sales soared to 7.2 billion euros and generated 2 billion euros in profits, up 9% year-over-year (YoY).\n\nASML is the world’s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. These are critical tools required by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung to produce the advanced AI chips customers or themselves need. TSM is the biggest foundry and is where Nvidia gets its chips from.\n\nGabelli was a buyer here again. He increased his holdings by about 10% and paid around $664 per share. That’s a 26% gain after the recent earnings run-up. Yet, Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management was also adding to his position bringing his total shares to almost 4.9 million.\n\nHowever, ASML surprised analysts by keeping its sales guidance flat for the period. New trade restrictions on China have clouded just how much business the equipment maker can do. A lot of sales were pulled forward into the quarter, but the upward momentum suggests it will keep moving higher.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SOUN stock: SoundHound's Headquarters exterior featuring a sign with the company's logo in the foreground and a parking lot and building in the background.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nYou might know SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) as the music identification app to help you remember a song’s title and artist when you hear it playing. Yet that’s a commoditized business, and SoundHound was already fully embracing AI before going public in 2021.\n\nSix years earlier, it introduced Houndify to the world, the company’s “voice-enabled conversational interface.” You can tell AI wasn’t a thing then, as it was not identified as a key technology, though that was still at the heart of it. The voice AI platform could allow devices to hold conversations with users and answer complex questions. Today, Houndify is behind Honda’s (NYSE:HMC) in-car assistant in Japan and Europe. It is also used in a host of other industries, including telecom, hospitality, restaurants, financial services and voice-enabled mobile apps.\n\nSoundHound is reaping the benefits. Revenue is up 33% in 2023 to $28.7 million with gross margins hitting 73%. Adjusted EBITDA improved 57% from last year, as losses narrowed to $7.3 million. Profitability is just over the horizon. That may be why hedge fund operator Mark Diker of Diker Management increased his position by 150%. He now owns over 502,000 shares.\n\nWhile SOUN stock is up 37% in the last 12 months, it’s down sharply from its highs. Trading below $2 a share indicates the market might want to first see profits from a supposed AI growth stock. Soundhound is certainly a riskier stock than ASML or AMD, and it’s an oblique play on AI. Yet this could be a diamond in the rough for investors willing to let this company develop its own voice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks With the Potential to Be Even More Magnificent Than the Magnificent 7",
        "content": "The so-called “Magnificent 7” are a group of mega-cap tech stocks that have absolutely dominated the markets in recent years. Investors who remained loyal to these stocks through thick and thin have beaten the market by a wide margin. Unsurprisingly, many investors are willing to let this trade ride.\n\nHowever, large-cap stocks can see their growth rates deteriorate. Additionally, leadership shifts in specific sectors. Thus, taking a look at stocks outside of the largest possible players in specific industries can lead to outsized performance. The three stocks on this list each are massive in their own right.\n\nSo, let’s discover stocks that could provide outsized performance relative to the Magnificent 7 over the next five to 10 years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), Warren Buffett’s investment firm, is edging closer to the trillion-dollar mark. Its current market cap is at $777.9 billion. For investors looking for the best-quality, large-cap stocks, Berkshire ought to be leading your list.\n\nThis stock provides positioning as we head into economic uncertainty. Berkshire Hathaway has a massive cash hoard, with more than $150 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. The company’s $341.1 billion in equity and fixed-maturity securities rivals the largest conglomerates out there. Further, BRK-B is filled with defensive names with plenty of growth upside.\n\nBuffett’s approach to long-term investing really stands out as the key investing thesis for owning this stock. Berkshire is among the few massive conglomerates actively-focused on capital preservation, something that really matters in downturns. And with plenty of dry powder on the sidelines, if a massive correction does take place, this is the company with the cash flow and ability to step in and scoop up incredible bargains.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is among the notable chipmakers that has seen consistent upside during this recent rally. The company’s MI300x GPU chipset has targeted Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) lead and their A100 and H100 chips.\n\nAMD has plenty of innovation spurring impressive long-term growth expectations. Investors betting on AMD may be placing a bet that this sector could become a two-horse race in terms of high-performance computing chips. In the AI realm, AMD is projecting $2 billion in AI chip sales for the year. While that’s far from Nvidia’s expectations, it does suggest AMD could build som substantial market traction. And this could fuel a continued rally in the stock.\n\nNow, the company’s valuation is considerable, with investors forced to swallow a price-sales ratio of more than 11-times. Yet, if this company is able to grow according to plan, this multiple will come down to more reasonable levels over time.\n\nTherefore, AMD is likely the most speculative pick on this list. But given its traction in key high-growth markets, long-term growth investors need to consider this name, even over Nvidia.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock has demonstrated strong momentum, nearly doubling over the past year as well. Of course, this rally comes following a 2022 plunge. There’s plenty of upside to be had if Shopify approaches its previous all-time highs.\n\nOf course, macro conditions need to improve for this to happen. But on a fundamentals basis, Shopify continues to sport strong numbers. In the company’s third quarter, SHOP reported a 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase to $1.7 billion. Also, growing merchant participation contributed to a 29% surge in subscription revenue to $486 million.\n\nIn 2024, the company is expected to exhibit robust strength, as this growth continues. And, if Shopify continues to beat earnings expectations, expect plenty of upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Investors seeking maximum returns should concentrate on growth stocks. These firms often deliver high revenue growth. Some of these companies are profitable while others are narrowing their losses. Some growth stocks can generate more gains in 1-3 years than most indexes accumulate within a decade.\n\nGrowth powerhouse stocks can generate those types of gains, but not every growth stock is a winner. Furthermore, some growth stocks are enticing for 1-3 years and then fizzle out after they stop growing. Investors have to consider several factors before investing in growth stocks, but these stock picks can offer good starting points.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks.\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost of the growth powerhouses are in the tech sector due to the industry’s ability to scale quickly. However, diversifying your portfolio with non-tech stocks can mitigate risk.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) offers infrastructure services and has amassed a $2 billion market cap. The little-known infrastructure stock has silently gained 466% over the past five years. Shares have gained 133% over the past year.\n\nThe infrastructure firm has an 18 P/E ratio and is expanding its net profit margins. The company reported $560 million in revenue during the third quarter of 2023 and a net income of $39.4 million. These numbers represent growth rates of 13.7% and 33.3% respectively.\n\nSterling Infrastructure offers solutions in building, transportation, and e-infrastructure. E-infrastructure is the fastest-growing segment and represents business generated by companies seeking to build data centers, e-commerce distribution centers, commercial warehousing, energy, and next-gen manufacturing.\n\nEssentially, the fast-growing e-infrastructure segment represents business from large tech companies. This business segment closed the third quarter with an $891 million backlog. It represents a 48% increase from year-end 2022 levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerion (PERI) peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerion (NASDAQ:PERI) is a small advertising company with a market cap under $1.5 billion and a 12 P/E ratio. Shares have gained close to 800% over the past five years but have dropped by 10% over the past year.\n\nDespite the lower stock price, Perion has continued to deliver high revenue and earnings growth. The company achieved 17% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and increased its net income by 28% year-over-year.\n\nBears may point to a contract with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that is set to expire in 2024. Perion’s partnership with Bing is attributed to roughly 45% of its total revenue. However, the two corporations have been in a partnership since 2010, and it’s likely that the partnership will get extended. Perion’s team feels confident that the contract will get extended.\n\nPerion is valued as if the partnership has already fallen through. An announcement extending the partnership will likely send shares soaring. Furthermore, the company has exposure to several high-growth advertising segments such as connected TV. While Microsoft makes up a large percentage of Perion’s revenue, the firm has been diversifying its revenue streams.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) offers wafers that help chipmakers create more effective chips. The company has an integral place in the chipmaking process and has soared by 557% over the past five years.\n\nHowever, the gains haven’t arrived lately. The stock has been in free fall since August and is down by over 30% from its all-time high. However, investors have been loading up on the dip which has resulted in a 5% year-to-date gain. That includes a 15% rally in a single week that started on January 16th.\n\nAxcelis Technologies trades at a 19 P/E ratio and has a $4.3 billion market cap. The firm can likely continue to grow based on P/E multiple expansion. However, things are looking up for the semiconductor industry and can result in more gains for ACLS.\n\nAxcelis Technologies has been posting solid financials even with the headwinds. In the third quarter of 2023, the firm generated $292.3 million in revenue and $65.9 million in net income. Those numbers represent 27.6% and 63.7% year-over-year growth respectively. The company isn’t slowing down and has a reasonable valuation relative to its financials and industry tailwinds.\n\nStride (LRN) text books on a desk with a chalkboard in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStride (NYSE:LRN) is an educational management platform that has soared by 93% over the past year. The company’s profit margin is expanding on the back of revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe firm recently achieved a revenue milestone and reached $480.2 million in the process. It’s a 13% year-over-year increase. Stride’s leadership also expects the company’s earnings per share to more than double by 2028.\n\nThe company is experiencing its largest growth among middle schoolers and high schoolers. The company reported a 20.3% year-over-year growth rate in this segment.\n\nStride aims to generate revenue in the range of $1.96 billion to $2.03 billion in fiscal year 2024. The midpoint represents a 9% year-over-year growth rate compared to fiscal year 2023.\n\nOnline education is becoming more realistic as a path to a successful career. Stride is one of the companies leading that charge. Stride students resisted the “learning loss” trend associated with the pandemic. As students and families look for more affordable and convenient education choices, Stride may continue to grow.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Chatbot conversation Ai Artificial Intelligence technology online customer service.

AI stocks\n\nSource: khunkornStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a rapidly growing company that is at the center of the artificial intelligence boom. Just like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) did last year, Supermicro released updated guidance that reflects significant growth.\n\nLeadership now expects the company to generate $3.6-$3.65 million in revenue. That’s a significant jump from the prior guidance which ranged from $2.7-$2.9 billion in revenue. The midpoints represent a 29.5% increase in guidance. The company will double its revenue from the same period last year if it achieves the new guidance.\n\nSupermicro offers servers and storage systems that are built to handle the intense workload of artificial intelligence. These servers have gained significant traction. Supermicro has the potential to exceed its new guidance while setting sky-high guidance for the following quarter.\n\nThe stock has delivered exceptional gains for investors. Shares are up by 53% year-to-date, 494% over the past year, and 2,830% over the past five years. There is a lot of excitement around this stock as investors anticipate a large runway over the next few years.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is a security cloud platform company that protects valuable data points from hackers. More businesses are investing in Zscaler and other cybersecurity firms as cyber attacks continue to increase.\n\nZscaler isn’t profitable yet but has been narrowing its losses. In the meantime, the corporation continues to deliver compelling top-line growth. Zscaler has 7,700 customers including 468 customers who each generate over $1 million in annual recurring revenue for the firm.\n\nZscaler started the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on a high note with 40% year-over-year revenue growth. Billings went up by 34% year-over-year which indicates the business is still growing. GAAP net losses were cut in half year-over-year.\n\nGuidance for the second quarter suggests $505-$507 million in revenue. The midpoint represents 30.5% year-over-year growth. The firm is also aiming for $2.09-$2.10 billion in revenue for the entire fiscal year. The midpoint represents a 29.6% year-over-year growth rate compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is another high-flying cybersecurity stock that has rewarded investors. Shares have gained 180% over the past year and are up by 364% over the past five years.\n\nThe firm recently became profitable, and net profit margins should rapidly expand. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 continued this trend. Revenue jumped by 35% year-over-year on the back of a lucrative business subscription model. Most businesses won’t cancel their cybersecurity software because doing so can leave them vulnerable to hackers.\n\nWhile Crowdstrike has always delivered high revenue growth, its net income growth is a pleasant surprise for investors. The cybersecurity leader posted $26.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $55.0 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year.\n\nCrowdstrike’s Falcon platform remains a big hit, and the company has been using artificial intelligence to strengthen its offerings. The firm helps businesses keep their information secure from hackers and respond to attacks faster.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in PERI, ACLS, and SMCI.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Nvidia (NVDA)",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 39.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 268.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -2.8%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.95, which means that the company gets $0.95 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.74, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 118.4% this year versus the industry average of 5.2%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA is one of the largest companies in the world with a market cap of $1.5 trillion. Shares of NVIDIA are hitting new all-time highs in 2024, gaining 212% in the last year.\n\nIt’s not cheap. NVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 48 but it’s expected to grow sales by 53% in fiscal 2025.\n\nShould you own NVIDIA in your portfolio?\n\n2. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is a $3 trillion market cap company, making it one of the largest companies in the world. Shares of Microsoft keep hitting new all-time highs in 2024 and are up 64.4% over the last year.\n\nMicrosoft is trading with a forward P/E of just 35.8, which makes it look cheap compared to NVIDIA. However, sales are expected to rise just 14.4% in fiscal 2024, which is considerably less than the blockbuster growth expected of NVIDIA.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you own Microsoft in your portfolio?\n\nWhat About Growth Outside of the Mega-Caps?\n\nGrowth stocks other than the Magnificent 7 have been hitting new highs in recent months as well. You can own those stocks in Invesco’s NASDAQ NextGen ETF, which tracks the 101 to 200th largest companies in the NASDAQ.\n\nOr you can own the individual components.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer is the third largest position in the Invesco NASDAQ NextGen ETF. It has a market cap of $26 billion. Shares of Super Micro Computer are up a whopping 520% over the last year.\n\nYet Super Micro Computer is still trading with an attractive forward P/E of just 26.7. Sales are expected to jump 53% in fiscal 2024.\n\nShould a smaller tech company like Super Micro Computer be on your short list instead of the Mag 7?\n\n4. Tractor Supply Company (TSCO)\n\nTractor Supply is also a top holding of the Invesco NASDAQ NextGen ETF. But it’s not seeing the big returns of some of the technology names. Shares of Tractor Supply are up just 6% over the last year.\n\nIt trades with a forward P/E of just 22 but earnings are expected to rise just 3.3% in 2024.\n\nShould investors consider growth stocks like Tractor Supply even if they’re not in technology?\n\n5. Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA)\n\nUlta Beauty has a market cap of $23.2 billion. It’s also a top position in the Invesco NASDAQ NextGen ETF. Shares of Ulta Beauty are down 4.1% over the last year.\n\nIt’s the cheapest of these NextGen stocks with a forward P/E of 18.8. Earnings are expected to rise 6.4% in fiscal 2025.\n\nShould a retailer like Ulta Beauty be on your list of must-own growth stocks?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Only Investing in the Mag 7 Stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT and ULTA in her personal portfolios.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Game Has Changed! Buy Nvidia Stock Even If It’s Expensive.",
        "content": "Did you miss out on the magnificent rally in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock? Or maybe you’re worried that a crash could be right around the corner? I understand these concerns, but I invite you to set your fears aside and consider taking at least a small share position in Nvidia.\n\nThe main reason to own Nvidia stock in 2024 is to get some portfolio exposure to the market for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. At this point, it’s more of a necessity than a luxury.\n\nJust consider the potential rewards of investing in Nvidia, versus the opportunity costs of missing out on the next big AI-fueled rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAn Unexpected Boost for NVDA Stock\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for NVDA stock to move higher, but here’s one you probably didn’t expect. A different chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), reportedly anticipates that its revenue growth will be at least 20% this year, or more precisely, in the low- to mid-20s percentage-wise.\n\nThat’s double the expected revenue-growth expectation of 10% for the global chip market. Why would this be bullish for Nvidia, though? First of all, if Taiwan Semiconductor anticipates robust demand for microchips in 2024, this should bode well for Nvidia.\n\nFurthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor isn’t necessarily a rival to Nvidia. Remember, Taiwan Semiconductor is a third-party chip manufacturer that produces AI chips for U.S. chipmakers, including Nvidia.\n\nHence, optimism surrounding Taiwan Semiconductor should, to a certain extent, reflect positively on Nvidia. It’s yet another reason — in case you needed one — to buy Nvidia stock with confidence.\n\nNvidia Stock Is the ‘Top AI Play’\n\nAs NVDA stock rallies and sends the short-sellers into hibernation, experts on Wall Street can’t help but to notice Nvidia’s dominance in the AI-hardware arena. For example, Barclays analysts observed, “With supply constraints, customers are often using the entire NVDA platform in order to get priority shipments of accelerators.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer found that Nvidia leverages a “dominant hardware/software installed base.” Consequently, Schafer identified NVDA stock as his “top AI play.”\n\nMoreover, Nvidia has a sizable order backlog that Schafer estimates will extend for more than six months. With that in mind, Schafer reiterated his “outperform” rating on Nvidia stock along with a $650 price target.\n\nThat’s not unreasonable, considering the stock touched $570 not long ago. One catalyst to get NVDA stock to $650 will be Nvidia’s B100 AI chip. Be on the lookout, as Schafer expects Nvidia to launch the B100 chip in 2024’s third quarter.\n\nDon’t Fret About Nvidia Stock Being Too Expensive\n\nIf you got hung up about valuations in 2023, you may have left a lot of money on the table with Nvidia stock. Are you going to make the same mistake again in 2024?\n\nThe year is still young, and so is Nvidia’s growth story. Like Schafer, you can make NVDA stock your top AI play. Even after last year’s amazing share-price rally, it’s not too get on the bus for a long, profitable ride.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 EV Stocks to Turn $100,000 Into $1 Million: January 2024",
        "content": "Electric vehicle sales have been increasing at a robust pace in the last few years. In 2022, global EV sales exceeded 10 million. Further, EV sales for last year are likely at 14 million and would account for 18% of total car sales. As healthy growth sustains, I am bullish on some of the best EV stocks.\n\nI would further add that these numbers are dwarfed in comparison to the estimates for 2030. It’s expected that global EV car stock will expand to 350 million vehicles by the end of the decade. Also, EVs would represent more than 60% of vehicles sold globally.\n\nA key conclusion from these estimates is that there is huge growth potential for EV companies. Revenue can increase multi-fold in the next five to seven years. This is likely to translate into significant cash flow upside and massive value creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs the world faces near-term macroeconomic headwinds, it’s a good time to consider exposure to attractively valued EV stocks. In my view, a portfolio of these stocks can deliver 10x returns by 2030.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nA sub-portfolio of electric vehicle stocks would be incomplete without considering exposure to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In July 2023, TSLA stock had surged to highs of $299. The considering correction has followed to current levels of $209 and it seems like a good accumulation opportunity.\n\nWith mass deliveries of Cybertruck impending, I am positive on the stock trending higher. Further, Roadster is also in the pipeline and I believe that Tesla’s deliveries growth will be healthy in the next few years.\n\nIn the long term, Tesla has set an ambitious target of producing 20 million EVs annually by 2030. Of course, there will be challenges related to competition. However, the market has potential and Tesla has high financial flexibility to set-up multiple new factories.\n\nTesla has also indicated that it’s committed to halving EV production cost. If this is achieved in the coming years, the Company can see delivery volumes skyrocketing in emerging markets like India and Indonesia, among others.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong emerging Chinese EV stocks, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) looks like the best bet. While Chinese market sentiments have depressed the stock, I am bullish on multibagger returns over the next five years. It’s worth noting that LI stock is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 20. With the Company is growing at over 100% on a year-on-year basis, undervaluation is significant.\n\nFor 2023, Li Auto reported deliveries growth of 182.2% on a year-on-year basis to 376,030. With the launch of Li MEGA in March, I expect deliveries growth to remain strong. Further, deliveries growth will be supported by aggressive retail expansion within China.\n\nLi Auto has also been active on the innovation front. The Company has partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to explore the integration of artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Company will be using Nvidia’s Drive Thor autonomous driving chip in its next-generation EVs from 2025.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PACRFY) is among the undervalued millionaire maker EV stocks to buy. PCRFY stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 7.8 and offers a dividend yield of 2.38%. With ambitious expansion plans for the EV battery business, I am optimistic on the stock delivering multibagger returns.\n\nPanasonic Holdings has guided to increase EV battery capacity to 200GWh by financial year 2031. This would imply quadrupling of capacity and translate into healthy revenue growth. At the same time, the Company has guided for continued improvement in EBITDA margin.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that innovation will continue to provide an edge to Panasonic. The Company is working on batteries that have higher energy density. The target is to increasing volumetric energy density to 1,000 Wh/L by 2031. This will be 25% higher from current levels. With aggressive expansion and focus on innovation, Panasonic is positioned to be a value creator.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s expected that global demand for lithium will surge five-folds by 2030 on the back of demand for EV batteries. It’s therefore important to hold few lithium stocks for multibagger returns. With lithium prices correcting sharply, it’s the best time to accumulate undervalued names.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock looks massively undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.6. The 1.33% dividend yield stock might have bottomed out and I expect a strong rally after consolidation.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Albemarle is likely to see significant EBITDA margin contraction. However, that’s discounted in the stock. An important point to note is that even with depressed lithium price, Albemarle has guided for operating cash flow of $600 to $800 million for 2023.\n\nOnce lithium trends higher and Albemarle boosts its lithium conversion capacity, cash flows will be robust. Albemarle targets increasing lithium conversion capacity to 600ktpa by 2027. This would imply tripling of capacity from 2022 levels. Of course, a lot depends on the time-line for recovery in lithium prices.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium miner that’s likely to deliver 10x returns within the next five years. At a market valuation of $741 million, Lithium Americas is a steal considering the asset potential.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the Company’s Thacker Pass project has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Further, the asset has a mine life of 40 years and is expected to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $1.1 billion. Therefore, the asset is a cash flow machine and once lithium trends higher, LAC stock is likely to skyrocket.\n\nI must add here that I don’t see any financing concerns related to project construction. General Motors (NYSE:GM) will be infusing $650 million in the project. The Company has also committed a ten-year offtake agreement from phase one of the project. Therefore, lithium price is the only factor that holding back the stock from surging. I would buy at current levels and hold with patience for the next few years.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is among the high-risk bets that can deliver multibagger returns. The Company is working towards the commercialization of solid-state batteries. If there is success on that front, SLDP stock is an easy 10x from current levels of $1.5.\n\nIn terms of news flow, there are two important points to note. First, Solid Power has made its first A-1 EV cell deliveries to BMW to formally enter automotive qualification. Positive results from validation testing can be a game-changer.\n\nFurther, the Company has deepened its partnership with SK On. As a part of the agreement, Solid Power will license its cell designs and production processes to the latter. Additionally, Solid Power will be installing a pilot cell production line for SK On at Korea facility.\n\nTechnology licensing is likely to help in accelerating the commercialization through parallel research and development. I must add that in December 2022, the Company licensed its cell design and manufacturing process to BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) for parallel R&D. Therefore, with strong partners, I am optimistic on Solid Power achieving commercialization by 2026.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station, BLNK stock\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong EV charging stocks, Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) looks attractive after a big correction. With positive news on the financial front, I expect BLNK stock to trend higher.\n\nThe first reason to be positive on Blink is stellar growth. For Q3 2023, the Company reported revenue of $43 million. On a year-on-year basis, revenue surged by 152%. With significant penetration potential, I expect healthy revenue growth to sustain in the coming years.\n\nThe second positive to note is that Blink has guided for gross margin of 30% for 2023. Further, the Company expects to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by December 2024. With healthy revenue growth, I expect continued margin expansion on operating leverage.\n\nFrom a growth perspective, the Company has contracted 1,435 DC-fast chargers during the first nine months of 2023. This has translated into $27 million in recognized revenue. Product diversification is likely to support strong growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer said in a latest program on CNBC that \"all is not well in corporate America.\" Cramer was referring to weak earnings which according to him show that the state of the economy is \"sluggish.\" Cramer said that we are \"hearing\" that the Fed might not be done tightening or at least be \"reluctant to cut in the spring\" because inflation remains sticky. Jim Cramer said that when the Fed began hiking interest rates stocks were punished and when the Fed pivoted near the end of 2023 stocks exploded which included many companies which, according to Cramer, didn’t \"deserve\" to see their stock prices soar.\n\nJim Cramer said that latest earnings show the effects of the Fed's tightening. He said many companies that raised prices are now seeing sales declines, which means they will have to roll back price hikes which would affect their stock prices. Cramer said it's \"disturbing\" but it's part of the business cycle.\n\n\"Throw Out the Old Playbook\"\n\nIn a separate program, Jim Cramer said the Fed's tightening cycle is peculiar in nature in its effects on stocks. Cramer said homebuilder stocks like Pulte Group, Lennar and Toll Brothers are going higher despite rate hikes while in the past homebuilder stocks always got punished during rate hikes. Cramer said in any \"normal\" tightening cycle stocks from homebuilding, steel and industrials sectors would get slaughtered but in this cycle many of the stocks from these sectors touched new highs.\n\nCramer also said the \"AI craze should have ended ages ago\" but stocks like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are still going higher. Cramer said that means AI was not a hype, after all.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer also said people kept complaining about lack of market breadth and the concentration of market gains in a few companies often called the Magnificent Seven group. Cramer said this lack of breadth has not mattered \"one bit.\"\n\nCramer said when the market is not sticking to the old playbook anymore, you've \"got to throw out\" the playbook and write a new one. Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds?Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer recently recommended investors to \"hold\" BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock. Cramer said he does not understand why this stock is so \"inexpensive.\" Over the past one year BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock has lost about 31%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX). The most significant stakeholder of BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX) during this period was Israel Englander's Millennium Management which owns a $54 million stake in BioNTech SE - ADR (NASDAQ:BNTX).\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Notable trims in the quarter included Zscaler, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Ingersoll Rand. BioNTech is a biotech company focused on developing immunotherapies to treat cancer and other serious diseases. Management has been using its COVID-19 vaccine cash flows to reinvest in building a substantial early stage pipeline. The company’s intellectual property in mRNA and COVID-funded manufacturing capacity leave it well positioned to develop new mRNA vaccines and cancer therapies. In addition, the company has non-mRNA technology (e.g., cell therapy assets) and blue-chip partnerships offering additional optionality. While we are optimistic that this pipeline will eventually yield promising medications within oncology and infectious diseases, patience will be required. In the meantime, demand for COVID-19 vaccine boosters continues to wane. Therefore, we decided to trim the position in favor of more compelling near-term opportunities.”\n\n9. Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nA caller recently asked Jim Cramer during his program about his thoughts on buying some more Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) stock. Cramer said you \"should\" buy more shares of the industrial tools company. Cramer highlighted the stock's over 3% dividend yield. Cramer said that if people are buying Home Depot on lows, they should be buying Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK).\n\n8. Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS), Jim Cramer said it is the \"best one of the silver companies.\"\n\n\"Holy cow, they crushed it,\" said Jim Cramer about the Canada-headquartered mining company.\n\nFor 2024, Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS) expects its total silver production to be between 21 million to 23 million ounces, while total gold production is expected to be between 880K - 1,000K ounces.\n\nA total of 22 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS). The most notable stakeholder of Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS) during this period was David Greenspan's Slate Path Capital which owns a $76 million stake in Pan American Silver Corp (NYSE:PAAS).\n\n7. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 36\n\nJim Cramer recently recommended investors to buy gold stocks. Here's what Jim Cramer said when he was asked whether Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) stock should be bought:\n\n\"When rates go up, people sell gold, and that means you should buy gold. Because we buy gold for insurance.”\n\nIn December, Barron's published a list of its favorite stock picks for 2024. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) made it to the list. Barron's likes Barrick Gold Corp's (NYSE:GOLD) plans to increase mine output by 30% by the end of the decade. Barron's thinks Barrick Gold Corp's (NYSE:GOLD) CEO Mark Bristow is the industry's \"most effective leader.\"\n\nLike GOLD, Jim Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company in its Q3 earnings call talked about guidance and future plans:\n\n\"We are expecting a further improvement in production in the fourth quarter. But as I pointed to the annual production is now expected to be marginally below the low end of the 4.2 million to 4.6 million ounce range. Copper remains on track to achieve its guidance of 420 million to 470 million pounds. As you can see here, the financial results were strong with operating cash flows growing by 35% to more than $1 billion quarter-on-quarter, free cash flow up significantly to $359 million and a 26% increase in adjusted net earnings to $0.24 per share. Barrick’s robust balance sheet secures our capacity to continue investing in our growth projects independent of the market, both new and existing, while we continue to reward our shareholders through dividends.\n\nWhile growing our business, we have also been driving a new safety culture, including a new set of standards and initiatives to keep improving this important part of our business. We call this the Journey to Zero. Sadly, this key priority was impacted by two fatalities during the quarter, which are deeply disappointing for me and the company. We remain highly motivated to achieve these Zero goals.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nIn a latest program on CNBC, while answering a question about Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA), Jim Cramer said that Moderna Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stéphane Bancel is the \"real deal.\" Cramer said that he would \"back\" Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) at the current levels.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA).\n\nEarlier this month, Goldman Sachs published a list of stocks with weak pricing power it believes can outperform. Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) made it to the list. In addition to Moderna, Jim Cramer is also bullish on  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nModerna during its Q3 earnings call talked about its guidance and future expectations:\n\nFor the U.S., we expect 2024 to be at least $2 billion and believe it will grow over time. Lastly, we expect approximately $1 billion from RSV and other international COVID sales. And finally, in 2025, we expect a return to growth. Let me finish by giving you a more fulsome view on 2024 and our thinking on 2025. Starting with 2024, as I just explained, we expect sales to be approximately $4 billion. Cost of sales are expected to be approximately 35% of sales. R&D expenses of approximately $4.5 billion in 2024, would be down 6%. In 2024, the majority of our R&D expenses are for registration trials, which are now mostly committed. I will speak to our view on 2025 R&D expenses in a moment. SG&A expenses of approximately $1.3 billion in 2024 would be down 13%.\n\nWe expect taxes to be negligible in 2024 and capital expenditures to be similar to 2023 at $0.9 billion. In summary for 2024, Spikevax will generate nearly $1 billion of income. When we combine that with our estimated investments in R&D and capital expenditures, our cash balance is projected to be approximately $9 billion at the end of 2024. Now for our preliminary thoughts on 2025. As mentioned earlier, sales will return to growth.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires 13 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now George Soros and Jim Cramer Love These Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Buy This Incredibly Cheap Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Before It Starts Soaring Like Nvidia",
        "content": "Companies that benefit from the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) have soared big time over the past year or so, but their impressive gains mean that they aren't cheap anymore.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a prime example of how an AI-fueled surge has elevated the valuations of semiconductor companies that are capitalizing on the adoption of this technology. The graphics-card specialist was trading at just under 13 times sales at the end of 2022, but its 233% gains in the past year mean that it is now trading at a much more expensive 33 times sales.\n\nThat reading is significantly higher than Nvidia's five-year average sales multiple of 20. However, the company with whose help Nvidia has dominated the AI chip market so far hasn't received much love from the market. Shares of Nvidia's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, are up just 25% in the past year.\n\nThe good part is that TSMC stock remains much cheaper than Nvidia. It is trading at 8.6 times sales and has a trailing earnings multiple of 22, which is much lower than Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 33 and earnings multiple of 78.\n\nHowever, TSMC stock might not remain cheap for long, especially after its latest quarterly results that point toward a big turnaround in the company's fortunes in 2024.\n\nLet's look at the reasons TSMC stock could follow in Nvidia's footsteps and start soaring.\n\nAI is set to drive solid growth for TSMC\n\nTSMC released its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan. 18. The company's full-year revenue fell almost 9% year over year to $69.3 billion, while earnings were down to $5.18 per share from $6.57 in 2022.\n\nThe year-over-year decline in TSMC's top and bottom lines can be attributed to the weakness in the smartphone, data center, and Internet of Things (IoT) markets last year.\n\nBut that is set to change in 2024. TSMC has guided for first-quarter revenue of $18.4 billion at the midpoint of its range, which would be a 10% increase over the prior-year period.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC's first-quarter 2023 revenue was down almost 5% from the year-ago quarter. And management forecasts 2024 revenue to increase in the low- to mid-20% range, suggesting that a solid turnaround is ahead.\n\nThis potential jump in TSMC's 2024 revenue can be credited to the growing demand for its advanced 5-nanometer (nm) and 3nm chips. The company points out that 3nm chips accounted for 15% of its revenue in the fourth quarter, up from zero in the year-ago period. The 5nm chips, which are used by the likes of Nvidia to manufacture popular AI chips such as its H100 processor, accounted for 35% of its revenue as compared to 32% in the same period last year.\n\nThe demand for these advanced chip nodes should continue increasing in 2024 and beyond, thanks to customers such as Nvidia that are going to substantially increase the production of AI chips. Supply chain rumors indicate that Nvidia could triple the output of its H100 processors this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's next-generation AI chips, code-named Blackwell, are reportedly going to be manufactured using TSMC's 3nm process in 2024 so that they can deliver even more computing power.\n\nAs it turns out, Nvidia is not the only one in line to purchase TSMC's 3nm chips. Along with Apple, which already uses the 3nm platform in its latest iPhone generation, the likes of AMD, MediaTek, and Qualcomm, are also expected to buy the 3nm chips. This is why TSMC is expected to increase the capacity utilization of the 3nm process to 80% in 2024.\n\nManagement predicted in December 2022 that its 3nm technology could help chipmakers create chips worth an estimated $1.5 trillion within five years since going into volume production. So investors can expect TSMC to keep growing quickly in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAs a result, analysts have substantially increased their growth expectations from TSMC. TSM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nExpect the stock to deliver impressive upside\n\nThe chart above suggests that TSMC could generate $112 billion in revenue in 2026. As mentioned above, it trades at 8 times sales, which is in line with its five-year average sales multiple. A similar multiple after a couple of years, along with $100 billion in annual revenue, would indicate a market cap of $896 billion, a jump of 51% from current levels.\n\nBut there is a good chance that it could trade at a much higher sales multiple considering that AI stocks such as Nvidia tend to command premium valuations. Assuming TSMC could command even half of Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 33, its market cap could jump to an impressive $1.85 trillion in a couple of years if it can achieve $100 billion in revenue. That suggests a potential upside of 212% from current levels.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that TSMC's stock could soar as AI drives stronger demand for its advanced chips, which is why investors should consider buying it before it becomes expensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Nvidia (NVDA) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.22, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.22 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 38 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 32 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.2% and 7.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs NVDA Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $12.31.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: Here Are 2 Top AI Stocks to Buy Before it Does",
        "content": "In the stock market, certain patterns tend to repeat over the long term. And if you analyze Nasdaq\r\nComposite data going back to 1971, the tech-heavy index has risen by 19% every year after a recovery year like the one in 2023. This trend suggests that 2024 could be an ideal year to buy stocks, especially as macroeconomic headwinds like inflation and high interest rates eventually start subsiding.\n\nAI-related companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) could be a great way to bet on the pattern continuing. Let's discuss their growth catalysts for this year and beyond.\n\nNvidia\n\nAfter a spectacular bull run in 2023, Nvidia also started 2024 with a bang, with its shares rising 24% in January. The company still enjoys widespread optimism about its fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) chip business. And while competition is set to increase, Nvidia still has what it takes to maintain its long-term advantages.\n\nWith an over-80% market share in the graphic processing units (GPUs) used to run and train AI applications, Nvidia has seen its operational results surge. Third-quarter revenue jumped 206% year over year to $18.12 billion, while net income increased to $680 million. Unsurprisingly, those juicy profits are attracting competition from new rivals. But Nvidia is in a prime position to maintain its lead.\n\nNvidia's longtime competitor Advanced Micro Devices wants to tackle the AI chip opportunity with its MI300x family of GPUs, launching this year. But the company expects to generate around $2 billion from the new product -- a tiny fraction of the $45 billion AI chip market. Nvidia's industry dominance also gives it an economic moat because of the significant amount of developers who are familiar with its hardware and have designed their software and servers to work best with its chips.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30, Nvidia is relatively cheap, considering its eyewatering growth rate. For context, the NASDAQ 100 has an average forward P/E of 29.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir\n\nLike Nvidia, Palantir is also enjoying a bull run, with its stock price up almost 140% over the last 12 months based on its burgeoning profitability and ambitious AI efforts. While the company doesn't produce AI chips, it is a great way for investors to bet on the adoption of the technology in government agencies and the armed forces.\n\nWhile it is tempting to focus on the surging market for AI-enabling hardware, investors shouldn't lose sight of the software side of the industry, where the tech will be adapted for various end users. Palantir's moat comes from its track record of working on highly sensitive national security missions like tracking down Osama Bin Laden in 2011 and helping the Ukrainian military with targeting during its war with Russia.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTo better serve clients, Palantir has built its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), designed to combine its legacy machine learning tools with large language models -- allowing it to give real-time insights in time-sensitive scenarios, such as a battlefield or combat mission.\n\nPalantir's third-quarter net income increased from a loss of $123.9 million to a gain of $73.4 million, capping off the company's first consecutive four quarters of profitability according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). While the stock is quite pricy with its forward P/E of 58, it should be able to scale into its valuation as its new AI growth drivers gain steam.\n\nNvidia is still the winner\n\nWhile Palantir and Nvidia both offer investors a way to bet on the continued growth and industry adoption of artificial intelligence tech, Nvidia remains the best pick for most investors. While it can be intimidating to buy a stock that has already risen so far so fast, Nvidia's current performance and future potential fully justify the rally.\n\nPalantir's respectable growth and push toward profitability are also encouraging, but its P/E multiple of 58 makes it a weaker value compared to Nvidia's P/E of just 30.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "4 Cryptocurrency Stocks to Watch Amid a Dip in Bitcoin Price",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally of 2023, which extended into this year, has somewhat come to a halt. Bitcoin (BTC) particularly has taken a hit over the past two weeks, or since Jan 10, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe approval was anticipated and the decision added further fuel to the Bitcoin rally that saw it surpass the $49,000 mark. However, the price has been on a decline since then. The market fell more than 18% over the weekend and on Jan 24, Bitcoin hovered around $40,000, a new year-to-date low.\n\nThe SEC’s approval adds a new dimension to Bitcoin trading now. It is expected to boost the overall cryptocurrency market as it will now allow retail investors to trade Bitcoin without actually owning it. However, the rally has stalled.\n\nUnderstandably, Bitcoin has entered correction territory after the ETF approval. Experts see immense potential in Bitcoin, and the launch of an ETF is expected to contribute to the long-term growth of the market.\n\nPart of the recent selling pressure on Bitcoin has been linked to sales from the FTX bankruptcy estate. The estate has reportedly sold approximately 22 million shares of Grayscale's GBTC in the past few weeks, contributing to the downward pressure on the cryptocurrency, according to a CoinDesk report.\n\nAlso, several experts believe the fluctuations in Bitcoin's price to selling by Bitcoin holders, specifically short-term traders and large holders, who decided to cash in on profits following the surge in prices last year. They believe that the approval of the ETF might be seen as a \"sell-the-news\" event.\n\nNevertheless, the current correction phase is viewed as temporary, and the recent approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month is expected to have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "Technology powers the world and makes our lives easier. But did you know that investing in technology can help drive your portfolio's value higher over time to better prepare you for retirement?\n\nTech stocks range widely, covering every aspect of the tech cycle, from the manufacture of semiconductors and graphics processing units (GPUs) to the creation of the metaverse and exploration of artificial intelligence (AI). These growth stocks are riding on the tailwind of digitalization amid a technology revolution that will enable them to post steady growth over many years.\n\nInvestors should focus on businesses that are leaders in their respective fields and enjoy long-term catalysts that allow them to grow their businesses. Here are three to consider now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nSocial media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Facebook, picture-sharing app Instagram, and chat program WhatsApp. The company has bounced back spectacularly after posting a downbeat set of earnings for 2022 as CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 to be a \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nFor the first nine months of 2023, Meta saw revenue rise 12.3% year over year to $94.8 billion. Operating income jumped nearly 35% to $30.4 billion, while net income shot up 35.2% to $25.1 billion. Free cash flow more than doubled to $32.1 billion.\n\nMeta's daily and monthly active users continue to climb, assuring the company can still grow. Daily active users for the third quarter of 2023 rose 5.1% year over year to 2.1 billion, while monthly active users inched up 3.1% year over year to three billion.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta appears to have streamlined its operations by eliminating thousands of jobs and bringing its personnel numbers down to mid-2021 levels. The company is also spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's computer chips to power research on AI projects.\n\nMeta is investing in these GPUs as it pursues its new goal of developing artificial general intelligence, all while still spending significant sums building up its vision of the metaverse, a virtual world where people can interact with one another through digital avatars.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is still early days in the quest for AI dominance, but Meta is committing its resources to build up this nascent industry where there is a long growth runway for the company to continue shining. The metaverse also represents the future of how people will interact digitally and presents compelling opportunities for the company to monetize over time.\n\nExciting days are ahead for investors as Meta's share price hits a new record high, signaling investor optimism over the company's prospects.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a GPU designer and manufacturer pioneering the accelerated computing era. The company's platform powers nearly three-quarters of the world's supercomputers and boasts 4.5 million developers. The company is riding on the generative AI wave that is seeing orders surge to new records.\n\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Nvidia saw revenue surge 85% year over year to $38.8 billion. Its operating income catapulted more than sixfold to $19.4 billion, while net income leaped fivefold to $17.5 billion. Unsurprisingly, free cash flow also exploded, going from $2.1 billion to $15.8 billion.\n\nNvidia has provided an upbeat outlook for its fourth quarter, with revenue expected to come in around $20 billion. If it achieves this forecast, it would represent a more than tripling of its fourth quarter 2023 sales of $6.1 billion.\n\nThere could be much more to come for the GPU producer. Nvidia is working with Foxconn to develop AI factories, a new category of data centers. These can power an increasing number of applications, such as AI-powered robotics platforms and language-based generative AI services.\n\nNvidia also partnered with Indian technology giants Infosys, Reliance Industries, and Tata to build India's foundation large language model (LLM) and provide infrastructure-as-a-service for AI services within the country. The GPU specialist is working with Microsoft to run custom generative AI enterprise applications on the latter's Microsoft Azure platform to allow intelligent search, summarization, and content generation.\n\nThese are just some of the collaborations Nvidia inked recently, but there is much more potential for the company to work with other players to build LLMs and spur the further evolution of generative AI. Nvidia is even working in medicine, collaborating with Genentech to develop new therapeutics by harnessing the power of generative AI.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless and should translate to many more opportunities for Nvidia to scale its business and capture more top- and bottom-line growth.\n\nPalantir\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is a software company that harnesses the power of AI to create platforms for clients to perform data analyses. Its software is used by a wide range of clients, including government agencies, manufacturing companies, financial firms, and healthcare institutions.\n\nPalantir reported a strong set of earnings for the first nine months of 2023 as revenue increased by 15.7% year over year to $1.6 billion. The business also churned out operating income and net income of $54.2 million and $120.5 million, respectively, reversing the operating and net losses in the prior year.\n\nThe current quarter also represents the software company's fourth consecutive quarter of profitability. Free cash flow for the first nine month more than tripled year over year to $400.8 million, a strong sign that shows the business can be both profitable and free-cash-flow generative.\n\nPalantir also chalked up a higher customer count, with the total jumping 34% year over year to 453. Of this group, 330 were commercial customers, representing a 45% climb. In a sign that its top 20 customers are spending more, the average trailing-12-month revenue for this group rose 13% year over year to $54 million. Billings increased by 8% to $550 million, and Palantir secured 80 deals of at least $1 million during the quarter, of which 12 were at least $10 million in value.\n\nIn January, the company signed a multi-year commercial partnership with Option Care Health for its software to be used to improve both patient outcomes and efficiency. The company's momentum in securing new business and its turnaround to profitability point to better days ahead as investors better appreciate its business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Even if you're not an investor that regularly swings for the fences, you've likely dreamed of hitting a proverbial grand slam that gets your portfolio over the seven-figure hump.\n\nThe thing is, such trades aren't as uncommon as you might think. You just have to find the right company in the right business at the right moment. Time will take care of the rest.\n\nOn that note, there's one particular technology stock that's not only already turned many patient investors into millionaires, but can continue doing so in the future. That's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Here's a closer look at why it's been such a winner thus far, and why it's poised to continue minting millionaires going forward.\n\nNvidia, up close and personal\n\nYou've probably already familiar with the company, but Nvidia hasn't always been the titan it is today. It has, however, always been a successful cutting-edge technology player.\n\nThe company was founded back in 1993... just when the personal computer era was just getting started. It wasn't until 1995, however, when it changed the landscape of the PC business forever. That's when Nvidia debuted the world's first-ever mainstream consumer-oriented graphics processing card. This tech made personal computers much more engaging, largely by making them high-powered video gaming consoles. The rest, as they say, is history. Leveraging its leading position in the graphics card space, Nvidia has since grown from its relatively small 1999 public offering to the $1.5 trillion powerhouse it is today. From back then to now, Nvidia stock's soared to the tune of 150,000%. Wow!\n\nGranted, most investors likely didn't stick with the stock that whole time. The company's been through ups and downs which would have shaken several of even the staunchest of shareholders out.\n\nNevertheless, any shareholders able to stick with their positions in the stock for any meaningful length of time during the company's existence have done very, very well for themselves. Certainly many of them have become millionaires with some help from Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut, the party's not over yet.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the next big growth engine\n\nNvidia's first couple of decades were all about graphics processing cards. The next couple, however, won't be. Artificial intelligence is its next big growth engine and will remain so for a long while.\n\nAs it turns out, the same basic computer architecture used in graphics cards is perfectly suited for AI applications. It doesn't have to handle highly complex calculations. It just needs to simultaneously handle mountains and mountains of digital data very rapidly. Recognizing this, in 2012 Nvidia began experimenting with purpose-built AI processors using its graphics card tech. The 2016 release of its DGX-1 system marked the world's first-ever deep-learning supercomputer, dropping the company right into the heart of the then-brewing artificial intelligence evolution. It was a brilliant move too. AI now accounts for around three-fourths of the organization's revenue and is responsible for the lion's share of its revenue growth.\n\nThe artificial intelligence party is just getting started though. Institutions are only just now starting to see the full potential of owning their own AI platforms. UIPath's CEO Robert Enslin recently opined that \"Companies need to think about how to apply AI and automation to all parts of their business,\" for instance, concluding that \"All companies need to be tech companies.\"\n\nThe companies he's speaking of don't seem to disagree either. Even cosmetics brand L'Oreal's chief executive Nicolas Hieronimus believes \"We are a tech company. We are a beauty company, but we are a tech company,\" as he explained at this year's annual Consumer Electronics Show held earlier this month.\n\nIn this vein, Precedence Research expects the AI hardware business to grow at a yearly pace of more than 24% between now and 2030, reaching a value of $250 billion in the final year of that stretch. The software sliver of the artificial intelligence market -- which Nvidia also serves -- is projected to swell from around $200 billion per year now to more than $1 trillion in 2032, again according to Precedence Research.\n\nAlready in control of the vast majority of the artificial intelligence hardware market, Nvidia is positioned to capture its fair share of the market's growth.\n\nJust settle in for the long haul\n\nThe backdrop is bullish to be sure. Nvidia's the leading name in one of the market's hottest long-term growth opportunities, after all. Risk is low and the potential reward is high.\n\nThere is one footnote to add to the Nvidia story though. That is, Nvidia is a popular, well-watched stock that dishes out a great deal of volatility. Shares also tend to be priced at a rich valuation, exacerbating that volatility. And these aren't limited to short-term swings. Nvidia stock can really ebb and flow for a while, even when things are clearly going well for the company.\n\nMost veteran investors understand, however, they'll need to remain plugged into mega-trends for years on end if they want to become millionaires. This truth isn't going to change for Nvidia's shareholders anytime soon either.\n\nThe thing is, it's worth the wait.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The S&P 500 index posted a solid return of 24% in 2023. While many Wall Street analysts are now projecting slower economic growth in 2024, the possibility of a recession seems to be quite low. Coupled with improving earnings projections for the S&P 500 stocks, analysts now expect the index to gain 8% to 9% in 2024 -- a little lower than the index's long-term historical average annual return of 10%.\n\nTraders do not expect the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts to start until May 2023 due to stronger-than-expected economic data and indications of a continued battle with inflation. However, once the central bank starts cutting rates, it is expected to continue to do so five times in late 2024. Subsequently, the stock market and the S&P 500 will most likely start rallying meaningfully in the latter part of 2024.\n\nThat's why now may be a good time to start taking up small positions in growth stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), which are expected to grow faster than the overall market.\n\nNvidia\n\nLast year was a rewarding one for Nvidia, with shares surging 246%. Much of this rally is attributed to Nvidia's undisputed leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. A diverse array of clients such as consumer internet firms, cloud service providers, and enterprises now rely on Nvidia's comprehensive suite of CPUs, GPUs, networking technologies, and AI-optimized software to build AI infrastructure and run enterprise AI applications.\n\nNvidia's future looks even brighter with data centers focusing on transitioning from CPU-based to GPU-based or accelerated computing-based infrastructure. This is driven by data centers focusing on increasing productivity and running power-hungry high-performance computing, data analytics, and AI workloads. CEO Jensen Huang estimated that data centers will be spending nearly $1 trillion on these investments in the next four years, translating into nearly $250 billion in capital expenditures annually. With its cutting-edge GPUs optimized for training and inferencing or real-time running of large language models and for running generative AI applications, Nvidia seems positioned to capitalize on the trend. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, a leading provider of high-performance networking technologies, in 2020 further strengthened the company's position in the data center market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is also seeing solid demand for its AI chips and software from major enterprises like Snowflake, ServiceNow, Adobe, and Databricks integrating AI assistants into their platforms. This broader trend across industries toward developing customized AI applications can prove to be a major tailwind for the company.\n\nTo leverage these opportunities, Nvidia is focusing on accelerating the pace of new architecture release for data center chips from every two years to every year. The company is also making significant inroads in the software segment and can reach an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2024 (ending Jan. 31, 2024) for its recurring software, support, and service offerings. Nvidia's software solutions are playing a major role in enabling enterprises to leverage generative AI and other AI technologies.\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia seems pretty expensive, trading at 34 times trailing 12-month sales. However, considering the huge potential of the AI opportunity and Nvidia's forte in this ever-evolving market, the company can still prove to be a smart pick in 2024 even at the elevated share price levels.\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nData analytics specialist Palantir's stock surged an impressive 167% in 2023, despite a pullback following a skeptical report from William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma. The report highlighted the decrease in the renewal value and period of the company's contract with the U.S. Army, citing \"data ownership\" issues as one of the pain points. Despite this issue, Palantir's forte in helping various government and commercial entities efficiently analyze extensive datasets and uncover hidden insights continues to be a major competitive edge.\n\nPalantir's focus on providing products and services that help combat violent and immoral actors has helped foster brand recognition and trust among its government client base. The company recently launched Palantir Government Web Services to support emerging and existing defense technology companies in scaling their mission-critical capabilities. Hence, while Palantir's government revenue grew by only 12% year over year to $308 million in the third quarter, there is still huge growth potential in this relatively stable business.\n\nPalantir also saw its third-quarter commercial revenue rise 23% year over year to $251 million, while the commercial business reached a $1 billion annualized run rate in the third quarter.\n\nFurthermore, the recently launched AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform), which integrates the company's existing machine learning capabilities with large language models, is also proving to be a major growth catalyst. The company opted for AIP Bootcamps, which allow potential clients to work on real workflows with actual client data in five or fewer days. This is a significant improvement from the traditional pilot-based go-to-market strategy, which may require one to three months. Since customers get real-time experience working with AIP, it results in faster negotiations and improved unit economics.\n\nAlthough Palantir is trading at 17.7 times the trailing 12-month sales ratio, far higher than the software industry median of 2.3, it is still an attractive buy based on its robust growth potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "A few years ago, it seemed unlikely that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) could become as valuable as Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). At the beginning of 2020, Nvidia had an enterprise value of $136 billion while Amazon was worth $889 billion.\n\nBut today, Nvidia is worth $1.46 trillion and Amazon is worth $1.60 trillion. Both of those tech giants kept growing over the past four years, but Nvidia closed in on Amazon as the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market lit a raging fire under its data center business.\n\nCould this red-hot chipmaker actually overtake the e-commerce and cloud leader by 2025? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow rapidly did Nvidia grow over the past few years?\n\nNvidia's revenue declined 7% in fiscal 2020, which ended in January 2020, as it struggled with the slower growth of the PC gaming market, the decline of cryptocurrency prices -- which drove miners to flood the market with secondhand GPUs -- and supply chain disruptions caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut in fiscal 2021, its revenue surged 53% as the gaming and AI markets heated up again. That growth continued over the following year and its revenue soared 61% in fiscal 2022.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, its revenue growth flatlined as PC sales dropped in a post-pandemic market and the macro headwinds forced data center operators to rein in their spending. By the end of the year, many analysts expected Nvidia's revenue to grow only about 10% in fiscal 2024. However, those conservative forecasts didn't account for the explosive growth of the generative AI market over the past year -- which drove many companies to accumulate Nvidia's top-tier data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks. That's why the same analysts now expect Nvidia's revenue to soar 119% to $59.1 billion in fiscal 2024 (which finalizes at the end of this month).\n\nIf Nvidia matches that target, it will have grown its annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 52.5% from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2024. Amazon is expected to grow its revenue at a CAGR of 19.4% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon also experienced a boom and bust cycle over the past four years. Its growth initially accelerated during the pandemic as more people shopped online and companies ramped up their spending on cloud-based services, but it slowed down as those tailwinds dissipated. Inflation and rising interest rates exacerbated that slowdown -- but its core e-commerce and cloud businesses have gradually stabilized over the past year.\n\nNvidia could keep growing faster than Amazon\n\nThe bulls believe Nvidia's sales will keep soaring as it sells more data center chips, which made up 80% of its revenue in its latest quarter, and its gaming business grows again. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 36% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026 as the AI market continues to expand. They also expect its EPS to grow at a CAGR of 38%.\n\nWe should take those estimates with a grain of salt since those analysts were largely blindsided by the generative AI boom, but the long-term forecasts for the AI industry reinforce that bullish outlook. The broader AI market could grow at a CAGR of 19% from 2023 to 2032, according to Precedence Research, while Fortune Business Insights believes the generative AI niche will expand at an even faster CAGR of 47.5%.\n\nNvidia's stock isn't cheap at 33 times next year's earnings, but its dominance of the growing data center and gaming GPU markets could justify that higher valuation. But Nvidia still needs to overcome some unpredictable challenges, including the latest export curbs on advanced AI chips to China; the development of first-party AI chips by major customers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI; and a potential supply glut caused by companies accumulating too many data center GPUs.\n\nYet Nvidia could still grow faster than Amazon, which is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at a CAGR of 12% and 34%, respectively, from 2023 to 2025. And at 43 times next year's earnings, Amazon's stock still looks pricier than Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia could be worth more than Amazon by 2025\n\nBased on all these facts, Nvidia could easily become more valuable than Amazon by the end of 2025. Its stock would only need to rise about 10% from its current levels to lift its enterprise value past Amazon's, and it could continue to outperform the e-commerce and cloud leader over the next two years as the AI market continues growing.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.\n\nGrowth stocks have rewarded investors over the past several years, thanks to the hyper growth and mind-numbing expansion of technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Data from the CFA Institute showed that since the end of the financial crisis, growth stocks outperformed value stocks by 144% through June 2018. The study highlighted that this massive outperformance was not a \"fluke\" since most of the growth stocks studied were trading at decent valuation multiples during 2009 and they also saw earnings growth during the period which was analyzed in the study.\n\nIn theory, growth stocks tend to underperform during a high interest rate environment when investors turn to realistic valuations and move away from risky assets. But what happened last year was the opposite of this. That means Mr. Market really cares about AI and the impact it is creating. That's why investors are still happy to buy technology stocks trading at higher multiples. Many analysts believe we are going through the beginning of the AI revolution and the AI products and services mega-cap technology companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making will have far-reaching consequences on human progress.\n\nCan Growth Stocks Continue to Outperform in 2024?\n\nFinancial markets defied all expectations last year and avoided the much-feared recession. But will the AI-related euphoria and economic resilience help the stock market this year? UBS said in its 2024 market outlook report that it would be \"historically unusual\" if the US economy ends up avoiding recession after the rate hikes of 2022 and 2023. But the report said there is a reason for optimism this time as UBS expects no significant economic contraction in 2024 even though it sees a slowdown in growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Invest in Quality Stocks with Higher Multiples?\n\nIn this environment, UBS recommended investors to pile into quality stocks. The firm said quality stocks can have higher valuations on a relative basis but it said quality stocks would be worth paying for this year.\n\n\"Quality stocks have historically outperformed in the late stages of the business cycle, including in periods of economic contraction, which should offer portfolio protection if the economy slows more than we expect. The quality tilt also aligns with our preference for US technology companies, which should be among the key beneficiaries of AI-related demand for both hardware and software. Quality stocks typically have higher valuations than the overall index, but we think that quality is worth paying for in 2024. Investors can find quality stocks within US tech; stable quality-income and high-quality cyclical stocks in Europe; and in select names in Asia.\" Hyper-Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to see which stocks with extreme revenue growth are on the radar of billionaire investors.  For this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with EPS growth of over 30% over the past five years, sales growth of over 25% over the past five years and quarter-over-quarter sales growth of over 25% posted in the most recent quarters. From these stocks we selected 11 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. To find the number of billionaire investors for these stocks we used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of billionaire investors and their stock holdings. Why care about billionaires and hedge fund managers? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11. Sunshine Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:SBFM)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 1\n\nSunshine Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:SBFM) ranks 11th in our list of the hyper-growth stocks billionaires are loading up on. In November Sunshine Biopharma Inc (NASDAQ:SBFM) posted third quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at -$0.04. Revenue in the quarter totaled $5.96 million.\n\n10. Agile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 1\n\nAgile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX) makes contraceptive products. Agile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX) posted third quarter results in November. Total revenue in the third quarter came in at $6.7 million, an increase of 122% from the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at -$1.47, beating estimates by $0.37.\n\nOne billionaire in Insider Monkey's database of billionaires had stakes in Agile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. Billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is a shareholder in Agile Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:AGRX).\n\nThe company talked in detail about its financial performance during Q3 earnings call in November:\n\n\"In the past year, we’ve seen consistent quarter-over-quarter improvements across all of our key performance areas, and we believe there is room for additional growth both in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as into the first quarter of 2024. I’ll now get into some of the details of our third quarter 2023 performance that supports our confidence in achieving our 2023 net revenue goal and generating positive cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2024. Net revenue, third quarter 2023, net revenue was $6.7 million, which represents a 21% increase from the second quarter of 2023. The continued increase in net revenue was primarily driven by our ability to once again accelerate Twirla demand across both the retail and non-retail channels.\n\nTwirla demand for the third quarter 2023 was 74,325 total cycles a 33% increase from the second quarter of 2023, a new single quarter record. Retail demand as reported by Symphony was 40,196 total cycles, a 13% increase from the second quarter of 2023, also a single quarter record. Non-retail demand was 34,129 total cycles, a 71% increase from the second quarter of 2023.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 2\n\nMassachusetts-based Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO) ranks ninth in our list of the hyper-growth stocks to buy according to billionaires.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Spero Therapeutics Inc's (NASDAQ:SPRO) revenue jumped about 1175% on a year over year basis.\n\nTwo billionaires in Insider Monkey's billionaires database had stakes in Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO). Billionaires Israel Englander and Jim Simons had stakes in Spero Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SPRO) through their hedge funds.\n\nThe company's management talked about important business updates and its cash position during Q3 earnings call in November 2023:\n\nSpero is well capitalized with a strong financial position of $93.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023. This includes the $30 million milestone we announced on our last earnings call, which has now been received as part of the Tebipenem HBr License Agreement with GSK. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund the company into the second half of 2025. We reported total third quarter revenues of $25.5 million compared with revenues of $2 million in the third quarter of 2022, a $23.5 million increase compared to the prior year period that was primarily a result of the $23.2 million of collaboration revenue related to the license agreement with GSK.\n\nCurrent revenue was $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $0.9 million in the same period in 2022. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2023 were $16.4 million compared with $7.4 million in research and development expenses for the same period in 2022. This $9 million year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher direct costs related to the Tebipenem HBr and SPR720 programs. These included increased clinical activity related to our ongoing Phase 2a trial of SBR720, as well as startup clinical activities and increased preclinical activities related to the planned Phase 3 trial of Tebipenem HBr. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2023 of $5.7 million were lower than the $6.6 million reported in the same period in 2022.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n8.

        "title": "Top 7 Value Stocks to Outperform Growth in 2024",
        "content": "2024 could easily turn into the year that value stocks come out on top. Though “official” numbers say differently, there’s a clear sense of unease as tech-heavy indices soar to all-time highs despite wide-ranging layoffs pointing to troubled economic conditions. To be fair, the best growth companies adapted to higher interest rates and right-sized operations to enter 2024 stronger than before.\n\nBut value stocks remain overlooked despite being the perfect asset for a questionable recovery.\n\nBroadly speaking, value stocks are mature companies with demonstrated markets, quality products, consistent profitability, and quality cash flow. They usually offer a dividend, as well. Over the past few years, those companies had their spotlight stolen by high-flying growth stocks, leaving many materially undervalued, including:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAT&T (T) A digital illustration of the telecom industry.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) is among the top growth-oriented value stocks as it expands its vision for an interconnected world. Critically, the company is a major backer of AST SpaceMobile’s (NASDAQ:ASTS) satellite-based cell service venture that should see a commercial launch in 2024. But that isn’t the only tailwind supporting AT&T’s ascent in 2024.\n\nToday, the company posted its Q4 earnings report. While earnings fell below expectations, the report did shed light on solid growth. For example, wireless service revenue climbed nearly 4% year over year, indicating the company successfully navigated tight economic conditions to keep subscriber counts high while accounting for necessary price improvements. That’s evident from AT&T’s higher-than-expected postpaid phone net adds, which describes how many “new” customers signed up for an AT&T plan. The quarterly stat hit 526,000 compared to 487,500 as anticipated. This figure is especially notable since the market is (thus far) fairly well saturated.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisis\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Roman Bodnarchuk\n\nStory continues\n\nRenewed real estate optimism is setting Home Depot (NYSE:HD) up for a strong 2024.\n\nMoving forward, Home Depot plans to construct 80 new stores over the next five years. This expansion reflects management’s expectation of increasing demand throughout the 2020s and positions the company to capitalize on the anticipated surge in renovations and new constructions.\n\nHome Depot’s commitment to dividend growth is evident, with a consistent increase in its annual dividend over the past decade and a 50% higher distribution rate than five years ago. A payout ratio of 0.52 shows a balanced approach: rewarding shareholders while maintaining enough cash for business growth. A tad undervalued, Home Depot is one of the most stable value stocks available today.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY, NTDOF) A close-up shot of hands playing a video game on a mobile phone.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA global gaming stock might not seem like a contender for top value stock status, but Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY, OTCMKTS:NTDOF) is truly unique. 2023 saw a slew of bullish Nintendo news that, if the trend continues, could create conditions for the stock’s stratospheric rise in 2024.\n\nNintendo’s big news came on the heels of the Super Mario Bros Movie success, which grossed $1.36 billion and highlighted what some of us have been saying is Nintendo’s biggest strength – its largely untapped intellectual property catalog. That forecast bore fruit as the company announced an imminent Zelda movie on the heels of its prior success, creating an effective flywheel to monetize existing properties and drive new interests toward old products.\n\nFurther adding to Nintendo’s appeal are leaked emails from a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) court case, revealing Microsoft’s substantial interest in either partnering with or acquiring Nintendo. These emails, dating back to 2020, may not have led to any tangible developments, but they underscore the significant corporate interest in Nintendo. This interest places Nintendo in a strong position to leverage its brand and assets for significant growth in 2024.\n\nNintendo also exhibits exceptional financial management, critical for any value stock consideration. Commended in the Microsoft emails for its sound management, the company boasts a significant cash reserve, ensuring its ability to weather economic uncertainties and seize emerging opportunities. With a current total yield of 2.57%, Nintendo is particularly attractive to value investors, offering a stable return while they await the stock’s imminent repricing.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT), a leading medical device manufacturer and blue-chip healthcare stock, stands out as an excellent choice for value investors interested in healthcare. Despite a relatively flat performance for most of 2023, the stock popped in 2024 and returned 2.75% since the year began. Looking forward, the company’s prospects far surpass its current modest performance, presenting an attractive entry point for investors.\n\nThe latest earnings report from Medtronic reveals a solid growth trajectory post-pandemic, a contrast to many healthcare stocks, with a staggering 112%% increase in GAAP earnings year-over-year. The company’s commitment to innovation, coupled with its deep value characteristics, indicates significant potential for upside.\n\nA key aspect of Medtronic’s future growth lies in its foray into artificial intelligence in healthcare. The early 2023 collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop AI-driven platform solutions should see widespread market adoption by 2024. This development is promising for investors who have remained patient through the stock’s recent period of stagnation.\n\nAdditionally, Medtronic’s current dividend yield of 3.2% further cements its position as an attractive value stock. It offers a blend of stability and potential for growth, making it a compelling investment for 2024.\n\nSturm Ruger (RGR) a photo of some guns and ammunition\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGun sales tend to surge in election years. Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) is a value stock ready to capitalize on the trend. Trading at a meager 13x earnings, 2x book value, and 1.4x sales, this small-cap value stock is set for a solid run in 2024.\n\nThe company struggled in 2023 because, in the words of CEO Christopher Kilroy, “Our third quarter sales and profitability decreased from last year, as overall firearms demand declined, creating a challenging, promotion-rich marketplace.”\n\nBut gun sales hit an all-time high in 2020 amid the election, more than doubling the rate in 2012 during President Obama’s second run. Good, bad, or indifferent – political motivations shouldn’t sway investor opinion. However, when it comes to making money, RGR is poised to pop as we enter yet another contentious election season.\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nAs tax season approaches, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) emerges as another value stock poised for growth. Last year, the company faced uncertainties due to rumors about the IRS potentially launching a free national tax filing service. However, HRB has since made a remarkable recovery and is now strategically positioned to dominate the tax return sector and explore additional revenue streams.\n\nHRB launched a mobile banking service at the year’s start to counteract the seasonal nature of its tax-related revenue. By April 2023, this initiative had garnered substantial customer interest, with 291,000 users and over $280 million in deposits. Additionally, HRB’s small-business accounting service saw a 10% increase in year-over-year revenue. These strategic diversifications indicate a strong commitment to stabilizing cash flow, a typical challenge for tax-centric companies aiming for a more consistent revenue stream year-round.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) skillfully navigated 2023’s labor disputes while maintaining profitability, making it among the best value stocks when it comes to car companies. Though the labor deal will likely exceed $9 billion, GM also announced a $10 billion stock buyback and a 33% increase in its dividend in its end-of-year earnings announcement. This strategy elevates GM’s total yield to $5.34, an impressive figure, especially considering that its shares have fallen nearly 10% in the past six months. This decline positions GM as an underpriced value stock with unlimited upside.\n\nThe long-term outlook for GM is optimistic, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. The company has reported a 33% YoY increase in EV sales. With six EV models currently available and more in development, GM is steadily establishing itself as a significant contender in the EV market, despite still lagging behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe broad automotive sector does seem a bit rocky, still, and EV popularity is on a downswing. Despite these uncertainties, this undervalued car company emerges as a top choice among 2024’s value stocks and one of the best within the EV sector (besides, of course, Musk’s crown jewel).\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Before the Fed Cuts Rates in March",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve is expected to announce lower rates during its March meeting. That March FOMC meeting takes place over a two-day span from March 19th to the 20th. During this time, it can be hard to find stocks to buy. However, these ones are certainly worth considering grabbing beforehand.\n\nThe stock market should rally on lower rates since the cost of borrowing money will go down. Companies can then tap into more leverage and refinance their existing debt to secure lower interest rates.\n\nSome stocks are better suited for a decrease in the Effective Federal Funds Rate. Growth stocks tend to gain the most from these policies, and you may want to consider these three picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCloudflare (NET) An illustration a Cloudflare (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) helps make the internet more secure by offering cloud services. The company has more than 182,000 paying customers who range from small businesses to publicly traded companies. Approximately 30% of Fortune 1,000 companies use Cloudflare to keep their websites secure.\n\nCloudflare offers enticing revenue growth and is narrowing its losses. The cloud services provider reported 32.3% year-over-year net income growth. The firm also reduced its net losses by 44.7% year-over-year.\n\nThe Fed’s decision to lower rates can help Cloudflare turn the corner and become a profitable enterprise. This shift would increase the stock’s value proposition for investors.\n\nCloudflare is also a momentum stock, the type of asset that can rally higher than the market on good macroeconomic news. The company’s shares increased by 78% over the past year and are up by 352% over the past five years. Cloudflare is likely to march higher if the Fed cuts rates in March.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLower interest rates encourage businesses to take more risks and reach more people. Rather than playing defense and looking for cost-cutting measures, companies may put more money into advertisements due to lower rates. They will feel more comfortable using leverage to offer a new product or service and use search engine advertisements for additional exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a primary beneficiary of this trend. The company has the largest search engine and video platform under the same umbrella. For years, Alphabet has been one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nAd revenue already ticked up in 2023 compared to 2022. For instance, Alphabet reported 11% year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2023. That’s an improvement from 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 2022.\n\nAlphabet’s Google Cloud division would also benefit from lower interest rates. Potential clients would have more financial flexibility to use Google Cloud. Existing clients may also decide to increase their annual payments to access more features.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at the center of a megatrend. The demand for artificial intelligence is heating up and has sent this stock soaring by 233% over the past year. Shares have gained an even more impressive 1,386% over the past five years.\n\nLower interest rates will give more businesses the extra funds to invest in artificial intelligence tools and initiatives. That bodes well for Nvidia, and even with sky-high interest rates, the company has grown massively.\n\nNvidia reported 206% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The company’s revenue also exhibited 34% sequential revenue growth. Net income growth was even better. A 49% sequential gain and a 588% year-over-year gain demonstrate the high potential of this stock.\n\nGrowth rates won’t stay that high forever, but lower interest rates can give these incredible growth rates some room to continue. Nvidia has been a winner in the AI industry, and lower interest rates will help Nvidia expand its position. If the stocks to buy we mentioned, this is where you should start.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NET and NVDA.

        "content": "In today’s volatile market, analyst-approved tech stocks continue to be a popular choice for investors of all experience levels. In this context, locating gold nuggets in the tech sector is like discovering a treasure map in the digital world. These equities, which have been carefully examined and recommended by professionals, are not only investments; they are also future-oriented innovators. Their appeal is indisputable; in a world driven by technology, they are essential actors rather than just blank spaces in a portfolio.\n\nBut there are certain detours and turns to be encountered when navigating the tech stock landscape. Due to the market’s dynamic nature, which frequently results in volatility and unpredictability, investor caution is essential. The art is in the balance: realizing these stocks’ promise while negotiating their complexity. Tech stocks that have been recommended by analysts stand out in this situation because they provide some consistency and insight in an otherwise erratic industry.\n\nWhat makes investing in analyst-approved tech stocks so tempting is the careful balance between enthusiasm and prudence. A symphony of possibility and caution, each stock narrates a tale of technical growth, market trends, and investor hopes.

Analysts overwhelmingly favor the stock, evidenced by 35 buy recommendations. This solid analyst backing underscores Nvidia’s stable market stance.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, Nvidia’s corporate culture contributes to its success.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong tech equities that analysts recommend, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) stands out for having had an amazing five-year run. Its roughly 197% return demonstrates both its sound financial standing and astute strategic judgment. Intuit just earned $2.47 per share, above profit projections.\n\nIntuit decided to strategically increase its quarterly dividend to 90 cents per share. The company’s trust in its financial stability is shown in this 15% rise from the previous year. It projects between 11% and 12% sales growth for the fiscal second quarter of 2024.\n\nWith creative advertisements like “Make Your Moves Count” for TurboTax, Intuit has demonstrated its dedication to utilizing AI technology. By using this strategy, it not only strengthens its position in the fintech industry but also improves its product offerings. Additionally, one of the biggest successes for small businesses has been the seamless integration of QuickBooks Live Tax and TurboTax. From an investing perspective as well as a public interest one, all of these events are noteworthy.\n\nThe well-known financial software company has recently attracted significant attention from Wall Street analysts. Based on evaluations by 18 analysts in the past three months, Intuit’s stock holds a promising outlook. The consensus among these analysts is overwhelmingly positive, with 16 analysts rating it as a ‘Buy’ and two suggesting to ‘Hold,’ while none recommend selling the stock. This strong endorsement reflects a confident view of the company’s performance and potential growth.\n\nStarbucks Corp (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), a well-known brand in the coffee sector, has done well throughout the last five years. It has outperformed many of its counterparts with a return of 37%. This exhibits an exceptional level of resilience in the face of the present market turbulence. Impactful community participation is a priority for the organization in addition to financial success.\n\nStarbucks enhances its neighborhood relationships using programs such as Starbucks Neighborhood Champions and The Starbucks Foundation’s Neighborhood Grants. This kind of engagement improves its brand perception, which appeals to investors and customers alike. Starbucks’ financial projections have been revised upward in response to analyst feedback. The projected earnings report bolstered Starbucks’ financial health, which indicates a notable year-over-year gain in revenue and EPS.\n\nThe company strikes a balance between strong financial success and social responsibility as a global leader in coffee. This approach is in accordance with the goals of investors looking for IT firms that have been suggested by analysts and have a sustainable edge. Starbucks is now rated as cautiously hopeful by analysts, who have mixed “Buy” and “Hold” recommendations. The average price goal for Starbucks Corp.’s stock is set at $108.83 in the 12-month projection by leading experts. This target suggests an upside of 18% from its current price.\n\nOverall, Starbucks is a good investment option in a difficult economic environment, as the forecasted price goal indicates, which points to an upward potential.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "*\n\nFirst quarterly operating profit in a year after severe downturn\n\n*\n\nOutperforming market due to chips for AI\n\n*\n\nRevenue surged 47%\n\n(Writes through with analyst comment and earnings details)\n\nBy Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang\n\nSEOUL, Jan 25 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix Inc said on Thursday it will focus on high-end memory semiconductors used in artificial intelligence chipsets this year after strong demand drove a surprise profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe world's second-biggest memory chipmaker which counts AI-chip leader Nvidia as a key client reported an operating profit of 346 billion won ($259.8 million) for the October-December quarter. Revenue soared 47%.\n\nThat beat expectations for a 192 billion won operating loss and marked its first operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. It had logged a loss of 1.9 trillion won a year earlier.\n\n\"We achieved (a) turnaround...following a protracted downturn, thanks to our technological leadership in the AI memory space,\" CFO Kim Woohyun said in a statement, adding that the company would strive to \"grow into a total AI memory provider\".\n\nSK Hynix's advanced DRAM chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are in high demand for use in the graphic processing units (GPUs) made by Nvidia and others that process vast amounts of data in generative AI.\n\nThe company said its sales of HBM3 chips - which it developed ahead of rivals - increased by more than fivefold in 2023 from a year earlier.\n\nWith demand set to grow from clients like Nvidia, cloud service providers and other big tech firms as AI functions are increasingly incorporated into devices, SK Hynix's lead in HBM chip development is set to help it improve profitability and outperform the market this year, analysts said.\n\n\"For hot (AI) products, demand is so strong that clients are complaining they can't get enough supplies. It's a completely different story for the rest of the memory industry which is slowly recovering from weak demand,\" Greg Roh, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoh estimated that HBM chips will climb to account for 15% of industry-wide DRAM sales this year, up from 8% in 2023.\n\nSK Hynix plans to begin mass production of its next HBM version, called HBM3E, in the first half of the year. It is also developing the next-generation chip called HBM4.\n\nThe company's shares, which have surged 18% since its last quarterly earnings release on the upbeat outlook for AI memory chips, fell 2.6% in afternoon trade due to profit-taking, analysts said.\n\nFor the wider market, SK Hynix said chip prices will improve this year as clients need to restock and manufacturers will continue to cut legacy chip production. Its fourth-quarter results were helped by restocking demand from Chinese mobile phone makers.\n\nBigger rival Samsung Electronics is also expected to flag improving memory chip demand when it reports detailed fourth-quarter results on Jan. 31.\n\n($1 = 1,331.9400 won) (Reporting by Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Stephen Coates and Edwina Gibbs)",

        "content": "Famous investors such as Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch agree that you only need to hit homeruns with one or two stocks to make a lot of money. A single stock can make an investor’s career and lead them to riches. These are often referred to as compounders, stocks that consistently beat the market over many years, driven higher by incredible earnings growth and profitability. Consider that $10,000 invested in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on the day that it held its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997 would be worth more than $16 million today, and it gives you a sense of the impact that one well-placed investment decision can have on a person’s life. The good news is that there are many stocks today that are compounders and whose growth is crushing the broader market. Here are three growth stocks to turn $100,000 into $1 million: January 2024.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe stock of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is defying the laws of gravity. The company, which makes high-efficiency computer servers, is the hottest thing in the market right now. Three weeks into the new year, and SMCI stock is up 58%. That brings its gain over the last 12 months to 510%, more than double the growth in the stock of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with which it has a partnership. Through five years, SMCI stock is up an astounding 2,900%.\n\nIf any stock can help investors turn $100,000 into $1 million, it is Super Micro Computer. The company’s share price has been surging ever since it announced a partnership with Nvidia last year. More recently, the company pre-announced better-than-expected financial results and raised its forward guidance on growing demand for its servers, which is being driven by the boom in artificial intelligence (AI). Of course there’s a risk anytime a stock runs this hot. But, right now, SMCI stock looks unstoppable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother stock that continues to enjoy impressive growth is software company Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG). The company’s shares rose 28% in a single trading session late last year after it reported better-than-expected third-quarter financial results and raised its full-year guidance. So far in 2024, DDOG stock has added another 13%, bringing its 12-month return to 72%. Since going public in 2019, the company’s share price has more than tripled.\n\nDatadog, whose software is used in cloud computing, most recently reported earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents, beating consensus forecasts of 34 cents. Revenue during Q3 came in at $547.5 million, up 25% from a year earlier and beating Wall Street estimates that called for sales of $524.1 million. Datadog also raised its full-year guidance, saying it expects Q4 revenue of $564 million to $568 million, and full-year revenue of $2.1 billion. Both figures exceeded consensus analyst forecasts.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother area of the market that continues to be hot is cybersecurity. And leading the pack of cybersecurity stocks is Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). So far in 2024, PANW has risen 20%, bringing its 12-month gain to 130%. In the last five years, the company’s share price has climbed nearly 400%, making it a strong growth stock and one to turn $100,000 into $1 million. Like Super Micro Computer and Datadog, PANW stock has been supercharged by earnings in recent quarters.\n\nIn November, Palo Alto Networks reported EPS of $1.38, which was better than the $1.16 forecast among analysts. Revenue in the quarter amounted to $1.88 billion, up 20% from a year ago and above Wall Street forecasts of 1.84 billion. Looking ahead, Palo Alto Networks forecast revenue of $1.955 billion to $1.985 billion, in line with analyst views for $1.97 billion of revenue for the current first quarter of 2024.

        "content": "By many metrics, we’re already in a bull market. Stocks have reached new all-time highs in most indices, with investors focused on S&P 500 returns cheering a return to new highs. In this period called the “Usain Bolt” era, stocks return to posting new records on a seemingly daily basis.\n\nThat’s great for investors, as a bull market signifies rising prices in financial markets. Various stocks and traded assets are seeing their valuations balloon. Investors feel wealthy and potentially stimulate more economic activity. Whether that’s a good or bad thing for the Federal Reserve in its battle against inflation remains to be seen. But consumer confidence is on the rise, and many metrics point to what could be a strong year in 2024.\n\nWith that perspective, let’s look at growth stocks that could benefit most from this environment in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q3 2023,Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) outperformed predictions, achieving a 25.48% revenue growth, totaling $1.71 billion. With net income at $718 million and $0.55 in diluted earnings per share, Shopify surpassed industry estimates 65.76% on the bottom line and 2.64% on the top. The e-commerce platform provider is on a robust growth trajectory. It’s boosted its expanded partnership with Google to enhance user experience and business coverage.\n\nIn July 2023, Shopify introduced new AI tools like Sidekick and Shopify Magic to empower merchants, aiming to enhance business growth. The company envisions exciting prospects for the next five years, emphasizing AI accessibility for businesses of all sizes.\n\nIn other recent news, Manhattan Associates and Shopify have partnered to elevate omnichannel shopping experiences for retailers.

The stock surged 194%, ranking second in terms of S&P 500 performance. With a market capitalization of over $980 billion, Meta eyes rejoining the trillion-dollar club, banking on AI and the metaverse. CEO Zuckerberg faces challenges to prove the company’s long-term success, but Meta’s fundamentals make this stock a screaming buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car.

        "content": "2024 is shaping up to be a strong year for Wall Street. The economy continues to improve and it may very well be that we entirely avoid a recession. The Federal Reserve is projecting multiple rate cuts which is the most prominent factor serving as evidence for bullishness. Thus, the search for stocks that could double is a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nThere is never a shortage of stocks available to investors that are predicted to double in price. Investors can easily find any number of penny stocks and multiple predictions of prices that are anticipated to double. However, the stocks listed in this article are not penny stocks. Instead, this list includes many well-established stocks that Wall Street predicts can double in 2024.\n\nFiverr International (FVRR) The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: Temitiman / Shutterstock.com\n\nFiverr International (NYSE:FVRR) operates one of the leading platforms serving a rapidly growing gig economy. Employers and employees continue to move away from traditional workplace norms which has opened an opportunity for Freelancers and other gig economy workers. The result is that Fiverr International is experiencing reasonable growth and is expected to double this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFiverr International’s platform covers 10 verticals and more than 600 categories connecting freelancers to projects on every corner of the globe. Fiverr International is a fundamentally strong firm which is a prime reason to consider investing in its stock.\n\nThe company’s top-line growth eclipsed 12% during the third quarter. That clearly doesn’t place the company in the realm of hypergrowth stocks but what the company has going in its favor is profitability. During the third quarter the company reported positive net income. The company also reported positive net income two quarters prior. It’s clear that FIverr International is on the precipice of sustained profitability which bodes well for the company and is a positive reflection on the continued growth of the gig economy overall.\n\nStory continues\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) MTCH stock: the Match group logo on a computer screen with a phone displaying its site\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) is the leading online dating apps stock and one that is widely expected to double in 2024. Consensus forecasts anticipate that the company will increase in value by more than 35% over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. However, more bullish forecasts anticipate that MTCH shares will more than double over that time period.\n\nThe company oversees a portfolio of dating apps and companies including Match, Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge among others. The company is undergoing a period of transition that could Propel its shares higher. Match Group has installed a new CEO in Faye Iosotaluno. Iosotaluno intends to leverage AI and other technologies in an effort to turn around the company which has been without a full-time CEO since 2022.\n\nThe company is also linked to recent investment from Elliott Management to the tune of $1 billion. It’s likely that increased fees could result from the investment which in turn promises to improve the company’s flagging results.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has rapidly evolved into one of the most interesting beverage stocks. While there is a slim likelihood that its shares double in 2024 that does remain a distinct possibility. However, investors should simply consider Celsius Holdings due to the fundamental strength of the brand and its recent growth.\n\nThe company sells so-called functional drinks which are generally very low calorie and include substantial vitamin and mineral content. Those beverages have garnered a large audience which is evidenced by the fact that the company reported $385 million of product sales in the third quarter. That was an all-time high for the company and represented a 104% increase overall.\n\nOf the company’s $385 million in Q3 revenues, $371 million were attributable to the North American market. That fact alone should provide some insight into its future potential. There is a large untapped international market for its beverages.\n\nFurthermore, Celsius Holdings has reached profitability in 2023 after reporting substantial losses throughout 2022.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock has all the potential in the world to double in 2024. In fact, ALB shares are forecast to more than triple based on the high analyst target price given on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for lithium however has been weak for months. As a result, the share prices of major lithium producers including Albemarle continue to be very low. It’s here that a contrarian mindset could pay huge dividends. Speaking of dividends, Albemarle is a reasonable choice in that regard. The company is a well-known dividend aristocrat and provides a dividend currently yielding 1.3%.\n\nSome pundits expect that lithium prices could rebound this year. Meanwhile, Albemarle is restructuring and intends to reduce capital expenditures in the near term. The news slightly negatively affected the price but the greater truth is that Albemarle is the largest lithium producer globally. It is a near certainty that it will rebound in price beginning sometime this year and into 2025. The only reason to realistically bet against that is under the premise that the electric vehicle industry fails entirely.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car retail store with customers. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) Is one of the strongest challengers to Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) dominance within the EV sector. Simply put, Li Auto is something of an outlier in that it is operating very well amidst a greater downturn. Electric vehicle manufacturers are currently facing delays and value dilution. While the sector is at a seminal juncture, Li Auto continues to thrive.\n\nRevenues increased by 271% during the most recent quarter and the company is profitable. That truth differentiates it from domestic rivals and also makes it an interesting competitor to tesla.\n\nIn fact, the company has outsold Tesla in its home market of China during recent periods. That’s particularly positive given the strong reception of electric vehicles in China. The country is home to the largest EV market globally and one that is also marked by strong growth rates overall. China also continues to offer a favorable subsidy environment for electric vehicles that benefits the company and its continued growth.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it may seem strange to assert that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double in 2024 following its historic year in 2023, that is indeed the case. Analysts on Wall Street believe that the AI leader’s shares could rise to $1,100 in 2024.\n\nOne reason to believe that that may be the case lies in recent announcements from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). The company, which operates the largest foundry globally, announced that it expects revenues to increase by 20% in 2024. The company produces more than half of chips globally and is a major partner of Nvidia. The news suggests that demand for Nvidia’s chips could be very strong this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia will release its updated h200 chip in 2024. That chip will improve upon its h100 chip which is extremely popular. It all points to the notion that Nvidia’s historic run in 2023 may have only been in the beginning.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) An image of hydrogen fuel silos standing against a blue sky\n\nSource: Audio und werbung / Shutterstock\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is an attractive choice in the growing hydrogen economy. The stock represents a company that manufactures and sells onsite power generation platforms that can run on hydrogen.\n\nIt’s also a stock that has the potential to more than double based on Wall Street’s expectations. The company and its stock are certainly worth looking at on the basis of pure fundamentals. Revenues increased by more than 37% during the most recent period, rising above $400 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloom Energy cut its operating losses in half, falling from $103.7 million to $51.1 million during the same period.\n\nThe hydrogen economy will come into sharper focus in the coming years. When burned, hydrogen produces no carbon dioxide. Further, the production of hydrogen produces relatively less greenhouse gas.\n\nImportantly, Bloom Energy is becoming relatively established in relation to its stock price. Its ability to produce massive revenues have propelled its shares out of penny stock territory and into a much more stable position.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As Wall Street braces for a Biden—Trump rematch in November, Portfolio Wealth Advisors President Lee Munson warns that while neither candidate is good news for Nvidia, Trump could pose a bigger risk.\n\n“One thing to remember is both Trump and Biden have taken harsh stances towards china, but President Biden is a little more diplomatic,” Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. “When you look at Trump, he's mercurial and could just cut off the tap…. And tell Nvidia they can’t sell anything.”\n\nMunson added: \"Trump could very quickly turn against China, and all of a sudden you have a situation that would be very bad for stocks like Nvidia.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Biden administration restricted the sale of more AI chips to China, including Nvidia's advanced A800 and H800 AI chips.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, former President Trump's New Hampshire win further solidifying his dominance as the leading GOP candidate for the 2024 presidential election. Now gets us closer to that potential Biden and Trump rematch, what we saw play out in 2020.\n\nAnd if Trump wins in the general election, we likely obviously will expect big changes in policy. One of that is the US's stance towards China. Let's talk about this and what it could potentially mean here for investors. For that, we want to bring in the Lee Munson, who's very closely following the impact on the markets. He's Portfolio Wealth Advisors President and Chief Investment Officer.\n\nLee, it's great to see you. I'm just going to toss it to you on this overarching theme. And specifically, what we're talking about with China is Trump or is Biden better for a company like NVIDIA, given the stance that we've seen from both in the past?\n\nLEE MUNSON: I don't think either is good. You've got 20%, 25%-- NVIDIA's a little cagey about the stats of data centers sales to China. So I think that one thing to remember is both Trump and Biden have had harsh stances on China. Here's what the problem is.\n\nStory continues\n\nBiden is obviously a little bit more diplomatic. Biden obviously rolls a little slower. And that's not a joke on his competency. But when you look at Trump, he's mercurial. Trump could just cut off the tap. Trump could just say to NVIDIA, you can't sell anything.\n\nWhereas with the Biden administration has basically said, you know, you've got these things called the H100, the A100-- these are little chips that NVIDIA sells. And last year, we started seeing that they had to unveil lesser, weaker versions of that. And so far, the Biden administration, the US government, is fine having NVIDIA sell watered down chips. And if they want to do anything else, they have to say, mother, may I.\n\nI think with Trump, that's not going to work. I think Trump could very quickly turn against China. And then all of a sudden, you have an embargo. And that would be very bad for stocks like NVIDIA.\n\nBRAD SMITH: What is the impact to US companies who still have some reliance, or in some cases, an outsized reliance in their revenue base on China if we were to see a kind of pullback or perhaps patriation more so of just the international relations policy that we have if Trump were to get back into office?\n\nLEE MUNSON: I think it's going to accelerate what Trump started when he was president first. I think it's going to accelerate what Biden continues to do. I think the message here is that Biden has not been friendly to China, but Trump's going to be even worse. And so that acceleration is going to happen.\n\nI think we have to remember, China's been a problem for about 2 and 1/2 years. Starting in August of 2021, when the president-- their leader for life now-- started talking about common prosperity, which is not what any red-blooded American capitalist wants to hear. And I think that we've already begun, over the last seven years, a deglobalization and where we have a multi-polar world.\n\nNow not to get too wonky on the topic, but I think no matter who wins, Trump is just going to accelerate it going forward for the next four years. Relationships are not going to get better with China. And I think companies that rely on China for sales, companies that rely on China for supply chains, they're going to continue to have to adapt and reshore, different shore, and find any shore but China going forward.\n\nNow the problem with that, it's the second largest economy. Nobody really wants to do that. We still do billions in trade. But if we get a wingnut in the president-- in the White House, and we get some guy that wants to shoot from the hip and shoot off his mouth, the variability of outcomes for those companies that rely on China for whatever-- it's going to cause more volatility. And you know, volatility means the stock price not always going up.",

The company’s guidance suggests revenue growth will come in at 6%-7% for the entire fiscal year.\n\nRevenue growth isn’t booming, but the company is still expanding and has a decent forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26. Shares are flat over the past year but have gained 76% over the past five years. The company recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $1.25 per share to $1.40 per share. That represents a 12% YOY increase in the dividend payout, making it one of the good high-yield dividend stocks for investors to consider.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) a cityscape at sunrise connected by 1's and 0's with implied internet connection points. representing ayx stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), might not have the highest dividend yields out there, but the stock still has a respectable 1.75% yield. Shares have more than doubled over the past year and are up 367% over the past five years.\n\nThe semiconductor firm is hitting its stride as more businesses jump into artificial intelligence (AI). Broadcom offers an advanced AI chip that can handle the higher bandwidth required for artificial intelligence tools.\n\nBroadcom also boasts exceptional dividend growth. The company hiked its quarterly dividend from $4.60 to $5.25 at the end of 2023. That represents a 14.1% YOY increase, a normal occurrence for the company. Broadcom’s quarterly dividend payout has roughly doubled from 2019 to 2023. During that stretch, the quarterly payout went from $2.65 per share to $5.25 per share.\n\nBroadcom is starting the year on a good note with a 15% year-to-date (YTD) gain. The firm is gaining momentum as other key players in artificial intelligence have expressed optimism about its earnings and the industry. Given the company’s potential, investors looking for high-yield dividend stocks should take a look at AVGO.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has the highest dividend yield on this list at nearly 4%. Although the company has a P/E ratio under 10, low valuations are normal for oil companies. Exxon Mobil had a rough 2023 that featured declining revenue and earnings. However, an upswing is likely in 2024.\n\nOil prices dictate Exxon Mobil’s earnings, and higher oil prices can lead to higher profits. Inflation ticked higher in December. One slightly higher inflation reading isn’t enough to spook investors, but conflicts in the Red Sea region can result in meaningful inflation.\n\nThe conflict in the Red Sea is currently disrupting the Suez Canal shipping route. This development has increased the amount of time it takes for vessels to arrive at their destinations. That also means more fuel is being used which subsequently raises shipping prices. All of those extra expenses will translate into higher costs for various goods.\n\nThe conflict has been taking place since October 2023. Oil has always been a good hedge for inflation since it is a commodity. Exxon Mobil performed well in 2022 when many stocks tumbled and can be a good pick among high-yield dividend stocks if inflation and higher oil prices return.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ADP and AVGO.

        "content": "U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has achieved significant financial gains from her recent investment in Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a prominent company in artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors. On Nov. 22, Pelosi acquired 50 call options for Nvidia with a strike price of $120, expiring on Dec. 20, 2024. The transaction value ranged between $1 million and $5 million​​.\n\nAs of early 2024, Pelosi has reportedly made nearly $500,000 from this investment, surpassing her annual government salary of approximately $223,500. This gain is attributed to Nvidia’s stock performance, which has seen an increase of over 21% in value since Pelosi’s acquisition​​, according to Finbold.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch? Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden. How to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024? These investors have the latest tips.\n\nPelosi’s investment in Nvidia has drawn attention because of her track record of successful trades in Congress. Along with her husband, a venture capitalist, Pelosi has made substantial profits from trading call options in various blue-chip companies. However, her stock trades often face scrutiny, with some accusing her of using insider information to make lucrative trades​​.\n\nPelosi’s investment decisions and their timing have been a topic of debate. While some criticize her for potential insider trading, others commend her strategic investment choices. The rise in Nvidia’s stock value, partly because of the high demand for its chips in AI computing, has contributed significantly to Pelosi’s recent financial success from this investment​​.\n\nNvidia has impacted sectors like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, semiconductors and gaming. Founded in 1993, the company has evolved from a primary focus on high-end gaming graphics processing units (GPUs) to a broad presence in autonomous vehicles and data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the company’s financial performance was outstanding, with a third-quarter revenue of $18.1 billion and a net income of $9.2 billion. This success is largely because of its strategic focus on AI and accelerated computing, with key products like the H100 GPU and the Grace Hopper H200 AI Superchip. Nvidia’s collaboration with Microsoft Corp.’s Azure for cloud-based AI solutions and its significant data center revenue growth demonstrates its strong position in the tech industry​​​​​​​​.\n\nNvidia’s success and growth offer valuable insights and opportunities for startups. As Nvidia demonstrates, focusing on cutting-edge technologies and strategic collaborations can drive significant growth and market leadership. For startups, particularly those in tech industries, Nvidia’s approach highlights the importance of innovation, adaptability and strategic partnerships.\n\nInvesting in startups offers the potential for significant financial returns, especially in high-growth sectors like technology and AI, akin to Nvidia’s success in these fields.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nAverage retirement income in America has been revealed – Will you make enough each month?

        "title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Is Using Debt Safely",
        "content": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Much Debt Does NVIDIA Carry?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in October 2023, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$18.3b in cash, so it actually has US$8.58b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Strong Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?\n\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$9.10b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.8b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$18.3b in cash and US$8.31b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$5.71b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.47t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nStory continues\n\nEven more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 182% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 81% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case NVIDIA has US$8.58b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$18b, being 81% of its EBIT. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nIf you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this freelist of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Palantir’s Potential: A High-Risk, High-Reward Play on the AI Boom",
        "content": "Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) stock was called the “best pure-play AI name” by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.\n\nIf you didn’t own PLTR stock last year, you missed out on a 167% gain by the big data firm. Now its shares aren’t soaring this year like Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA), rising only 3% over the first three weeks. Does that mean Planatir’s run-up is over or is there more room to run? Let’s dive in and see if you missed out or just missed the initial phase of a rocket ride higher.\n\nA Two-Pronged Approach\n\nPalantir Technologies has strong competitive advantages over the competition in the government sector. That’s where it got its start crunching the numbers for the spooks at America’s spy agencies, including the CIA, NSA, the FBI, and the military.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt has long-term contracts with those agencies who use its software to combat terrorism, cybersecurity, and intelligence threats. The government represents 55% of Palantir’s revenue.\n\nYet Palantir recognized the real growth market was in the commercial segment. Its Foundry platform helps businesses with data integration, analysis, and decision-making.\n\nIt boasts a diverse cross-section of enterprise clients with corporations such as BP (NYSE:BP), Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), and 3M (NYSE:MMM). It now has 181 enterprise customers with segment revenue rising 23% in its fiscal third quarter.\n\nIts new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) allows them to combine their data with logic to take action. AIP userstripled over the last three months and since it launched the platform six months ago the number of organizations using AIP stands at almost 300.\n\nPalantir has now been profitable for four consecutive quarters on a GAAP basis on the increased demand for data and AI solutions. That’s not going to stop as AIP will also see the number of clients using it grow exponentially. Wider profits and margins will follow in their wake.\n\nWhat’s Next for PLTR Stock?\n\nOf course, Palantir Technologies has a few risks and challenges to face. Revenue growth has decelerated over the past few years, though no one expected it to maintain the torrid pace it was on.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt also has to be mindful of the vagaries of relying upon government contracts. It’s why it was smart to expand into and widen its usefulness to the private sector.\n\nAlthough there is still enormous excitement about the potential for AI, there remains hesitancy too. We’re still in the top of the first inning with AI and it is too early to accurately forecast where it will go in the future.\n\nFor example, there is the potential tumult it creates in the labor market as people lose their jobs to AI. Will companies lose any AI-generated savings to worker retraining? Will the purported benefits AI delivers actually materialize? Companies are seeing some results now but they still need it to flow to the bottom line.\n\nLast, PLTR stock is not cheap. It trades at over 200 times earnings, though that’s not uncommon with newly profitable stocks. Yet it also goes for 18 times sales, which puts it amongst the loftiest in its industry.\n\nBecause Palantir is only just turning profitable, its business has plenty of time to grow into its valuation. There may be some hiccups in AI’s usefulness but they won’t materialize just yet. PLTR stock is definitely sitting in the nosebleed seats but it is worth the price of admission for the long-term potential it holds.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM stock.

Those calls sounded familiar, because we’ve been hearing them for at least the past year.\n\nBut the broadening hasn’t really materialized. And now the major averages are hovering at record highs.\n\nMaybe it’s time to put to bed the notion that the rally “needs” to broaden to be sustained.\n\nInfo tech and communications services are the two best-performing groups thus far this year. Utilities and energy and consumer discretionary are in the red, among other sectors.\n\nThe Seven (or really, Magnificent Six, since Tesla has slumped) has powered forward. Nvidia is still the standout, with a 20% jump this year on top of its nearly 240% rally last year.\n\nThat means that once again — but even more so — big-cap tech is responsible for the push to new records. The Magnificent Six have accounted for a whopping 89% of the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) year-to-date return through Monday’s close, according to Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre.\n\nBig Tech hasn’t reported earnings yet, so the stocks could take a hit when their numbers and forecasts come out. Both info tech and communications services are predicted to report year-over-year growth in both earnings and revenue, according to FactSet. It’s certainly possible that they won’t be able to meet the lofty expectations implied by the stocks’ run this year.\n\nBut that was frequently the narrative around tech earnings last year as well. As the refrain went, how could they possibly continue to gain, given what was being priced in?\n\nAnd then Meta leaped 194%. Tesla doubled. Amazon soared 80%. Microsoft rallied 57%. Alphabet rose 58%. Apple gained 48%. And Nvidia, as previously mentioned, more than tripled. For some investors, surprise at these numbers amounted to an utter failure of imagination.\n\nStory continues\n\nNone of this is to say the same thing will continue to happen.

That should help lift valuations for a broad swath of the U.S. equity market, but the stocks to sell out there are ready to burst.\n\nWith investors enjoying the prospect of cheap money again, irrational valuations are springing up to start 2024. These seven stocks to sell may seem like hot trading ideas today, but they will plummet when the current rally winds down.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA) automobile dealership vending machine.

Through its online marketing, car vending machines, and aggressive used car purchasing programs, Carvana has tried to disrupt the user car industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis is certainly a field ripe for change; many used car dealers have an unscrupulous reputation, and a savvy tech platform could improve the user experience. However, it also has to be profitable.\n\nSo far, Carvana has been profoundly unsuccessful at the profitability problem. It has lost money every year dating back to 2014, and the losses have expanded over time. Carvana lost a stunning $1.6 billion in 2022 alone, but that’s not the only thing that makes this one of the stocks to sell now.\n\nA few years ago, investors were willing to fund money-losing businesses seeming indefinitely. However, that patience has run out.\n\nThis week, rival Vroom (NYSE:VRM) announced that it is discontinuing its ecommerce operations and closing its used vehicle dealerships in the wake of large and unsustainable losses. Given Carvana’s heavy debt load and jaw-dropping operating losses, it seems like a matter of time until it follows Vroom’s lead.\n\nUranium Energy Corp.

(NYSE:UEC) is a uranium mining firm with operations in the United States, Canada, and Paraguay.\n\nNuclear stocks are popular again, and with good reason as the industry has staged a strong recovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut not all uranium stocks are created equal. UEC stock has surged 97% over the past 12 months, pushing its market cap up to a chunky $3.0 billion. That’s a huge number for a company that had a grand total of $108,000 of revenues last quarter.\n\nUranium Energy has a lot of uranium deposits that could one day be profitable mines. However, at this market cap, investors are putting a lot of faith in unproven assets.\n\nEven with uranium prices at sky-high levels right now, analysts expect the company to lose money in 2024. If uranium prices slide again, you’ll see why this is one of the stocks to sell before they pop.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

That may or may not be the case. But at least Nvidia is generating massive revenue growth and large profits.\n\nWhat if you had the same AI hype but not much in the way of actual revenue or profit growth? You’d be describing Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices saw its profits collapse in 2022 as the computing market slowed down after its pandemic-era boom. Recent results haven’t been much better. Last quarter, both revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share grew just 4%, which is hardly the sort of figures you’d expect given the vast amounts of AI hype.\n\nAMD stock has more than doubled over the past year, even as the underlying business has hardly any traction at all. Shares are selling at more than 60 times forward non-GAAP earnings and a stunning 88 times EV/EBITDA.\n\nNvidia has proven to be a real winner from the AI wave; however, other firms like AMD have seen their share prices skyrocket without any similar rise in their underlying financial results. That would make AMD one of the semiconductor stocks to sell soon.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is another semiconductor company that is up dramatically on AI excitement despite little sign of it benefitting their actual business.\n\nBarclays, for example, tagged Marvell as a potential winner from the so-called second wave of AI. Marvell’s team has talked about AI a lot and people are tagging it as a beneficiary.\n\nHowever, there’s not a great deal of evidence that Marvell’s system-on-a-chip solutions are going to be in the center of the AI revolution.\n\nIn fact, despite all the AI chatter, Marvell’s actual fiscal year 2024 revenues are set to fall about 7%, with analysts seeing a modest 11% revenue growth rate in fiscal year 2025. Unless Marvell’s revenue growth rate dramatically improves, it’s hard to see why this firm should be worth a lofty 46 times forward earnings.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM) Affirm (AFRM) logo displayed on a smartphone.

BNPL has existed in many overseas markets for decades but is less common in America.\n\nIn theory, Affirm and other BNPL players could have built a nice niche business. However, Affirm has struggled with execution.\n\nThe company generated a modest operating loss of $75 million in 2020. But as the company has tried to grow, its operating losses have mushroomed. The company lost $331 million in 2021, $796 million in 2022, and ran a jaw-dropping $982 million operating loss in 2023.\n\nMaking matters worse, Affirm has engaged in wildly unprofitable lending during a boom for the consumer lending industry. Other firms, such as credit card companies, were enjoying strong results over the past few years.\n\nNow, however, conditions are turning sharply more negative with write-offs and delinquencies rising in the consumer credit industry. Affirm generated massive losses during a boom for the industry, now that a bust is setting in, things will go from bad to worse for this struggling FinTech.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nMall retailers have had their difficulties over the past decade.

With a stunning 260% rally over the past year, ANF stock has reached new all-time highs surpassing the prior peak from back in 2007.\n\nGive the company a ton of credit; it has reinvented its brands and generated real consumer enthusiasm again. I have a lot of respect for the job management has done in turning the company around.\n\nThat said, apparel is a tough business, and that’s doubly true with the competition from online commerce. The company will have to keep getting everything right to support its record-high stock price.\n\nAny strategic missteps or overall slowdown in consumer spending will likely cause ANF shares to give back a big chunk of their recent surge.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) a robot built in the essence of a human raising its hand to its chin implying deep thought. future tech stocks\n\nSource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NYSE:SYM) is a robotics company focused on warehouse logistics and automation.\n\nTraders have gravitated to SYM stock over the past year as shares have nearly tripled.

        "title": "Where Will Super Micro's Soaring Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "With share prices up by 49% in the first three weeks of 2024, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has hit the ground running in the new year. This latest move caps off an almost 500% rally over the last 12 months as investors become increasingly optimistic about its potential in generative artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\n\nLet's discuss what the next three years could have in store for the company.\n\nWhat does the guidance upgrade mean for investors?\n\nOn Jan. 19, Super Micro released its preliminary results for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in December. With expected revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion, it will dramatically exceed both its best-case prediction of $2.9 billion and the analyst consensus of $3.06 billion -- all thanks to one growth engine: AI.\n\nAlthough not as well known as other AI hardware giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Super Micro plays a key role in this fast-growing industry by using graphics processing units (GPUs) and other chips to assemble complete computer servers for websites, data storage, and complex AI applications.\n\nThe company helps turn Nvidia chips into ready-to-use systems for the end user, so it enjoys some spillover effects from its partner's success amid booming AI demand.\n\nWhat could the next three years bring?\n\nSuper Micro depends on Nvidia for a lot of its revenue because it needs the chipmaker to allocate a portion of the GPUs it produces. However, over the next three years, Super Micro's innovations in server design and efficiency could play a growing role in its continued success.\n\nAccording to analysts at Rosenblatt Securities, part of Super Micro's guidance beat could be because of increased demand for its liquid cooling for data centers. Compared to traditional air-cooling methods, liquid cooling is more efficient at removing heat from a system to prevent it from damaging equipment.\n\nSuch features are becoming more important as businesses manage increasingly demanding workloads while running and training AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn years to come, rising demand for liquid cooling could expand the company's total addressable market and reduce its reliance on third-party chip suppliers for growth.\n\nWhat about the valuation?\n\nOver the last two years, Super Micro's revenue and profits have gone parabolic in response to the rising AI chip demand in data centers. And industry experts remain optimistic that the boom can continue. CEO Lisa Su of AMD expects the total market to rise almost tenfold from $45 billion to $400 billion by 2027.

        "title": "Nvidia Dominates the AI Market, but Don't Ignore These 3 Challengers",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 1,420% over the past five years. Its growth was largely driven by the expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which prompted more companies to install its high-end GPUs in their data centers.\n\nNvidia generated 80% of its revenue from its data center chips in its latest quarter, while its gaming business -- its original growth engine prior to the AI boom -- only brought in 16% of its revenue. The bulls believe Nvidia's data center business will continue growing as companies develop more advanced generative AI platforms and large language models, and that its GPUs will remain the industry standard for processing those complicated tasks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's current list of customers supports that bullish view. ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Amazon, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and other tech giants all use its chips to power their AI services. But over the long term, other chipmakers could loosen Nvidia's iron grip on the AI market. Let's take a closer look at the three most likely challengers.\n\n1. Intel\n\nNvidia's GPUs usually work alongside Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) high-end Xeon CPUs in data centers to accelerate machine learning and AI tasks. For Intel, which still controls about 94% of the server CPU market, Nvidia's expansion into the data center market is an unwelcome intrusion which implies its CPUs can't efficiently handle AI tasks on their own.\n\nCPUs still process one piece of data at a time, while GPUs process a large array of integers and floating point numbers simultaneously -- which makes them better suited for graphics and AI applications. To close that gap, Intel launched its own line of Xe GPUs in September 2020, and its Xe-HP (High Performance) and Xe-HPC (High Performance Compute) directly target Nvidia's data center GPUs. It followed that up with the rollout of its new \"Max\" data center GPUs last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an unusual departure from its first-party foundry model, Intel outsources the production of its GPUs to its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- which also manufactures Nvidia's high-end GPUs. Those chips haven't gained much momentum yet, but Intel's ongoing expansion of that business -- and its ability to bundle its GPUs with its Xeon CPUs -- might eventually hurt Nvidia.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nNvidia's expansion into the data center market gave it an edge against Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which controls a much smaller slice of the discrete GPU market. However, AMD has been fighting back with its new Instinct data center chips for AI tasks.\n\nIt launched its first three Instinct GPUs (the MI6, MI8, and MI25) in 2017, which were followed by additional 7-nanometer and 6nm MI chips over the following four years. It launched its latest MI300 Instinct chips, which were built on TSMC's 5nm and 6nm nodes, last December. In the latest benchmarks, AMD's top-tier MI300X beats Nvidia's H100 in terms of processing power and memory bandwidth, but Nvidia claims the H100 still outperforms the MI300X when it's running on optimized software.\n\nAMD's AI ambitions could cause problems for Nvidia, especially if it continues its tradition of selling its chips at lower prices. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are already testing or running Instinct GPUs -- and that customer list could grow longer as cost-conscious data center operators shop around for the best deals.\n\n3. Internally developed chips\n\nLast but not least, Nvidia's dominance of the data center GPU market is driving many of its top customers -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta -- to develop their own AI accelerator chips. It could take years for those projects to bear fruit, but the development of those chips raises red flags for Nvidia's long-term growth.\n\nLast year, Google published a research paper that suggested its own fourth-generation TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) were faster and more efficient than Nvidia's A100 chips. Meta also recently poached an entire research team from Graphcore, the AI start-up that claims its \"graph processing\" method can process AI tasks more efficiently than Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThese tech giants are still buying a lot of Nvidia's A100 GPUs to process their AI tasks, but they could gradually replace those chips with their first-party silicon to cut costs. If that happens, Nvidia's biggest growth engine could sputter out.\n\nInvestors shouldn't assume Nvidia is invincible\n\nNvidia's future looks bright, but investors should expect it to face some unpredictable challenges over the next few years. Intel, AMD, and first-party chips won't throttle its growth anytime soon, but they could eventually evolve into major threats. Simply put, investors shouldn't assume Nvidia is an invincible leader of the AI market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 24, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, A. O. Smith Corp. AOS and Arista Networks, Inc. ANET.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Solid S&P 500 Stocks to Bet On as Index Hits All-Time High\n\nWall Street showed volatility to start the New Year. However, stocks have since then rebounded and three major indexes officially entered the bull market last week, with the S&P 500 Index hitting an all-time high. The S&P 500 closed at 4,839.81 points on Friday to record its highest close since January 2022.\n\nWall Street had a solid 2023 after a disappointing 2022 as 40-year-high inflation took a toll on stocks and the Federal Reserve implemented an aggressive interest rate hike policy to normalize the situation. This saw the S&P 500 giving up 19% in 2022.\n\nThe high interest rate regime continued in 2023 but markets rebounded as inflation started showing signs of easing. The Fed left interest rates unchanged for the first time in July last year before keeping it steady in its last three FOMC meetings after hiking rates by 525 basis points.\n\nSlowing inflation and a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve sent stocks on a year-end rally that saw the S&P 500 recording a 24% gain in 2023 as fears of a recession waned.\n\nS&P to Rally in 2024\n\nEconomists now expect that the economy will make a softer landing as inflation has eased considerably. The Federal Reserve has also hinted at cutting interest rates this year. Although the optimism among investors about the first interest rate cut coming in March has somewhat wanted, rate cuts are happening for sure in 2024.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, 47.2% feel that a 25-basis point rate cut is possible in March. This was, however, more than 90% at the beginning of this year. Several Fed officials have indicated at least three 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates bode well for stock markets. A low risk-free interest rate will bring down the discount rate, leading to an increase in the net present value of investments in equities.\n\nAlso, the economy is on solid ground. The third-quarter GDP grew 4.9% and according to the Atlanta Fed, the nation’s GDP is projected to grow 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in four S&P 500 stocks such as American Water Works Company, Inc., NVIDIA Corp., A. O. Smith Corp. and Arista Networks, Inc. that have a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns.

        "title": "Forget Microsoft in 2024: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) skyrocketed after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022. The chatbot highlighted how far AI has come, with the potential to advance countless industries, including cloud computing, e-commerce, consumer products, healthcare, education, autonomous driving, and more.\n\nIn fact, according to data from Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. The market's trajectory would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the decade's end. As a result, it's not surprising that numerous AI stocks have soared over the last year.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) shares have climbed 69% since last January, rallying Wall Street with its 49% stake in OpenAI. The partnership has granted Microsoft access to some of the industry's most advanced AI models, suggesting the Windows company has significant potential in the sector.\n\nHowever, AI is expanding quickly, presenting dozens of other attractive ways to invest in the industry. Some of these options could have more growth potential than Microsoft, or offer more value.\n\nSo forget Microsoft in 2024. Here are two AI stocks to buy instead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're probably aware of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) meteoric rise last year. Its stock soared 239% in 2023 as the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for AI developers worldwide.\n\nAs interest in AI soared, so did demand for GPUs, and Nvidia was perfectly positioned to supply its hardware to the entire market. The company achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI chips alongside soaring earnings.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended October 2023), Nvidia's revenue rose 206% year over year as operating income increased 1,600%. The company profited from a spike in AI GPU sales, represented by a 279% rise in data center revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has a powerful position in AI. Competition in the software side of the industry is heating up, with companies like Microsoft and Amazon facing off over leadership in AI cloud services. However, increased competition only means more chip customers for Nvidia, with the company likely to flourish for years. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows that over the next two fiscal years, Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share, while Microsoft's may achieve about $15 per share. Multiplying these figures by each company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (Nvidia's 48 and Microsoft's 35) yields stock prices of $1,152 for Nvidia and $525 for Microsoft.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 96% and Microsoft's 33% over the next two fiscal years. While both figures are impressive, Nvidia's higher percentage and prominent role in AI make it a more attractive investment this year.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has massive potential in AI.\n\nThe company has grown into a tech behemoth, hosting nine products with more than 1 billion users. Its top performers are Google Search, Android, and Chrome. While these services enabled Alphabet to build a lucrative digital advertising business, they could also prove to be assets in its AI expansion.\n\nLast December Alphabet unveiled Gemini, a highly anticipated AI model that is expected to be competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4. The popularity of Alphabet's various services and Gemini could prove to be a powerful combination. With the new model, Alphabet could create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, offer more effective advertising, introduce new AI tools on Google Cloud, and better track viewing trends on YouTube.\n\nAlphabet surpassed $77 billion in free cash flow last year, significantly more than rivals Microsoft or Amazon. The company's considerable cash reserves strengthen its outlook in AI, as it has the funds to invest heavily in its research and development and overcome potential hurdles. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThese charts show Alphabet's stock is also far cheaper than Microsoft's. The company has lower figures in two key valuation metrics: forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, forward P/S divides its market cap by estimated revenue. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nForward P/E and P/S are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares, as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In this case, Alphabet is a far bigger bargain than Microsoft on both fronts. Alongside considerable potential in AI, Alphabet is a no-brainer buy in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 24, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, NVIDIA NVDA, Salesforce CRM, and Amazon.com AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 S&P 500 Growth Stocks to Buy as Index Enjoys Bull Market\n\nThe S&P 500 bounced back in 2023 after taking a beating in the prior year, gaining an encouraging 24% as steady economic growth squashed any expectations of an impending recession, while price pressures came down to levels that compelled the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 was off to a rough start in 2024 as market participants took some profits in tech bigwigs such as Apple Inc. But they recently returned to buy back those magnificent tech players, helping the S&P 500 enter a bull market. The broader index has soared more than 35% from its October 2022 low.\n\nFor the first time, the S&P 500 finished at a record close, in more than two years. The index has also set an intraday record high after gyrating in a tight trading range for nearly a month. The large-cap benchmark closed at 4,839.81 on Jan 19 and exceeded the previous record close of 4,796.56 achieved on Jan 3, 2022. Additionally, the index hit an intraday high of 4,842.07, easily topping the intraday record of 4,818.62 attained on Jan 4, 2022, per FactSet data.\n\nNow, bull markets generally tend to last for quite some time. The previous bull market that started in March 2020 continued for less than two years. What’s more, the bull market that began before that prevailed for almost 10 years. It began from the Great Recession period till the outbreak of the coronavirus in February 2020. Similarly, the current bull market is expected to continue as stocks gain momentum, banking on a less hawkish Fed, upbeat consumer sentiment, and uptick in tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs inflation has started to show signs of cooling down, the Fed has kept its interest rates unchanged in the last meeting and is widely expected to trim rates this year. Interest rate cuts are always a boon for the stock market as they boost consumer outlays, decrease the cost of borrowings, and pep up the economy (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates in 2024).\n\nAmericans are anyhow feeling much more optimistic about the current and future business scenarios, thanks to the strength in the labor market. The University of Michigan stated that its consumer sentiment index surged 21.4% year over year in January and touched its highest level since July 2021. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index, too, had touched the highest level in December since July (read more: Raise a Toast to These 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks in 2024).\n\nTech stocks, meanwhile, are gaining traction due to AI optimism. Taiwan Semiconductor’s latest upbeat earnings report also bolstered confidence for the chip sector. Gains in mega-cap tech stocks eventually erased the S&P 500’s 2024 losses. Hence, with the S&P 500 scaling upward, it's prudent for astute investors to place bets on growth stocks listed in the index.\n\nSome of the prominent names are NVIDIA, Salesforce, and Amazon.com. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "title": "Nvidia CEO's low-key China visit seen as a goodwill gesture towards key market as US chip firm grapples with sanction issues",
        "content": "Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang's first trip to mainland China in four years has been a goodwill gesture to the chip designer's staff and clients in the country, which remains a key market despite tough US restrictions, analysts say.\n\nWhile Nvidia did not release details of Huang's itinerary, a person familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified, said the firm invited several key distributors to its Beijing office for a get-together attended by Huang. A second person, who also requested anonymity, said Huang did not have any private meetings with Chinese officials.\n\n\"Following four years of disruption from the pandemic, Jensen is resuming his annual tradition of celebrating the Chinese New Year with our local employees,\" said an Nvidia spokesperson, without elaborating.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nXinbang, a Chinese online media outlet that covers the semiconductor industry, reported that Huang visited Nvidia's Beijing office on January 15, Shanghai on January 17 and Shenzhen on January 19, to attend annual meetings with local employees.\n\nThere have been no media reports of Huang meeting with Chinese clients or government officials during the trip, in contrast with recent visits by other high-profile US executives, such as Tesla founder Elon Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nVideo clips of Huang meeting Chinese staff went viral on the mainland's internet in recent days. In one clip, Huang, 60, was dressed in a red-and-green flowered vest, dancing on stage with other performers.\n\nIn another video, Huang drew a lucky number from a lottery box and called out the winner's name as \"Hua Wei\", which sounds similar to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies, currently under tough US trade sanctions.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang's visit comes as Nvidia is caught between US-China geopolitical hostilities. On the one hand, the mainland remains the most important market in Asia for Nvidia, contributing 20 to 25 per cent of revenue in the past several quarters.\n\nOn the other hand, the US government tightened chip export restrictions to China last October, blocking the mainland's access to graphics processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia had specifically designed for Chinese clients in response to earlier curbs.\n\nYuyuantantian, a Chinese social media account run by state television, said in an opinion piece on Tuesday that Huang's visit \"reflected his concern about the possibility of losing the China market\".\n\n\"China's artificial intelligence (AI) sector is growing rapidly and is leading the world along with the US ... Nvidia knows what's at stake. Loss of the China market and Chinese customer data would mean a double hit for Nvidia,\" it added.\n\nAnalysts said Huang will have a tough job in the short-run to shore up business amid widening tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\n\"Huang is trying to make a goodwill gesture to the important China market, although he doesn't want to draw too much attention amid the current political environment,\" said Arisa Liu, a semiconductor research director at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.\n\nSu Lian Jye, a chief analyst with research company Omdia, said while Huang's trip was a friendly gesture, it is unlikely to solve Nvidia problems in the Chinese market.\n\nAs China pushes ahead with its AI development, Nvidia GPUs have seen high levels of demand from cloud services clients such as Baidu, Tencent Holdings, Alibaba Group Holding and ByteDance. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nHowever, under an October update to US trade sanctions, Nvidia cannot ship its leading A800 and H800 chips to China-based customers. As such, the US chip giant has developed three new data centre GPUs - the H20, L20 and L2. Nevertheless, US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has warned that Washington will take a dim view of any workaround solutions targeted at the mainland.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Blue-chip healthcare stocks tend to be among the top portfolio picks for long-term investors today. Though their blue-chip status implies maturity, which they have, it also implies that the companies have limited growth prospects. That’s far from the case for the best blue-chip healthcare stocks today.\n\nHealthcare and MedTech are emerging, changing and innovative stock sectors. Healthcare advancements march unabated even as cash and regulatory limitations cut down on acceleration in other domains like artificial intelligence (AI). Instead, healthcare innovation proceeds rapidly as it races to catch up to an aging population with ever-longer lifespans.\n\nThat’s why finding the best blue-chip healthcare stocks is a matter of picking those with market legitimacy, a proven product and long-term growth outlooks. While you could generate greater returns through riskier plays in biotech or other emergent MedTech sectors, these blue-chip healthcare stocks help balance the equation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), a leading healthcare industry player, capitalizes on the growing trend of using robotics in surgical procedures. Standing out from other small-cap healthcare stocks, ISRG has established itself as a reliable company, listed on both the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500, which cements its market position.\n\nAnalysts overwhelmingly favor the stock despite its relative overvaluation. Of 23 analysts, 18 rate it a buy, showing strong confidence in its potential despite a high price. Interestingly, no analyst recommends selling the stock, and the remaining five advise holding it.\n\nThe most recent quarter showcases encouraging trends for ISRG, signaling strong growth prospects. Procedures using ISRG’s surgical robotics platform have risen by 19%, showing a 17% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2019. Revenue and income have also seen significant growth, with increases of 12% and 29%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those seeking top blue-chip healthcare stocks to buy and hold, anchoring a portfolio with a reliable yet innovative firm like ISRG represents a healthy investment strategy.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) offers the best mix of stability and growth opportunities, in my opinion. Healthcare investing can be tricky when it comes to pharma, biotech, and the like. However, medical device companies tend to be more easily understood by retail investors and, in turn, tend to be the most representative among blue-chip healthcare stocks. Medtronic, a standout blue-chip healthcare stock and member of the dividend aristocrats, is well-positioned for healthcare’s future.\n\nThis sentiment becomes clear with Medtronic’s collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop an AI-powered diagnostic platform. But that’s just the beginning. Earlier this month, CEO Geoff Martha told conference attendees that Medtronic uses AI for clinical decision support, creates new indications, and delivers personalized treatments, positioning it uniquely to advance AI in MedTech.\n\nMedtronic’s total yield currently stands at 3.39%, mostly from dividends—a hallmark of blue-chip healthcare stocks. The company, gearing up for a late February earnings report, is positioned to exceed analyst expectations if the last filing is any indication.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) consistently achieves victories as a biotech stock, making it unique as it is also inarguably among the top blue-chip healthcare stocks. Over the past five years, the company’s stock has maintained a solid trajectory, even in economic turmoil, boasting an impressively low beta of just 0.16, a notable feat for any stock, let alone a biotech firm.\n\nA recent triumph for Regeneron came with the FDA’s August 2023 approval of a high-dosage variant of its eye disease therapeutic, Eylea. This high-dose treatment enhances Regeneron’s competitive edge and positions the product effectively against Medicare price negotiations that impact REGN’s profits.\n\nHowever, Regeneron’s future prospects extend beyond Eylea. The company’s flagship drug, Dupixent, primarily treats asthma and eczema, but it’s also making headway in Phase 3 trials for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Initial results show a 34% symptom reduction with Dupixent. As a top seller, analysts anticipate Dupixent’s successful application for COPD could spike sales to $20 billion annually.\n\nA broader view of Regeneron’s pipeline reveals its focus on key sectors that draw investors to biotech, including monoclonal antibody therapeutics, gene therapy and gene editing platforms—the pinnacle of biotech investment opportunities.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Nvidia (NVDA) standing at $598.73, reflecting a +0.37% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.29%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.25%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.43%.\n\nShares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence witnessed a gain of 22.17% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 3.67% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.49, up 410.23% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $20.1 billion, indicating a 232.16% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $12.31 per share and a revenue of $58.92 billion, indicating changes of +268.56% and +118.42%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the13 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors are still deeply divided over what the future might look like for the stock market in the weeks and months to come. While the bulls believe a soft landing is in sight, doubts remain over the Federal Reserve's possible plan of action regarding rate cuts as inflation remains sticky. A latest Wall Street Journal report cited CME FedWatch tool data which says there is now a 50% chance the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged during its March meeting. When 2024 was about to start this figure stood at just 3.85%. The optimism seen in the last quarter of 2023 was overwhelming and proved to be fickle. The WSJ report also said, citing swap contracts tied to the consumer-price index, that traders now see inflation at 2.4% over the next five years, the highest level since November. This shows we might be in for a long period of elevated inflation and high interest rates. In this environment, would mega-cap tech stocks like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which posted euphoric gains in 2023 be able to keep going higher? Only time would tell. For now let's take a look at the stocks that are trending these days. Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nAmid earnings, the beginning of the election buzz and upcoming economic data, it's interesting to see which stocks are currently trending in terms of high volume. For this article we used Yahoo Finance' stock screener which looks for mid-, small- and large-cap stocks with high trading volume and movement. From these stock we selected stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.  Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nStory continues\n\n13. Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nCrypto mining and digital assets company Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) has gained about 80% in value over the past one year amid a rebound in bitcoin.\n\nIn December, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) achieved record bitcoin production as Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) produced 1,853 BTC in the month, which was up 56% from November 2023. It was also a 290% YoY increase.\n\nOut of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 13 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA).\n\n12. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nLucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of the most shorted stocks in the EV space amid fears regarding production and uncertainty in 2024 due to upcoming elections. Earlier this month, the stock fell to an all-time low after Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) said it produced 2,391 vehicles during the last quarter of 2023 and delivered 1,734 vehicles, better than the analyst estimates for 1,696 vehicles delivered.\n\n11. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nAs US presidential elections 2024 inch closer, investors are starting to closely watch EV companies as a new government in the US could make or break EV stocks amid new policies. Analysts believe if Republicans come into power and make policies unfriendly to US EV companies, it would bode well for Chinese EV companies like Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) which would also plan faster expansion in other markets.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) during this period was Jos Shaver's Electron Capital Partners which owns a $38 million stake in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO).\n\n10. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nBrazilian mining giant Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) ranks 10th in our list of the top buzzing stocks to buy now. The stock is moving after Bloomberg reported that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants his former finance minister to be the next CEO of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\nIn December, Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) disclosed that its iron ore production of 310M-320M metric tons in 2024 will be flat when compared to  2023.\n\nA total of 34 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE). The biggest stakeholder of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) during this period was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $243 million stake in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\nMiller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world’s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any “unreasonable” price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year’s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company’s market cap.”\n\n9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) ranks ninth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Earlier this month Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) posted domestic Q4 sales volumes, with record electric vehicle (EV) numbers. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) sold 25,937 EVs in the period, a growth of 24% on a YoY basis.\n\n8. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 52\n\nAT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is buzzing as investors get ready to see the company's fourth quarter earnings report. Earlier in the month Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $21 price target.\n\nOppenheimer's analysts see several tailwinds for the stock, including AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 120MHz C-Band portfolio which now covers over 200M point of presence, or POPs. Oppenheimer said that about 60% of AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) subscribers are now fiber, which means healthier margins and pricing leverage.\n\nIn addition to AT&T, other stocks trending right now include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). AT&T is one of the most buzzing stocks to buy right now popular among hedge funds.\n\nMiller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.\n\nAT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”\n\n7. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is creating a buzz as investors get ready to receive Intel Corp's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings report slated to be released on January 25. Recently, a Gartner report said Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) ranked first in the list of top semiconductor companies in 2023, with a  total semiconductor revenue of $48.7 billion.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The most significant stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is owned by William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns a $468 million stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel ranks fifth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\n6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are creating a buzz on the Wall Street as investors await Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings that are set to be announced on January 24. The stock also came in the limelight after Elon Musk expressed his desire to have about 25% voting control over Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in order to make Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) a leader in AI and robotics. Tesla ranks sixth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Like Tesla, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also trending.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have gained about 47% over the past one year. Some analysts expect Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings to come in weaker than expected amid pricing wars in the EV sector.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nTsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable 11 Stocks Insiders and Billionaires Are Crazy About\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Nowis originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In stock investments, seasoned investors often seek high diamonds in rough — undervalued stocks with the potential for astronomical returns. A millionaire’s calculated bet can be reflected in these seven stocks, each representing a unique sector and promising significant growth.\n\nLeading the pack is the first stock, flaunting remarkable top-line growth and an impressive track record of closing high-value deals. Meanwhile, navigating the digital advertising realm, the second one outpaces industry expectations with an 81% revenue surge. The third one’s prowess in the tech industry sees it surpassing revenue projections and strategically monetizing its expanding user base.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth stock on the list takes center stage in growth capital, boasting a resilient portfolio and positioning itself for the next wave of expansion. Notably, the fifth one’s robust liquidity and balanced leverage approach make waves in the shipping industry, ensuring stability and sustainable growth. Interestingly, the sixth has diversified revenue streams, and operational excellence showcases its resilience. Finally, the seventh’s focus on AI and GPU solutions propels it to the forefront of technological advancements.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe article explores the potential of these millionaire-approved stocks and their pathways to a possible 10-fold return.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo seen on billboard, known as Palantir is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir’s (NYSE:PLTR) growth in the U.S. commercial space is critical to its overall progress, as evidenced by its 33% year-over-year growth in Q3 2023. Palantir’s capability to attain growth suggests robust demand for its solutions within the U.S. market. This growth outpaces general industry trends and positions Palantir as a leader in providing analytics solutions to commercial entities.\n\nBesides strategic commercial contracts, the U.S. commercial business grew by 52% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The growth is organic growth caused by customer demand within the commercial segment. Also, the U.S. commercial business is marking a 55% year-over-year increase on a dollar-weighted duration basis. This substantial revenue growth aligns with the number and scale of deals closed by Palantir in the U.S. commercial segment. The company closed 80 deals of $1 million or more, 29 deals of $5 million or more, and 12 deals of $10 million or more in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Palantir’s achievement of a ten-fold increase in U.S. commercial customer count over the last three years is a fundamental milestone. In this direction, a 12% quarter-over-quarter increase in customer count highlights the sustained growth trajectory.\n\nPerion (PERI) peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerion’s (NASDAQ:PERI) retail media solutions have experienced tremendous progress. For instance, in Q3 2023, revenue increased 81% year-over-year. This success is attributed to new customer acquisition and deepening relationships with existing customers, leveraging technologies such as WAVE. Hence, the increased revenue surpasses the expected US retail media growth of less than 20% in 2023.\n\nFundamentally, Perion is not merely riding the wave of market growth but actively steering it. The ability to exceed industry growth expectations suggests that the company’s retail media solutions are competitive and highly sought after by advertisers. Also, the lead in retail media is not solely attributed to financial gains. This signifies Perion’s proficiency in understanding the nuances of consumer behavior and preferences. Therefore, this allows the company to create tailored solutions that resonate with advertisers and drive meaningful results.\n\nLastly, Perion’s retail media success is based on its customer-centric approach, edgy solutions and ability to outperform market expectations. This is positioning the company as a leader in this lucrative segment of digital advertising.\n\nOpera (OPRA) A phone displaying the Opera (OPRA) app\n\nSource: bangoland / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the tech industry, Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) has demonstrated a fundamental capability to generate substantial revenue, outperforming guidance. For instance, the reported revenue of $102.6 million in Q3 2023 surpassed the projected $98-$100 million range. Also, it marked a vital step by exceeding $100 million in quarterly revenue.\n\nIn the same context, Opera’s 20% top-line growth in Q3 further solidifies a progressive trajectory for future revenue streams. Also, Opera’s leads are not solely measured by financial metrics. The growth of its user base and the average revenue per user (ARPU) are indicators of the company’s market reach and monetization strategies. In Q3 2023, Opera reported a considerable boost in its Western user base. Hence, this contributed to an 11% sequential growth in ARPU and a 24% year-over-year increase, reaching $1.31.\n\nOverall, the increase in ARPU demonstrates Opera’s ability to monetize its user base effectively. Also, it implies that Opera is growing its user base by extracting more value from each user. Therefore through targeted advertising, premium services, and other monetization channels.\n\nTPG (TPG) a stock image of a bag of money on a triple beam scale, perfectly balanced with blocks labeled with asset classes such as \"REITs\" and \"ETFs\"\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTPG’s (NASDAQ:TPG) growth capital business has maintained a robust and healthy portfolio, evidenced by the nearly $9 billion of unrealized value across funds. This portfolio resilience is particularly vital in a backdrop of higher interest rates.\n\nMoreover, the mid-teen revenue growth observed in the growth portfolio (Q3 2023) signifies the underlying companies’ capacity to generate substantial top-line expansion. This growth represents TPG’s strategic selection of companies with solid market positions, innovative products or services, and effective execution strategies.\n\nFurthermore, the first close process for the sixth growth fund is accelerating, highlighting TPG’s confidence in the availability of compelling investment opportunities. As the existing supercycle of flagship funds nears its end, TPG is strategically positioning itself for the next wave of growth.\n\nThus, these moves suggest a positive perspective on deal flow and market conditions as well as the potential for value creation in the growth equity space.\n\nFrontline (FRO) Plenty of shipping containers stacked at the Port of Hamburg and blue sky\n\nSource: Hieronymus Ukkel / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrontline’s (NYSE:FRO) liquidity, which stands at $715 million in cash as of Q3 2023, is a significant strength. This liquidity includes the undrawn senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the minimum cash requirements (for the bank) as of Q3 2023.\n\nIn industries with significant capital requirements, like shipping, having substantial cash on hand allows the company to counter economic adversities and capitalize on strategic opportunities. Additionally, the leverage ratio of 52% further supports the company’s growth stability. This ratio indicates the proportion of debt in the company’s capital structure.\n\nFinally, the acquisition of 24 VLCCs may be financed through a bank facility, cash proceeds from the sale of Euronav shares, in-house cash, a senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and funds from shareholders of Hemen. Hence, this balanced leverage take is beneficial for Frontline to minimize financial risk and ensure sustainable value growth.\n\nCelestica (CLS) image of supply chain.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAt the top line, the breakdown of revenue by segment reveals the diversity and strength of Celestica’s (NYSE:CLS) business portfolio. The Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) segment contributed 42% of total revenues (Q3 2023). Meanwhile, the Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) segment contributed 58%. This revenue mix highlights balanced diversification in the top-line. Thus, this diversification positions Celestica to counter fluctuations in specific markets and capitalize on growth across different segments.\n\nAt the bottom line, Celestica’s attainment of a non-IFRS operating margin of 5.7% marks the 15th consecutive quarter of year-to-year expansion. This highlights the company’s focus on operational excellence. The CCS segment’s margin reaching 6.2%, a 1 percentage point increase year-over-year, is a significant milestone, representing the highest-ever segment margin.\n\nLastly, Celestica’s effective working capital management was reflected in the inventory reduction of $85 million sequentially and $65 million year-over-year. This demonstrates the company’s focus on efficient resource utilization. Therefore, there is positive free cash flow for the 19th consecutive quarter, with $34 million in Q3, demonstrating Celestica’s strong cash-generation capabilities.\n\nSuper Micro (SMCI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe focus on AI-related platforms and GPU solutions as primary growth drivers suggests Super Micro’s (NASDAQ:SMCI) edge on industry trends. In Q1 fiscal 2024, over 50% of total revenues will come from AI, GPUs and rack-scale solutions. The company is positioned at the forefront of the AI and high-performance computing markets. This aligns with the broader industry trend of increasing reliance on AI and GPU technologies for various applications.\n\nFundamentally, Super Micro’s focus on technology leadership is evident in its continuous development and launch of innovative products. The numerical trend of launching new AI-optimized platforms, including NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CG1, CG2, Grace Hopper Superchip, and NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, highlights the company’s commitment to staying ahead in a rapidly evolving industry.\n\nAdditionally, the diverse AI solution portfolio, encompassing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Gaudi 2, PCIe Flex, PVC, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) MI250, MI300X, and MI300A, positions Super Micro for broad adoption in the accelerated compute market. A broad product portfolio caters to diverse customer needs and reduces dependence on specific technologies or suppliers. Overall, Super Micro’s strategic focus on being a first-mover in the market aligns with its strategy of staying at the forefront of tech advancements.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PLTR and INTC.

        "content": "In 2014, China quietly set up a state-led fund to invest in semiconductor manufacturing. The China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (now known as “The Big Fund”) would eventually raise $45 billion and distribute the proceeds into everything from wafer fabrication to chip design.\n\nThe results have been jarring. Late last year, Chinese state-owned Huawei quietly launched the Mate 60 Pro, a 5G phone that stunned analysts. The Western-sanctioned firm had acquired advanced 7-nanometer chips that only ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and its customers were thought to produce. (Some believe that Huawei’s suppliers secretly procured ASML machines).\n\nThis is only the start. In an October briefing, the Pentagon warned lawmakers that China had designated artificial intelligence as one of its top priorities for warfare. And on Jan. 12, a report by the South China Morning Post revealed that Baidu’s (NASDAQ:BIDU) Ernie Bot chatbot was being used to help train the People’s Liberation Army’s AI systems.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAI nationalism is spreading beyond China as well. The United States plans to pour over $50 billion into local chip manufacturing. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have promised $40 billion to AI firms. Paris-based startup Mistral – a firm with neither a product nor customers – have managed to shape French legislation to its benefit.\n\nEssentially, governments know that AI has incredible potential, and everyone is racing to come out ahead.\n\nThat’s why Eric Fry, InvestorPlace’s global macro investing specialist, is hosting the 2024 AI Wars Summit on Tuesday, January 23, at 7 p.m. Eastern. I’ll have more info on that for you later in this report… but you can save your spot now by going here.\n\nIn the meantime, our analysts here at InvestorPlace.com, our free news site, highlight three companies this week that are at the forefront of the coming AI Wars.\n\n4 Stocks to Buy for the Coming AI Wars: Intel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe greatest financial beneficiary of America’s AI largesse will be Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the company that revolutionized central processing units (CPUs). Since its founding in 1968, the firm has gone from making 64-bit memory chips to becoming the world’s largest maker of advanced processors. At its peak in 2016, Intel held an 81% market share in global CPU shipments.\n\nHowever, Intel staked its fortunes on vertical integration. Unlike rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel manufactures the chips it designs. In good times, this helps turbocharge Intel’s bottom line by capturing more of the value chain. But several R&D missteps in 2018-2020 left Intel a full generation of chips behind. It is now struggling to produce 10-nanometer technologies even as rivals churn out 7-nanometer chips.\n\nThe hard truth is that Intel’s gambit of “leapfrogging” to 2-nanometer chips is risky at best. And even if it succeeds, the firm will likely trail Samsung in getting mass production into market.\n\nBut don’t count Intel out just yet. The Silicon Valley company will be the largest recipient of U.S. AI grants, which could pour over $4 billion into local semiconductor manufacturing plants (known as “fabs”). And future chip import restrictions will likely give Intel a leg up over rivals.\n\nIt’s why, in his Smart Money letter, Eric calls Intel the top candidate to become the next trillion-dollar AI company.\n\nSimply put, Intel stands at the ready with a roster of offerings that can help power the AI Revolution.\n\nThe company remains a top dog and, even with some pullbacks, it has been on a growth trajectory recently. In fact, the stock soared nearly 100% in 2023.\n\nThough Intel’s management have a daunting task ahead of them, their firm remains the single-best bet on American chip manufacturing… and, therefore… on the rising tide of AI nationalism.\n\n2. Synopsys (SNPS) AI stocks to Buy, Close-up of letters \"AI\" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks. ai chip stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\n\nMeanwhile, a technical winner of the coming AI Wars will be Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), an Arizona-based firm that specializes in semiconductor design. The company has an unusually small exposure to Chinese demand; only 15% of sales are made there. And the rise of increasingly complex Western-made chips will raise demand for Synopsys’ services.\n\nIn short, Synopsis is the leader in digital electronic design automation (EDA), which helps chipmakers design new semiconductors. Modern chips can hold billions of components, and companies like Synopsys – and its chief competitor, Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) – are needed to create and test these designs.\n\nShares of Synopsys have traditionally traded at a rich premium. The 37-year-old firm earns extremely high returns thanks to it and Cadence’s duopolistic positions; markets are keenly aware of this.\n\nBut a recent acquisition of simulation software maker ANSYS has put investors on edge. Since mid-December, shares of Synopsys have fallen 12% over concerns that the electronic design automation (EDA) firm was overpaying for its latest acquisition.\n\nWe see the selloff as a rare opportunity to buy. Synopsys only paid a 20% premium to market prices for ANSYS, and the path to merging is relatively straightforward because their products are complementary. In a recent update, Samuel O’Brient notes for InvestorPlace.com that Wall Street analysts now forecast upside potential of 25%.\n\n“This automation firm is in an excellent position to keep riding the AI wave to new heights,” O’Brient notes. “Wall Street… currently features nine buy ratings and zero sells.”\n\nInvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango sees even greater upside ahead. The company is a core pick in his “Top 10 Investment Themes for 2024” for its exposure to huge demand tailwinds and increasing amounts of AI chip customization:\n\nWe expect that because they are the building blocks of AI applications – and AI applications will likely become a global ubiquity over the next several years – demand for AI chips will continue to grow for the next decade. However, we also believe that in 2024, demand for AI chips will start to shift away from Nvidia and toward other AI chipmakers thanks to chip shortages, customization needs, and price sensitivities\n\n3. Palantir (PLTR) The Palantir (PLTR) logo on a grey wall.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nA longer-term winner of the AI Wars will be Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), a big-data platform focused on U.S. government applications.\n\nPalantir has historically struggled with corporate sales. According to an analysis by Morningstar, the big-data firm spent $467 million on marketing in 2022, yet still counts only 200 corporate clients.\n\nHowever, Palantir is a behemoth when it comes to government-based work. The firm generates over $1 billion from public-sector contracts annually, and that figure is set to grow to $1.6 billion by 2025.\n\nAt the core of this is Palantir’s proven ability to handle mass amounts of sensitive data. The U.S. military rightly worries about where it sends its confidential information, and Palantir’s intertwined history with the CIA, as detailed by Chris MacDonald at InvestorPlace.com, gives it credentials that no other firm can match.\n\nThe increasing appetite for AI will only increase demand for Palantir’s services. Militaries worldwide are realizing that AI and machine learning (AI/ML) will become essential in modern warfare, and Palantir has already begun seeing the effects of this demand. In its most recent quarter, the Denver-based firm saw deal values double to $116 million and operating margins surge to 29%.\n\nIn a minor twist, the rise of the AI Wars also could trigger interest from corporate America. Many firms have become wary of sending copyrighted data (or any other sensitive information) to tech giants, especially with the rise of generative AI. In January, The New York Times filed a lawsuit against both OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for using the newspaper’s articles without permission.\n\nMeanwhile, firms like Palantir operate as platforms, which mean they provide the data analysis tools, while leaving control of data to their customers. The company’s AI platform is also seeing initial success. That’s why Louis Navellier and his staff recently note that it won’t take much to kick Palantir back into high gear.\n\nPLTR stock bulls can point to the initial success with Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform. This platform has been gaining customers at a rapid clip, with the number of customers recently rising by 50%… As seen in Q3 results, customer growth overall (34%) has been outpacing revenue growth…\n\nWhile not for certain, this may suggest that revenue and earnings growth this year could come in higher than sell-side analyst forecasts… particularly for Palantir’s commercial segment\n\nThough Palantir’s shares trade for a relative premium, a steadily rising tide of AI and big-data demand will eventually help the firm fill in that gap.\n\n4. Tyler Technologies (TYL) Tyler Technologies (TYL) logo on the website homepage.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT/ Shutterstock.com\n\nTyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) is a leader in the under-the-radar niche of government operational software. It has the largest installed base of any firm, with over 40,000 client installations, and manages everything from veterans’ benefits to school enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.\n\nIt’s a highly lucrative business. In 2022, the company generated $164 million in profits, while having to reinvest just $50 million. Growth has also been strong. Since 2018, the Texas-based company has seen its recurring revenue grow 22% annually.\n\nSince 2022, however, shares have fallen 25% on fears of a growth slowdown. State governments were beginning to run out of Covid-19-era stimulus funds, making Tyler dependent on acquisitions to fuel its expansion. Net income growth would slide from 29% in 2021 to just 4% in 2023.\n\nBut renewed concern over cybersecurity threats means market leaders like Tyler will quickly pull ahead. Local governments are becoming increasingly aware of the threats of AI-enhanced hacking and are turning to better-known providers to help. Even larger municipalities aren’t immune. In 2023, the city of Dallas spent months recovering from an attack that hindered the city’s 911 emergency services, among others.\n\nAnalysts at Morningstar note that Tyler “used to fight for every $100,000 deal,” given how penny-pinching local governments could be. But now that Tyler has established enough of a reputation, political leaders are now calling up Tyler for products. Analysts believe the company’s net income will surge 14% this year and 16% the next.\n\nTyler Technologies is so obscure that even InvestorPlace.com rarely covers this blue-chip firm. Alex Sirois last wrote about Tyler almost a year ago in an article titled “The 7 Most Undervalued Stocks and Cryptos 2023.” And Ian Bezek hasn’t mentioned the firm since 2022.\n\nBut make no mistake. The risks of cybersecurity threats are growing. At Davos this year, JPMorgan’s head of wealth management revealed that her firm receives 45 billion hacking attempts per day – a figure only made possible by AI automation. And though top-tier firms like Tyler Technologies aren’t immune from data breaches either, governments are increasingly wanting to roll the dice on the most established players. Shares of Tyler likely have a 15%-20% upside in 2024.\n\nThe 10 Stocks of the AI Wars\n\nThese four companies will slowly grind higher as governments re-onshore their AI and chipmaking needs. A similar fight happened in the 1970s through the early 1990s between the U.S. and Japan, and governments this time around are even more aware of the risks of falling behind.\n\nBut Eric sees even greater potential for many smaller companies. These relatively unknown firms have even greater upside, thanks to their smaller starting points. And many investors will only need to land one “multibagger” to turn an ordinary portfolio into an extraordinary one.\n\nIn fact, Eric has spotted a catalyst that he believes will kick the AI Wars into even higher gear on Feb. 1… That’s why he’s holding the 2024 AI Wars Summit on Tuesday, January 23, at 7 p.m. Eastern.\n\nDuring this event, Eric will explain the impact of this date, why he believes it could make or break investors’ financial success this year, and what you can do to position yourself accordingly.\n\nClick here now to save your spot.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "12 Stocks Near Record Highs Thanks to Bullish Consumer Sentiment",
        "content": "The stock market is off to a solid start of 2024. All the major indices are at or near all-time highs, thanks in large part to bullish sentiment for tech. Artificial intelligence is going to change the world (according to Wall Street and Silicon Valley at least) and that’s led companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to all hit new all-time highs in the process.\n\nBut tech stocks aren’t the only companies marching to new records. Several consumer stocks are also setting fresh milestones this year, powered by bullish consumer sentiment, strong retail sales, diminishing inflation pressures and a still-healthy job market. Adding to the mix? Investors are convinced that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates as soon as March and most certainly by May, a move that could fuel spending even further.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s a look at a dozen consumer stocks trading at or near their all-time peaks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) and Mastercard (MA)\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA): The credit card and debit card giants are benefiting from the American consumer’s continued willingness to shop until they drop. Both stocks have gained about 20% in the past 12 months and have outperformed the broader market over the past five years, with Visa nearly doubling and Mastercard soaring more than 115%. Visa and Mastercard each have a consistent track record of reporting earnings that have topped Wall Street estimates, and both companies are expected to report double-digit annual profit gains for the foreseeable future.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD), Chipotle (CMG), and Wingstop (WING)\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING): Busy consumers are more than happy to order fast food. And that’s great news for these three popular restaurant chains. The December retail sales report showed that sales at food and drinking spots were up more than 11% from a year ago. Mickey D’s, Chipotle and Wingstop have also boosted their mobile ordering capabilities in the past few years, leading to surging demand from people looking to make the fast-food experience even more convenient.\n\nStory continues\n\nUber (UBER)\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER): The ride-hailing giant is also increasingly dominating the food delivery business thanks to its Uber Eats subsidiary and acquisition of Postmates in 2020. Its Uber Eats delivers from many top restaurant chains. Profits for the delivery business grew more rapidly than the mobility (ride-hailing) business for Uber in the third quarter. And Uber’s diverse business model seems to be giving it a big leg up on top competitors; Uber’s stock has surged nearly 80% in the past two years while DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) have both fallen.\n\nCostco (COST), Abercrombie (ANF), and Dick’s Sporting (DKS)\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST), Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS): People love to shop for gigantic vats of ketchup and other super-sized items at wholesale retail giant Costco. The company  remains one of America’s top retailers, with analysts predicting more than $250 billion in sales this year. And who says that the shopping mall is dead? Trendy clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, which also owns the Hollister and Gilly Hicks chains, is thriving. Sales are expected to rise nearly 15% in 2024. Finally, Dick’s Sporting Goods continues to dominate the market for team apparel and sports equipment. Sales are steadily growing, and analysts have consistently boosted their earnings estimates for this year and 2025.\n\nMarriott (MAR), Hilton (HLT), and IHG (IHG)\n\nMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT) and InterContinental Hotels Group (NYSE:IHG): The Covid-19-induced slowdown in travel seems like ancient history now. People are taking vacations again and going on business trips. That’s great news for the traditional hotel chains. Marriott, Hilton, and Holiday Inn owner IHG are all near record highs despite competition from home sharing giant Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). This trio of lodging stocks are all expected to post average annual earnings increases north of 15% over the next few years. Looks like many consumers still enjoy having room service and getting their beds made.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

        "title": "Which Chinese Stock Is the Most Attractive Pick in 2024?",
        "content": "The Chinese economy was expected to rebound strongly following the end of stringent Covid-19-led lockdowns. However, the recovery has been slower than anticipated and has adversely impacted investor sentiment on Chinese stocks. After a dismal 2023, Chinese stocks remain under pressure and started the year on a rough note, as companies continue to await robust stimulus measures by the government to spur domestic demand.\n\nChina’s property market crisis, growing deflationary risks, subdued demand, and rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China are expected to continue to weigh on the stocks of the world’s second-largest economy over the near term. Nonetheless, Wall Street is upbeat about several Chinese stocks that are listed in the U.S., given their long-term growth potential.\n\nBearing this backdrop in mind, I used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to compare the following Chinese stocks and pick the most attractive one, as per Wall Street analysts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) continue to decline this year after ending 2023 in the red. Macroeconomic challenges in China, intense competition from rivals like PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and uncertainty related to the company’s reorganization plans have dragged down the tech giant’s stock.\n\nEarlier this month, Bank of America analyst Joyce Ju lowered the price target for Alibaba stock to $106 from $113. However, she maintained a “buy” rating. The analyst expects the company’s fiscal Q3 revenue growth to slow down to 5% compared to 9% in the previous quarter due to near-term “turbulence” in the Taobao and Tmall Group’s revenue amid its strategic transition.\n\nDespite near-term headwinds, most analysts remain bullish on Alibaba. This is due to its dominance in the Chinese e-commerce space, solid fundamentals, and prospects in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). The company ended the fiscal second quarter with free cash flow of RMB 45.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 27%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a solid cash position, Alibaba is well-equipped to pursue growth opportunities in lucrative areas like generative AI. It is worth noting that the company recently initiated dividends to boost shareholder returns.\n\nOverall, Alibaba scores Wall Street’s “strong buy” consensus rating based on 18 buys and two holds. The average price target of $118.60 for BABA stock implies nearly 73% upside potential.\n\nNio (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) declined significantly in 2023 and continue to be under pressure this year. Investors remain concerned about the company’s fluctuating performance, macro woes, and continued losses. Also, the price war triggered by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also hit Nio and other players.\n\nNonetheless, the company is taking initiatives to reduce costs and enhance efficiency to address concerns about its profitability. Meanwhile, on Jan. 1, Nio reported a nearly 31% rise in its deliveries in 2023 to 160,038 vehicles.\n\nLooking ahead, Nio is optimistic about its ET9 model, an executive sedan. Deliveries for the vehicle will likely commence in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nRecently, Bank of America analyst Ming-Hsun Lee downgraded Nio stock to “hold” from “buy” with a price target of $9, citing disappointing sales and valuation concerns. The analyst expects the company’s sales to face hurdles in the first three quarters of this year due to the lack of new model launches and a potential slowdown in volume growth. The analyst also projects higher-than-anticipated operating expenses due to increased spending on marketing campaigns.\n\nWall Street has a “moderate buy” consensus rating on Nio based on six buys and four holds. At $10.86, the average price target for Nio stock indicates about 82% upside potential.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nMacro worries and sluggish growth trends in China’s EV market have impacted investor sentiment for Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock so far in 2024, even though the company’s performance has been impressive in recent quarters.\n\nEarlier this month, Li Auto reported 50,353 deliveries for December 2023, which marked a 137% year-over-year increase. With this, the company’s 2023 deliveries increased 182% to 376,030 units. It is also worth noting that unlike several unprofitable EV makers, Li Auto delivered profits in each of the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nOverall, Li Auto seems well-positioned for continued growth. Its new EV models like MEGA, the recently announced partnership with chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and operating efficiency and cost-management efforts are boosting its profitability.\n\nRecently, analysts at Bank of America called Li Auto one of their “Top Picks” for 2024. Additionally, they reiterated a “buy” rating on the stock with a price target of $55. Analysts at the bank expect Li Auto to win incremental share in the Chinese EV market this year, driven by its expanding product offerings. The bullish stance is also backed by a rise in Li Auto’s penetration in the luxury/premium EV segment and a solid pipeline of upcoming models.\n\nOverall, Li Auto scores a “strong buy” consensus rating backed by six unanimous buys. The average price target of $53.58 for Li Auto stock implies over 95% upside from current levels.\n\nIn conclusion, Wall Street is highly bullish on Li Auto and Alibaba. It is cautiously optimistic about Nio due to profitability concerns. Currently, analysts see higher upside potential in Li Auto than in the other two Chinese stocks. Management’s solid execution and continued demand for Li Auto’s EVs should boost the company’s revenue and profitability in the years ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sirisha Bhogaraju did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nSirisha Bhogaraju has over 15 years of experience in financial research.

        "title": "3 REIT Upgrades To Start The Week",
        "content": "As an investor, it's always great to see positive news on one of your stocks because it's likely to increase the share price. The good news could be a dividend raise, a strong earnings report, a new product, service or alliance or an upgrade from an analyst at a prestigious brokerage or bank. Right or wrong, the recommendations of analysts often carry a lot of weight.\n\nThree real estate investment trusts (REITs) just received analyst upgrades to begin a new week. Two of the REITs had price targets announced well above present prices, and one received a solid price target boost. Take a look.\n\nAgree Realty Corp. (NYSE:ADC) is a Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based triple-net-lease REIT that focuses on retail properties. Its portfolio includes 2,135 owned and operated properties totaling 44 million square feet across 49 states. Sixty-nine percent of its tenants are investment grade, including well-known names like Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE:BBY) Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG) and Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR).\n\nAgree Realty was founded as Agree Development Co. in 1971 and went public as a REIT on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994 as Agree Realty Corp.\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 24, funds from operations (FFO) of $1 per share beat the estimates of $0.99 and was above FFO of $0.96 in the third quarter of 2022. Revenue of $136.81 million beat the estimates of $134.97 million and was 24.3% above revenue of $110.07 million in the third quarter of 2022. Agree Realty will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 13.\n\nAgree Realty pays a monthly dividend, making it a favorite among income investors to pay regular monthly bills. In January 2021, it began paying monthly dividends of $0.21 per share. Since then, the dividend has grown by 17.06% to $0.247 per share. The annual dividend of $2.96 presently yields 4.78%.\n\nAnalysts seem to be trying to one-up each other in raising price targets for Agree Realty this month. On Jan. 10, Mizuho maintained a Neutral rating on Agree Realty and raised the price target to $65. On Jan. 16, Truist Securities maintained its Buy rating on Agree and raised the price target to $70.\n\nStory continues\n\nPicking up where the other analysts left off, on Jan. 22, JMP Securities analyst Mitch Germain upgraded Agree Realty from Market Perform to Market Outperform and announced a $71 price target, the highest target among all analysts. From its most recent closing price of $61.09, that represents a 16.22% increase.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%. Ken Griffin says Miami will take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $100 before that happens.\n\nPlymouth Industrial REITInc. (NYSE:PLYM) is a Boston-based industrial REIT that owns and operates 156 properties with over 34 million square feet in 13 East Coast and Midwestern markets. Its portfolio occupancy as of Dec. 31 was 98.6%. During the fourth quarter of 2023, it leased an aggregate of 966,167 square feet, with a 23.4% increase in rental rates on a cash basis from these leases.\n\nIn 2023, Plymouth outperformed larger and more well-known industrial REITs such as Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) and Rexford Industrial Realty Inc. (NYSE:REXR). Its total return, even with the interest rate hikes that decimated many REITs, was an admirable 29.88%. Still, this smaller REIT receives far less publicity than its rivals. But one analyst has just taken notice.\n\nOn Jan. 22, JMP Securities analyst Germain upgraded Plymouth Industrial REIT from Market Perform to Market Outperform and announced a $27 price target. From its most recent closing price of $22.69, that represents an 18.99% increase.\n\nPlymouth Industrial will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 22.\n\nDigital Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:DLR) is an Austin, Texas-based data center REIT with more than 300 facilities in large metro areas in 23 countries. It calls itself \"the largest global provider of cloud-and-carrier-neutral data center, colocation and interconnection solutions.\" Its customers include Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM).\n\nDigital Realty pays a quarterly dividend of $1.22 per share. The annual dividend of $4.88 presently yields 3.55%.\n\nSince November 2004, Digital Realty Trust has had a total return of 1,527.41% or an average annual total return of 15.64%. That long-term return makes it one of the best-performing REITs over the past two decades.\n\nOn Jan. 22, Digital Realty announced the expansion of its service orchestration platform ServiceFabric. The platform interconnects workflow participants, applications, clouds and ecosystems on PlatformDIGITAL, its global data center platform.\n\nOn Jan. 22, Scotiabank analyst Maher Yaghi upgraded Digital Realty from Sector Perform to Sector Outperform and raised the price target from $132 to $157. From its most recent closing price of $137.34, that represents a 14.31% potential increase.\n\nDigital Realty will announce its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 15.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that analysts are only correct about 50% of the time and rather than relying solely on analyst's ratings, investors should perform their own due diligence before making any stock purchases.\n\nWeekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

        "title": "3 Stocks Still Worth Buying at 52-Week Highs",
        "content": "After a sluggish start to the year, the stock market has quickly turned around and now sits at an all-time high.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index closed at an all-time high on Jan. 19 as investors resumed buying equities with a vengeance. Closing at 4,839.81, it surpassed its previous record high set in January 2022. Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and technology-focused Nasdaq 100 indices are currently at record highs. The bull run has brought up the share prices of many stocks.\n\nWhile technology stocks continue to lead, many non-tech stocks that are presently on an upswing, trading at 52-week highs. While investors might hesitate to take a position in a stock near peak, some stocks will likely continue rallying higher. And that makes now a fine time to allocate capital. Strong earnings and favorable market conditions will keep these equities moving upwards in coming months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s explore three stocks that are still worth buying at 52-week highs.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 24% so far in 2024, the stock of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at an all-time high on a split adjusted basis. Despite rising 210% in the last 52 weeks and leading the benchmark S&P 500, plenty of reasons exist to buy NVDA stock. As many analysts have pointed out, Nvidia’s share price is currently not that expensive. In fact, it is actually the cheapest among the Magnificent 7 securities.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s stock has run far in the past 12 months, its earnings have grown at an even faster clip. For Q4 of 2023, Nvidia has forecast $20 billion in revenue, which implies 231% year-over-year (YOY) growth. For Q3 of last year, the company reported that revenue in its data center chip unit grew 279% YOY. The company’s growth justifies NVDA’s big rally. However, the stock has trailed the financial performance, indicating more room to run.\n\nThe median price target on NVDA stock is now $650 a share, implying an additional 10% upside from current levels. And, this is prior to company reports of Q4 2023 numbers coming Feb. 21.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) DECK stock: a display of three UGG boots of various colors in a shop with the logo displayed above them\n\nSource: BalkansCat / Shutterstock\n\nThe stock of shoemaker Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is riding high due to the growing popularity of its Hoka running shoes.\n\nThe company, whose other brands include Uggs and Teva sandals, has seen its share price rise 12% in early January, hitting an all-time high. In the last 12 months, DECK has gained 80%, bringing its five-year return to 504%. Further, the share price performance of Deckers Outdoor is being driven by the company’s earnings, which show record growth.\n\nThe company’s most recent earnings for Q3 of last year crushed Wall Street forecasts. DECK reported earnings per shares of $6.82, far ahead of the $4.40 consensus estimate. Sales in the quarter increased 24.7% YOY and hit $1.09 billion, topping the expected $960.62 million. Impressively, the company’s direct-to-consumer sales grew nearly 40% in the quarter. Expect another move higher in DECK stock when the company announces its Q4 earnings on Feb. 1.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter languishing for the better part of two years, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) gained 34% since it bottomed in late October last year.\n\nNow, GS is trading at a 52-week high. While the investment bank’s recently released Q4 2023 results helped the share price, much of the turnaround is due to a recovery in Wall Street deals. In recent weeks, several high-profile and richly valued initial public offerings (IPOs) have been announced, which are expected to be a windfall for Goldman Sachs.\n\nSince the start of the year, social media platform Reddit announced that it plans to go public in March at a valuation of as much as $10 billion. Also, Europe’s Amer Sports, best known as the maker of Wilson tennis rackets, has announced plans to go public on the NYSE by late January at a valuation of $8.7 billion. Recently, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman said that 100 companies have filed confidentiality to hold IPOs this year.\n\nAll the deals could be a boon for Goldman Sachs. It continues to get most of its revenue from IPOs and mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and DECK. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw their stock prices jump thanks to their big push to invest and make advancements in AI. Thanks to that outsized growth, there is a potential that they will continue to maintain their dominance on the S&P 500 (^GSPC). As they hold their dominance, the outcome of their earnings can have major sway over the broader market.\n\nKen Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss upcoming earnings from major tech companies and how they could have a sizable impact on the broader market that investors would not want to miss out on.\n\nWhen it comes to expectations for the outcome of potential tech earnings, Mahoney affirms : \"There could be a little sell on the news reaction, but I think the guidance is going to be key. The law of big numbers is incredible, I mean Nvidia as an example, last 12 months has doubled topline revenue, expected to double topline revenue in '24 and '25 and the CEO of Nvidia said 'Hey, we're in the second, third inning.' I hear this all the time. 'Ken, I missed it, I missed it.' Well, the CEO, who is really at the epicenter of all this, is telling you that we're probably in the second or third inning. You might not want to stay around until the ninth or extra innings, but there's a pretty long runway to make some money akin to what we saw in the mid 1990s. \"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino",

        "title": "5 Surging Growth Stocks to Buy for 2024",
        "content": "Last week, I wrote how 2024 would be all about earnings. Corporate fortunes are diverging, interest rates are stabilizing, and 2024 is shaping up to be a year when company performance matters more than big-picture macroeconomic stories.\n\nWe’re already seeing these effects. Last Wednesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) announced that its December revenues had handily beat expectations. The news would send Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) up 2% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) down 2%. It turns out AI chips are booming, but consumer electronics are not.\n\nSimilar trends are emerging in everything from streaming services to uranium miners. We’re no longer in a “rising tide” environment where every company moves in the same direction. And that means investors need to keep a close eye on corporate performance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo separate these winning firms from the laggards, InvestorPlace analyst Louis Navellier has long used earnings revisions as a key metric. Companies with rising Wall Street forecasts tend to perform better even after the forecasts have been publicly announced, while those with declining revisions tend to underperform long after the news. These insights have long been incorporated in his proven Portfolio Grader system and have helped Louis uncover the top-performing stock on the S&P 500 every year for 12 years running.\n\nIn 2023, we saw this effect play out in black and white (or red and green). An investor who bought the 10 companies with the highest upward revisions in the S&P 500 would have walked away with a 25.5% gain. That included companies like chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and cruise liner Carnival (NYSE:CCL). The former saw its 2023 earnings growth revised from 3.3% to 19.6% in Q4 2022… and subsequently saw shares rise 35% over the following 12 months. The latter would jump 130% over the same period!\n\nMeanwhile, those buying the bottom-10 companies would have fared far worse. Among these firms were Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), which essentially ended the year flat. Those buying the bottom-30 firms by earnings revisions would have also landed companies like Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY) and First Republic Bank (OTCMKTS:FRCB), two now-bankrupt firms.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow to Invest for 2024\n\nWe’ll see even more of these divergences this year. As I wrote here last week, investors are running out of patience with startups like QuantumScape (NYSE:QS). Competitors like BYD (NYSE:BYDDY) are racing ahead, and startups are finding it harder than before to raise cheap capital.\n\nThat means investors will need to keep a close eye on earnings revisions in 2024. To get you started, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com, our free news site, write this week on five companies that look set to succeed in the coming year.\n\n5 Surging Growth Stocks to Buy: Duolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nA-rated language-learning app Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) has one of the highest upward earnings revisions in the Russell 3000 index. Over the last quarter, the Pittsburgh-based tech firm has seen its 2024 earnings estimates rise from 15 cents to 82 cents, a fivefold increase.\n\nAs Marc Guberti notes in a recent update for InvestorPlace.com, much of this has to do with Duolingo’s expansion into new services, which is keeping user growth high. He notes how the app grew daily active users by 63% last quarter and has raised its full-year guidance as a result.\n\nJosh Enomoto also notes how Duolingo has been aggressively using AI to reduce workforce expenses and create new content. The company is now using artificial intelligence to help create work “dramatically faster” than before.\n\nOf course, Duolingo isn’t for everyone. As Guberti warns, the company’s high growth means shares trade at a significant premium at 119 times forward earnings. But the numbers are clear: Duolingo remains a high-growth company that’s transitioning itself from negative to positive earnings. If it continues to maintain such growth, history tells us that Duolingo has plenty of upside ahead.\n\n2. Spotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nA-rated Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) gets a special mention in Louis Navellier’s Market360 this week. The online streaming service has been accumulating new subscribers at an astonishing rate, and earnings have been revised up as a result. During the fourth quarter, Wall Street analysts moved their fiscal year 2024 earnings estimates from 37 cents per share to $2.10 – one of the highest revisions on the market.\n\nHere’s more from Louis and his team:\n\nSpotify currently has 574 million monthly average users – up 26% from a year ago. Of those, 226 million are premium users, providing Spotify with most of its revenue. In the third quarter, Spotify generated $2.91 billion from its premium members, and only $447 million through advertising directed at its free users.\n\nThe trick will be for Spotify to continue to convert free users to premium members. As it does that, the profits will continue to rise.\n\nAt InvestorPlace.com, Muslim Farooque agrees. He picks Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Spotify as his top 3 Stocks to Play the Rise of the Subscription Economy.\n\nStreaming services can only succeed if they have a critical mass of content. And as the leading firm in music and podcast streaming, Spotify likely will have the easiest time expanding its user base while monetizing existing customers.\n\n3. GitLab (GTLB) In this photo illustration the GitLab (GTLB) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn December, at InvestorPlace.com, Yiannis Zourmpanos noted how software development and IT operations (DevOps) platform company GitLab (NASDAQ:GTLB) was expanding its business with high-value customers. He believes this disruptive tech stock is set to soar by 2025:\n\nA substantial 37% year-over-year growth, from 638 customers to 874, suggests GitLab’s lead in attracting and retaining larger enterprises… GitLab’s consistently high dollar-based net retention rate was 128% in Q3. This reflects the company’s success in expanding revenue within its existing customer base.\n\nThe numbers suggest the same outcome. Over the past three months, analysts have revised their forward earnings estimates from 16 cents to 35 cents, more than doubling initial forecasts. In short, GitLab is bringing AI to software development and deployment, and renewed focus on AI-enhanced productivity tools has put the San Francisco-based firm’s growth into high gear.\n\nAnalyst Luke Lango rightly agrees. In a special report for Early Stage Investor (subscription required) he calls GitLab one of the Top 5 “highest-quality AI software applications” to buy for 2024, and says that shares have “likely upside into and beyond 2025.” Though few outside the industry have ever heard of GitLab, that matters little for a firm growing earnings at such a rapid clip.\n\n4. SoFi (SOFI) the Social Finance (SoFi stock) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis week, Louis’ team also highlights SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) as a company where Wall Street May Soon Turn Back to Bullish. The New Year’s selloff has pushed SoFi’s shares back into the $8 range, and a potentially strong earnings release due on Jan. 29 could send shares higher:\n\nThe next big event for SOFI stock is just a few weeks away. That would be the release of the company’s Q4/full year 2023 results, post-market on Jan. 29…\n\nMuch suggests that SoFi will crush it again with results this quarter, as it did last quarter. With the student loan moratorium lifted and SoFi’s non-student lending operations growing, the company is likely to report its first profitable quarter.\n\nThe online banking firm has seen a strong upward revision in earnings. Over the past quarter, analysts have doubled their 2024 earnings per share estimates from 3 cents to 6 cents. 2025 earnings expectations are now as high as 23 cents.\n\nThat’s because banks (and fintechs) tend to benefit when rates are elevated, since they can earn higher risk-free interest on customer deposits. SoFi also lacks a corporate-lending business, which tend to see fewer benefits of rising rates.\n\nAnalysts expect SoFi’s net interest income (the profits generated from this lending activity) to more than double this fiscal year to $1.3 billion, eclipsing the revenues earned from other activities.\n\n5. DraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings (DKNG) logo, magnified, on its app.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher/Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Faisal Humayun hones in on DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) this week at InvestorPlace.com as a stock Primed to Explode Your Net Worth by 2030. The firm has a strong business, Humayun says, and is supported by industry tailwinds:\n\nDraftKings has surged by 183% in the last 12 months. The rally from deeply oversold levels is likely to sustain with profitability on the horizon. Further, with a big addressable market for online sports betting (OSB) and iGaming, I believe that DKNG stock will continue to create value.\n\nEssentially, DraftKings is rising on a wave of gambling legalizations. U.S. governors are seeing how states like New York are plugging funding gaps with new gaming tax revenues. And everyone wants a piece.\n\nSince October, analysts have revised their next-year earnings estimates for DraftKings from negative 50 cents to negative 26 cents, a 50% improvement. And 2025 figures are up even more; Wall Street now expects DraftKings to earn a positive 80 cents per share by the end of the year.\n\nTogether, the numbers suggest that DraftKings still has more room to run. Humayun expects margins to continue expanding for the next 12 to 24 months. If that’s the case, shares have at least another 22% upside from here.\n\nBeating the Market\n\nWall Street analysts are generally quite good at their work. Many have million-dollar research budgets at their disposal, and top analysts often know corporate bosses on a personal level.\n\nLouis and I are former Wall Streeters, and we’ve both seen this “old boys club” in action. It’s no surprise to either of us how powerful earnings revisions can be.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts also can make mistakes. In January 2023, analysts had just slashed their expectations for Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). As a group, Wall Street expected Meta’s earnings to decline 12.5% the following year.\n\nBut they were wrong. Meta would instead see a resurgence in the ad industry and the rise of generative AI. Earnings would instead rise 60% for 2023, sending shares up 145%. 2023 also saw other surprises, including resurgences in U.S. chipmaking and homebuilders. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) would see similarly unexpected turnarounds. No matter how skilled analysts are, some things are exceedingly difficult to predict.\n\nSo, what if you could beat Wall Street at its own game?\n\nTo do that, Louis has teamed up with earnings season expert Landon Swan reveal a revolutionary AI program with the power to predict the future earnings of more than 500 companies with uncanny accuracy.

        "title": "Think Nvidia Is Too Risky? The Smartest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Over the past year, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the talk of the town and one of the stock market's best-performing large companies. The company designs the kind of advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) technology needed for artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, the GPU leader's revenue and earnings have been skyrocketing.\n\nSales surged 206% year over year in the company's third quarter, and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings rose 593%. With guidance for sales growth of roughly 231% in the fourth quarter, Nvidia expects the incredible momentum to continue in the near term.\n\nHowever, the combination of the company's explosive stock gains and the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry suggests that Nvidia may be too hot for some investors to handle. Additionally, the company could see some uneven performance due to bans on advanced chip sales to China and upcoming performance comparisons to recent periods that likely benefited from Chinese customers frontloading GPU orders to get ahead of regulations.\n\nOver the long term, there's still a good chance that Nvidia will deliver strong returns. But another \"Magnificent Seven\" AI stock is offering a risk-reward profile that's probably a better fit for many investors.\n\nIf you've got your financial bases covered and are looking to invest $1,000 or more into a sturdy AI leader, read on to see why Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) stands out as the smartest buy right now.\n\nMicrosoft is on top of the AI world\n\nMicrosoft recently unseated Apple as the world's largest company as measured by market capitalization, although the two are going back and forth this month over who is on top (Apple currently has it). I think there's a very good chance that the software giant will regain and and then retain the title for much of the next decade. For investors seeking AI growth stocks backed by dependable businesses and strong competitive moats, Microsoft continues to be a great play.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven as it faced macroeconomic headwinds and one-time tax liabilities over the last year, Microsoft continued to post sales growth and strong profits. Now positive performance momentum is accelerating again. Data source: Microsoft. Chart by author.\n\nMicrosoft grew its revenue 13% year over year to reach $56.5 billion in its September-ended quarter. The company's operating income rose 25% year over year to hit $26.9 billion, and its net income jumped 27% to hit $22.3 billion.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud infrastructure platform is at the heart of its surging profitability. AI developers are turning to the company's cloud offering to develop, launch, and scale their applications, and this tailwind is still just starting.\n\nMicrosoft is integrating AI into its operating systems and productivity software, and the company's Copilot software also makes it a frontrunner in the potentially explosive AI personal assistant space. Microsoft is even designing its own AI chips. Virtually every aspect of the tech leader's business looks poised to benefit from artificial intelligence.\n\nIn addition to its own internal projects, Microsoft also owns a substantial stake in OpenAI -- the company responsible for applications including ChatGPT and DALL-E. If you're looking for a well-rounded AI stock, Microsoft is tough to beat.\n\nMicrosoft will even pay you to own its stock\n\nAided by strong profitability, Microsoft has paid a dividend since 2003 and raised its payout annually for 18 years straight. While the company's current yield of roughly 0.7% won't be attractive to investors looking for big payouts right away, this is a dividend growth stock that's perfectly suited to be a set-it-and-forget-it portfolio component. MSFT Dividend Chart\n\nMicrosoft's business is enormously profitable, and it has plenty of room for long-term expansion. In addition to sending the company's share price higher, profits generated on the back of AI should also help the company continue to increase the amount of cash that it returns to shareholders through dividends.\n\nWith strong business momentum, plenty of untapped AI opportunities, and an appealing returned income component, Microsoft is a top buy for investors seeking strong AI stocks.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 16, 2024\n\nKeith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Nvidia Stock",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation  (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares closed slightly higher during Monday’s session.\n\nThe company is expected to release earnings results for the recent quarter next month, with analysts anticipating quarterly earnings at $4.50 per share on revenue of $20.18 billion.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, is looking to boost its AI chip sales in India significantly through a deal with Yotta, an Indian data center operator. The $500 million deal brings Nvidia's total orders from Yotta to $1 billion, marking a substantial increase in Yotta's AI cloud services.\n\nSunil Gupta, CEO and co-founder of Yotta shared that the order includes nearly 16,000 Nvidia H100 and GH200 AI chips, with delivery expected by March 2025, Reuters reported.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Nvidia, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Nvidia has a dividend yield of 0.03%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 4 cents a share (16 cents a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Nvidia dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Nvidia’s $0.16 dividend: $6,000 / $0.16 = 37,500 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $22,370,250 worth of Nvidia, or 37,500 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.16 = 7,500 shares, or $4,474,050 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nView more earnings on NVDA\n\nAlso Read: Top 4 Consumer Stocks That May Collapse This Month\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained 0.3% to close at $596.54 on Monday.\n\nRead More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

        "content": "Nvidia initiated, Tractor Supply downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nTD Cowen upgraded Exxon Mobil(XOM) to Outperform from Market Perform with an unchanged price target of $115. The firm sees \"more compelling upside\" saying the stock has declined with an unchanged valuation. Truist upgraded Enphase Energy(ENPH) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $145, up from $85. While the firm anticipates the company's sales guidance for Q1 could come in below Street estimates, it also believes buy-side estimates for Enphase are meaningfully below consensus. Truist upgraded Sunnova Energy(NOVA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $18, up from $10. Given the stock's significant underperformance to start the year and still significant short interest, Truist sees potential for the shares to rally on the Q4 print should the company be able to provide confidence around its 2024 outlook. Jefferies upgraded Teva Pharmaceutical(TEVA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $14, up from $10. The firm is bullish heading into the company's 2024 guidance, saying consensus revenue estimates look conservative \"despite several tailwinds at play.\" Evercore ISI upgraded Duke Energy(DUK) to Outperform from In Line with a price target of $108, up from $90. The company has a \"much cleaner story\" after its non-regulated renewable asset sale and North Carolina rate case outcome, says the firm, which sees Duke as having the best total return potential among regulated large cap utility names.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nStephens downgraded Tractor Supply (TSCO) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $240, up from $226. The firm continues to believe in the long-term growth opportunity and believes buyside sentiment remains overly negative on the potential 2024 guidance, but thinks recent outperformance could limit shares in the near to intermediate term. TD Cowen downgraded Chevron (CVX) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $150, down from $170. The company's largest growth drivers, the Permian and Tengizchevroil, could continue to be discounted by the market due to execution concerns, while the Hess Corp. (HES) deal may not result in annual net cash inflows until 2027, the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan downgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Underweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $80. The firm continues to see Coinbase as the dominant U.S. exchange in the crypto ecosystem and a leader in cryptocurrency trading and investing globally, but thinks the catalyst in bitcoin exchange traded funds that has pushed the ecosystem out of its winter will disappoint market participants. UBS downgraded Philip Morris(PM) to Sell from Buy with a price target of $86.50, down from $105. The firm's analysis suggests growth of next generation products, which make up 20% of tobacco industry revenue, is likely to slow over the next five years, largely due to heated tobacco. Wells Fargo downgraded Bill (BILL) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $75, down from $80. Despite shares trading well below historical levels, the firm believes Bill faces a growing list of risks which make it difficult to be overly constructive at this time.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nCantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Nvidia (NVDA) with an Overweight rating and $775 price target. Nvidia remains the artificial intelligence compute company where the opportunity is not a percentage of data center revenues, but rather a percentage of worldwide IT spending, the firm tells investors in a research note.  Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of AMD (AMD) with an Overweight rating and $190 price target. The firm views AMD as a key beneficiary of the market's search for alternatives to Nvidia in accelerated computing.  Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Micron (MU) with an Overweight rating and $100 price target. The firm contends that the combination of improving pricing, supply discipline, improving end markets, and the incremental DRAM demand from Generative AI sets up Micron to see \"a meaningful recovery\" in revenues, margins, and free cash flows in 2024-2025.  Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with an Overweight rating and $1,300 price target. The firm sees a long runway for EPS, free cash flow and dividend growth for Broadcom with vision to annualized earnings power of $65 exiting 2025.  Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Qualcomm (QCOM) with a Neutral rating and $150 price target. The firm expects Qualcomm to be a leader at the edge for artificial intelligence, though it suspects use cases are unlikely until the 2025-2026 timeframe. Cantor also started coverage of Intel (INTC) with a Neutral rating.",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights American Water Works Company, NVIDIA, A. O. Smith and Arista Networks",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, A. O. Smith Corp. AOS and Arista Networks, Inc. ANET.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Solid S&P 500 Stocks to Bet On as Index Hits All-Time High\n\nWall Street showed volatility to start the New Year. However, stocks have since then rebounded and three major indexes officially entered the bull market last week, with the S&P 500 Index hitting an all-time high. The S&P 500 closed at 4,839.81 points on Friday to record its highest close since January 2022.\n\nWall Street had a solid 2023 after a disappointing 2022 as 40-year-high inflation took a toll on stocks and the Federal Reserve implemented an aggressive interest rate hike policy to normalize the situation. This saw the S&P 500 giving up 19% in 2022.\n\nThe high interest rate regime continued in 2023 but markets rebounded as inflation started showing signs of easing. The Fed left interest rates unchanged for the first time in July last year before keeping it steady in its last three FOMC meetings after hiking rates by 525 basis points.\n\nSlowing inflation and a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve sent stocks on a year-end rally that saw the S&P 500 recording a 24% gain in 2023 as fears of a recession waned.\n\nS&P to Rally in 2024\n\nEconomists now expect that the economy will make a softer landing as inflation has eased considerably. The Federal Reserve has also hinted at cutting interest rates this year. Although the optimism among investors about the first interest rate cut coming in March has somewhat wanted, rate cuts are happening for sure in 2024.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, 47.2% feel that a 25-basis point rate cut is possible in March. This was, however, more than 90% at the beginning of this year. Several Fed officials have indicated at least three 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates bode well for stock markets. A low risk-free interest rate will bring down the discount rate, leading to an increase in the net present value of investments in equities.\n\nAlso, the economy is on solid ground. The third-quarter GDP grew 4.9% and according to the Atlanta Fed, the nation's GDP is projected to grow 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in four S&P 500 stocks such as American Water Works Company, Inc., NVIDIA Corp., A. O. Smith Corp. and Arista Networks, Inc. that have a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmerican Water Works Company, Inc. provides essential water services to over 14 million customers in 24 states and has an employee strength of 6,500.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 60 days. AWK presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Stocks Jim Cramer Recommended Selling, But Billionaires Love Them. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Stocks Jim Cramer Recommended Selling, But Billionaires Love Them.\n\nJim Cramer recently talked about the top themes of 2024 he's eyeing. Cramer said that he likes to talk about themes that investors can always fall back to. Cramer's top theme for 2024 is, unsurprisingly, AI. Related to this theme, Cramer talked about his expectations for this year and said that he's expecting a few stocks from the Magnificent Seven group to fall from their 2023 glory. Some Mag. 7 stocks Cramer has been recommending investors in 2023 include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nCramer Expects a Difficult 2024 for Tesla\n\nCramer said that Tesla will be first to go down in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks. Cramer criticized Elon Musk's latest demands in which he said he needs to take a 25% control of Tesla in order to make it a leader in AI and robotics. Cramer called this \"pure hubris.\" Cramer also talked about some research reports which believe Apple will have a terrible time in the start of 2024 amid problems in China.\n\nCramer's Thoughts on Donald Trump\n\nRegarding the election 2024 theme, Cramer said that there has never been a president more friendly for the stock market than Donald Trump was.\n\n\"He measured himself by the Dow,\" Cramer said of Trump.\n\nCramer said that Trump will \"fight for the rich like no other\" and the analyst expects the former President of the US to speak against capital gain tax, which Cramer thought would result in \"market soaring.\" Stocks Jim Cramer Recommended Selling, But Billionaires Love Them\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first listed down all the stocks Jim Cramer has been recommending investors to sell or stay away from over the past 12 months. From these stocks we picked stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. We used Insider Monkey's proprietary database of billionaires and their stock holdings to find the number of billionaire investors for these companies\n\nStory continues\n\n11. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 6\n\nJim Cramer has long been bearish on Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) and recommending investors to stay away from this stock. Recently, Jim Cramer made the following comment about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT):\n\n\"Let’s stop fooling around. If you want bitcoin, buy bitcoin. I think bitcoin’s topping out, by the way, so I’m going to say, enough is enough and ka-ching is ka-ching.”\n\nIn November 2023, Jim Cramer had said that Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) does not make any money and investors should own Bitcoin directly if they want to get exposure to crypto.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of billionaires shows that six billionaires had stakes in Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT).\n\nJim Cramer is bearish on RIOT but recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n10. Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 7\n\nEarlier this month Jim Cramer categorically recommended investors to hit eject on semiconductor stock Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). Jim Cramer said that Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is not making any money.\n\n\" In this market, they’ve got to make money...Let’s just exit Navitas.”\n\nA total of seven billionaires in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nBaron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Navitas Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:NVTS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Navitas Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a leader in gallium nitride (GaN) power semiconductors and a smaller player in silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors. These are both new materials used as a base (substrate) on which to print power-oriented chip circuits. Shares fell during the quarter as the stock was trading at a premium valuation heading into the quarter, and investors were broadly concerned about underlying demand conditions in key end-markets like smartphones. Despite near-term concerns, the company reiterated its outlook to double revenues in 2023, reported strong design win momentum, and indicated opportunity pipeline growth. Navitas sells monolithically integrated GaN power integrated circuit chips (completed printed circuit systems on a chip), which provide greater reliability and performance compared to competitors that supply discrete power devices (multiple individual, larger components put together on a chip). It recently purchased a silicon control company to drive integration and performance even further, and its SiC products offer high performance across many different applications. The company’s high-power GaN product launches remain on track for data center, solar, and electric vehicle applications. We expect Navitas to gain share in the rapidly growing GaN and SiC power semiconductor markets over time, driven by its superior technology.”\n\n9. Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 7\n\nIn early January, Jim Cramer recommended investors to \"move on\" from petroleum services company Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW). Cramer said the stock has moved too much. Over the past one year the stock has gained about 61%. In November Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) posted third quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $0.49. Revenue in the quarter came in at $299.3 million, beating estimates by $7.39 million.\n\nAs of the end of the September quarter of 2023, seven billionaires tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW).\n\nThird Avenue Small-Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Finally, long-time holding, offshore oil services company, Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) rose 31% in the quarter, as more investors and operators recognized the importance of investing in fossil fuels to sustain long-term economic growth and national security. In a challenging environment for most asset classes, Energy was a considerable outperformer this past quarter, illustrating the potency of the investor pivot.”\n\n8. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 7\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Jim Cramer recommended investors to stay away from  solid state lithium battery company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). Cramer had said that there was \"nothing there\" for the stock. Over the  past 12 months the stock has lost about 10% in value.\n\nA total of seven billionaires in Insider Monkey's billionaires database held stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). Some notable billionaires having stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) include Ken Griffin, DE Shaw and Israel Englander.\n\n7. Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 8\n\nJim Cramer in 2023 recommended investors to sell optical materials company Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) shares since he said Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) was not making any money. However, Cramer acknowledged that Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) has a strong product.\n\nEarlier this month, Goldman Sachs published a list of stocks with weak pricing power that can outperform. Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) made it to the list.\n\nA total of eight billionaires in Insider Monkey's billionaire database had stakes in Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR).\n\nLiberty Park Capital made the following comment about Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“After its stock nearly doubled on enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence, Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) fell nearly 40% in one day after announcing weaker-than-expected 3Q guidance. We viewed the stock move as an over reaction and closed our short position.”\n\n6. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 8\n\nJim Cramer had been bearish on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) throughout 2023 and in December he said he was finally \"pulling the plug\" on the hydrogen fuel cell company.\n\nIn August 2023 Jim Cramer was saying that investors should take profits on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares should the stock bounce back. Over the past 12 months Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock has lost about 82% in value.\n\nStill, eight billionaires in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). Some notable billionaire stakeholders of Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) were Israel Englander, Steve Cohen, Ken Griffin and DE Shaw.\n\nUnlike PLUG, Cramer is bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Stocks 5 Stocks Jim Cramer Recommended Selling, But Billionaires Love Them.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires 13 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now George Soros and Jim Cramer Love These Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, NVIDIA NVDA, Salesforce CRM, and Amazon.com AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 S&P 500 Growth Stocks to Buy as Index Enjoys Bull Market\n\nThe S&P 500 bounced back in 2023 after taking a beating in the prior year, gaining an encouraging 24% as steady economic growth squashed any expectations of an impending recession, while price pressures came down to levels that compelled the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 was off to a rough start in 2024 as market participants took some profits in tech bigwigs such as Apple Inc.. But they recently returned to buy back those magnificent tech players, helping the S&P 500 enter a bull market. The broader index has soared more than 35% from its October 2022 low.\n\nFor the first time, the S&P 500 finished at a record close, in more than two years. The index has also set an intraday record high after gyrating in a tight trading range for nearly a month. The large-cap benchmark closed at 4,839.81 on Jan 19 and exceeded the previous record close of 4,796.56 achieved on Jan 3, 2022. Additionally, the index hit an intraday high of 4,842.07, easily topping the intraday record of 4,818.62 attained on Jan 4, 2022, per FactSet data.\n\nNow, bull markets generally tend to last for quite some time. The previous bull market that started in March 2020 continued for less than two years. What's more, the bull market that began before that prevailed for almost 10 years. It began from the Great Recession period till the outbreak of the coronavirus in February 2020. Similarly, the current bull market is expected to continue as stocks gain momentum, banking on a less hawkish Fed, upbeat consumer sentiment, and uptick in tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs inflation has started to show signs of cooling down, the Fed has kept its interest rates unchanged in the last meeting and is widely expected to trim rates this year. Interest rate cuts are always a boon for the stock market as they boost consumer outlays, decrease the cost of borrowings, and pep up the economy (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates in 2024).\n\nAmericans are anyhow feeling much more optimistic about the current and future business scenarios, thanks to the strength in the labor market. The University of Michigan stated that its consumer sentiment index surged 21.4% year over year in January and touched its highest level since July 2021. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, too, had touched the highest level in December since July (read more: Raise a Toast to These 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks in 2024).\n\nTech stocks, meanwhile, are gaining traction due to AI optimism. Taiwan Semiconductor's latest upbeat earnings report also bolstered confidence for the chip sector. Gains in mega-cap tech stocks eventually erased the S&P 500's 2024 losses. Hence, with the S&P 500 scaling upward, it's prudent for astute investors to place bets on growth stocks listed in the index.\n\nSome of the prominent names are NVIDIA, Salesforce, and Amazon.com.

        "title": "Buy Bitcoin on the Dip for Solid Returns: 5 Stocks in Focus",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market started 2024 on a positive note after an impressive rally last year. The much-hyped reformation in the cryptocurrency space took place on Jan 10. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved rule changes to allow the creation of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as,11 spot bitcoin ETF’s are expected to be launched this year.\n\nThe game-changing decision of the SEC will allow individuals, money managers and other financial institutions to get exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it. For a long time, the SEC was reluctant to approve the so-called spot bitcoin ETFs. However, the situation changed after the SEC lost a lawsuit to Grayscale in August 2023.\n\nFollowing the news, the price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped above the technical barrier of 47,000 to reach 47.893.70. However, Bitcoin price has since fallen sharply. On Jan 22, Bitcoin traded lower by nearly 3% at $39,854.61, hitting its lowest level since December 2023.\n\nNevertheless, bitcoin continues to hold a lot of potential. The SEC’s latest decision is likely to turn out to be a landmark, positioning the entire crypto space as an integral component of mainstream finance.\n\nTechnically, the Fed is set to initiate the first cut in interest rate in 2024 since March 2020, which saw the advent of the coronavirus pandemic. A lower interest rate regime should be very helpful for high-growth sectors like technology and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors.\n\nMoreover, the next Bitcoin Halving will occur in the first half of 2024. When a halving occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the NVDA stock usually soars on a booming crypto market. This is because GPUs are pivotal to data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 63.1% (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved 1.1% over the last 30 days. NVDA currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. COIN provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy in the United States and internationally. COIN offers the primary financial account in the crypto space for consumers, a marketplace with a pool of liquidity for transacting in crypto assets for institutions; and technology and services that enable developers to build crypto-based applications and securely accept crypto assets as payment.\n\nCoinbase Global has an expected earnings growth rate of 35.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 13.6% over the last 30 days. COIN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nBlock Inc. SQ is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants and is the parent company of Square and Cash App. The users of Cash App can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin. In addition, SQ’s decentralized tbd platform allows developers to build decentralized finance applications to run on programmable blockchains. SQ is also one of the largest Bitcoin investors.\n\nBlock has an expected earnings growth rate of 53.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 30 days. SQ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nRobinhood Markets Inc. HOOD operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 30 days. HOOD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nCME Group Inc.’s CME options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers Bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro-Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nCME Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 2.5% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last seven days.

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 5 Top Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Investing is a long-term game. You win by finding great companies and then buying and holding them. Your investment will grow in value as the underlying businesses grow.\n\nSo, how do you apply that mindset to technology stocks, where it's often a matter of disrupting your competition or being disrupted? It can be tricky, but there are bonafide winners with the size and fundamentals to continue thriving for years.\n\nHere are five of the very best companies in the tech sector. Consider adding these to a diversified portfolio, and you'll get richer while sleeping well at night.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a hot trend on Wall Street. Still, AI will likely grow and develop over the coming decades. Chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has quickly established itself as the chip kingpin of this new era. Its graphics processing chips specialize in demanding applications, and that natural fit catapulted the company to an estimated AI chip market share between 80% and 95%.\n\nIt's hard to see Nvidia completely losing that market share, even if competitors chip away at it over time. The companies investing in AI are spending billions of dollars, which could make it harder to get them to switch from what's already working. AI unlocked a new level of growth at Nvidia last year, but AI's long-term potential means that the stock should enjoy years of growth.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nModern technology is built on the cloud -- centralized servers and data centers that shift computing power off organizations' premises. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) might have built its reputation on e-commerce, but its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, is the world's leader. That makes the stock a no-brainer long-term buy and hold.\n\nToday, Amazon holds nearly a third of the global cloud platform market, meaning that most of your online web activity at least touches AWS at one point or another. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow by 20% annually through the decade's end, which will almost certainly trickle to AWS. Add in Amazon's other business units, and the future looks bright.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nData has arguably become the critical resource companies and governments crave in this modern world. Data helps companies know their customers, themselves, and their competitors. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has arguably the most data of any company on Earth thanks to its decades of dominance in Google Search and YouTube. These are the world's two most heavily trafficked sites.\n\nFor investors, Alphabet's massive audience gives it many billions of dollars in high-margin advertising revenue, which helped the company bring in over $77 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months alone. The company's data, deep pockets, and AI potential mean that Alphabet will likely leverage itself into years of growth ahead.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nSocial media has become a regular part of daily life for people worldwide, and nobody does it better than Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). The company owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, making money by showing ads to the 3.96 billion people using its apps monthly. The company's a cash cow, generating $37 billion in cash flow over the past year, and invests heavily into new opportunities, like AI and the metaverse via Reality Labs.\n\nStudies have shown that social media is addictive, which, admittedly, probably isn't great for its users' mental health but makes Meta Platforms' core business very sticky. While many of the world's largest companies are led by outsiders, Meta is still headed by its co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who is only 39. He's built the company into the tech giant it is today, so long-term investors should feel great about Meta's future.\n\n5. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCybersecurity has become one of the most critical pieces of any corporate budget. Getting hacked or suffering a data breach can cost a company millions in financial and reputational damage. CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) is part of a new generation of security companies, leaning on AI and cloud technology to provide security that learns in real-time, something legacy solutions like antivirus software can't match.\n\nCrowdStrike is by far the youngest company on this list, but it's established itself as a leader in its field. Notably, the business is already quite profitable despite still chasing revenue growth. More than 23,000 organizations use CrowdStrike, which sells its products in modules. Customers buy access to more modules as CrowdStrike expands its offerings, leading to durable growth from adding new customers and cross-selling to existing ones. Cybersecurity isn't going anywhere, making CrowdStrike a security leader to hold onto.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "AI Cheat Sheet: The 5 Most Popular Stock Picks (and Why)",
        "content": "If you got sick of all the artificial intelligence (AI) talk in 2023, you should know it probably won't lessen in 2024. With some saying AI and machine learning (ML) could be as transformational to business as the internet, it's best to roll with it. Especially because the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes AI will impact 40% of jobs globally.\n\nAI/ML is an expansive area, so it may be tough to know where to start. Just a few examples of the technology include:\n\nSpeech recognition (great for automobiles and drive-thru kiosks) Chatbots (terrific for online customer service and many other functions) Cybersecurity applications Virtual assistants Autonomous vehicles Factory robotics Medical research and diagnosis\n\nWhile the arena is massive, there are a few popular companies investors should know right off the bat. I'll start right at the top with heavyweights Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and then up-and-comers like Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) and UiPath(NYSE: PATH).\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia is among the most important companies because of its high-powered, essential data center hardware and software. Without Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and other products, AI applications would be difficult to execute. This has brought the company incredible success, which the infographic below depicts. NVDA INFOGRAPHIC\n\nFirst, we can see that total revenue increased 205% year over year (YOY) to $18 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 on the back of data center revenue, which increased 278% to $14.5 billion -- a ridiculous clip. Even more incredible, data center growth accelerated in Q3 of fiscal year 2024, eclipsing 171% in Q2.\n\nThe next major takeaway is the company's operating income (center of the graphic). It soared 1,633% to $10.4 billion on a 57% margin. Nvidia's profits skyrocketed because demand was higher than supply. They cannot produce enough to satisfy their customers, so they have pricing power.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has some challenges, like U.S. restrictions on exports to China and competition working hard; however, Nvidia creates new chips that meet export requirements to China, and it has a significant head start on competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\n\nTrading at 74 times earnings, the stock isn't cheap and likely won't be anytime soon. This drops to 46x on a forward basis (compared to Microsoft at 35x), which is more palatable. NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nWall Street has a history of underestimating Nvidia's future earnings. Still, be cautious at the current price or consider dollar-cost averaging.\n\nAlphabet\n\nIn late 2022, Alphabet found itself caught flat-footed when OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the stage, and Microsoft invested billions to bring the generative AI tech to Bing. Suddenly, there was serious competition for Google Search -- Alphabet's gravy train that produced $127 billion in revenue through Q3 2023, 57% of the company's total sales.\n\nLuckily, Alphabet has studied AI for years and has many solutions that have come out or are coming soon. There is Bard, Alphabet's answer to ChatGPT. Alphabet recently upgraded Bard with its Gemini tech to enhance its performance.\n\nGoogle Search has new features that allow users to search with a picture, optimize translation services, and provide more relevant results. The company developed its own chip, the tensor processing unit (TPU), for generative AI applications. Perhaps the ChatGPT release was the kick in the pants Alphabet needed to get its AI program to the market.\n\nAlphabet's sales are up 7% YOY through Q3 2023 to $221 billion; however, growth accelerated to 11% in the last quarter. More impressively, cash from operations is up 22% this year, reaching $83 billion to show that Alphabet is still a cash-flow machine. The stock is fairly valued, trading close to its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon is among the most exciting AI companies because it benefits from AI on multiple fronts. Generative AI software requires massive data processing, much of which runs through the cloud. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest provider of cloud services. Growth at AWS slowed in 2023 because companies cut their data usage budgets in anticipation of a recession, but AI and increased budgets could turn this around in 2024.\n\nThe company also uses AI in digital advertising and logistics, and Amazon Bedrock provides foundational models for companies to tailor AI applications to their needs.\n\nWhile AWS growth slowed in 2023, areas like digital advertising thrived, and Amazon grew total revenue by 11% through Q3 2023 to $405 billion. Positive free cash flow and net income also returned after a difficult 2022.\n\nThe stock trades well below its recent averages based on operating cash flow and sales, as shown below. AMZN PS Ratio data by YCharts. CFO = cash flow from operations. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio.\n\nThe valuation and opportunity make Amazon stock an alluring buy.\n\nPalantir\n\nPalantir has been unapologetically hyping its AI prowess since before AI was the thing to be. The company helps governments and businesses manage, analyze, visualize, and act on data. It also provides a platform where clients can build and deploy applications, and its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software expands on this by using AI to enhance logical decision-making.\n\nPalantir is a critical partner in the defense industry and is making strides in the private sector. Last quarter, private sector sales increased 23% YOY to $251 million, while government sales grew 12% to $308 million. Palantir also achieved its fourth straight quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits, has $3.3 billion in cash and investments, and has no long-term debt. It's no wonder it's a popular stock. Still, its 17% YOY growth last quarter may not justify its current valuation of 17x sales.\n\nUiPath\n\nUiPath is getting some well-deserved attention lately. The company is a leader in robotic process automation (RPA). RPA has many use cases that get to the heart of AI/ML: efficiency.\n\nFor instance, picture a large company that receives hundreds of invoices daily through email. Instead of manually downloading and inputting them (as is the case now), RPA does this automatically with minimal human intervention. This is why UiPath reported $1.4 billion annual recurring revenue on 24% growth and over 10,800 customers last quarter.\n\nThere is intense industry competition, namely from Microsoft, which gives investors pause. However, the company is on firm financial footing, reporting $1.75 billion in cash and investments with no long-term debt, and trades for just 10x sales. This makes UiPath a very compelling stock for growth-oriented investors.\n\nMany terrific companies are doing innovative things in AI. Of these popular companies, I think Amazon and UiPath are the most intriguing buys based on potential and valuation; however, each name has a lot to like.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Q3 Earnings Roundup: Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) And The Rest Of The Semiconductors Segment\n\nAs Q3 earnings season comes to a close, it’s time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers amongst the semiconductors stocks, including Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and its peers.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is driven by cyclical demand for advanced electronic products like smartphones, PCs, servers, and data storage. While analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment, processors (CPUs) and graphics chips serve as their brains. The growth of data and technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, and smart cars are creating the next wave of secular growth for the industry.\n\nThe 41 semiconductors stocks we track reported a mixed Q3; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 0.8% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 4.1% below consensus. Stocks have been under pressure as inflation (despite slowing) makes their long-dated profits less valuable, but semiconductors stocks held their ground better than others, with the share prices up 26.3% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)\n\nFounded in 1970 by a Motorola employee, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) is a leading producer of hard disk drives, SSDs and flash memory.\n\nWestern Digital reported revenues of $2.75 billion, down 26.4% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 3.3%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' EPS estimates but a decline in its operating margin.\n\n“Western Digital’s fiscal first quarter results exceeded our expectations as the team’s efforts to bolster business agility and develop differentiated and innovative products across a broad range of end-markets have resulted in sequential margin improvement across flash and HDD businesses,” said David Goeckeler, Western Digital CEO. Western Digital Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is up 49.3% since the results and currently trades at $58.\n\nIs now the time to buy Western Digital?

It was a stunning quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin and an impressive beat of analysts' EPS estimates. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia scored the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is up 14.9% since the results and currently trades at $574.4.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia?

It was a weak quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a miss of analysts' revenue estimates.\n\nThe stock is up 9.4% since the results and currently trades at $82.25.\n\nRead our full analysis of Power Integrations's results here.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS)\n\nResult of a merger of Alpha Industries and the wireless communications division of Conexant, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) is a designer and manufacturer of chips used in smartphones, autos, and industrial applications to amplify, filter, and process wireless signals.\n\nSkyworks Solutions reported revenues of $1.22 billion, down 13.4% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a weaker quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its gross margin.\n\nThe stock is up 19% since the results and currently trades at $106.5.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Skyworks Solutions here, it's free.\n\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)\n\nFormed by the 1997 merger of the two leading semiconductor yield management companies, KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is the leading supplier of equipment used to measure and inspect semiconductor chips.\n\nKLA Corporation reported revenues of $2.40 billion, down 12% year on year, surpassing analyst expectations by 1.9%.

        "title": "My Top 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Now in 2024 and Hold Long Term",
        "content": "Grand View Research estimates that spending across artificial intelligence (AI) hardware, software, and services will compound at 37% annually through 2030. That creates a significant opportunity for investors. Businesses are racing to improve productivity with predictive insights and automation, and that secular trend should drive many stocks higher in 2024 and beyond.\n\nThe most prudent way to capitalize on that trend is to build a basket of AI stocks. Here's why now is a good time to add shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG) to that basket.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in running complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The company has regularly achieved top scores at the MLPerf benchmarks, the industry standard in benchmarking the performance of machine learning (ML) hardware, software, and services across training and inference use cases. And Nvidia holds more than 80% market share in AI/ML chips, according to analysts.\n\nHowever, the company is truly formidable because of its full-stack strategy. To elaborate, Nvidia has extended its data center hardware portfolio to include networking equipment and central processing units (CPUs) purpose-built for AI, and both have become multibillion-dollar businesses. The company has also branched into subscription software and cloud services to simplify the development of AI applications, and those products have become a billion-dollar business.\n\nManagement sees those three adjacencies -- networking, CPUs, and software and services -- as key growth drivers because they extend its ability to monetize AI. Additionally, with products addressing every layer of the AI stack -- infrastructure, software, and services -- Nvidia is an even more compelling option for businesses. To that end, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino believes its \"full-stack AI/software capabilities provide an incredible competitive advantage.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGrand View Research expects the GPU market to grow roughly 28% annually through 2030. When coupled with growth in other AI spending categories, that tailwind could translate into annual sales growth above 25% for Nvidia, which makes its current valuation of 30.9 times sales seem tolerable.\n\nAs a caveat, that multiple is a premium to the three-year average of 23.5 times sales, but investors with a five-year time horizon should still consider buying a small position today. Nvidia will probably command a premium valuation for the foreseeable future.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe, and it has become the third-largest ad tech company in the world. The company is using AI to make both businesses more efficient and profitable. For instance, Amazon uses ML models to optimize inventory and logistics routes, and it recently launched a generative AI tool that helps brands create marketing content.\n\nHowever, Amazon is truly primed to monetize AI because it has a dominant position in cloud computing. Indeed, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for 32% of cloud infrastructure and platform services in the most recent quarter, while its closest competitor, Microsoft Azure, held 23% market share. That means AWS is arguably the cloud provider best positioned to support businesses as they experiment with AI, and its status as a leader in cloud AI developer services makes that argument even more credible.\n\nAdditionally, AWS has launched new generative AI products. Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service that supports the development of generative AI applications. And Code Whisperer is an AI-enabled copilot for software developers. The company also announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant that can automate tasks and surface insights across a range of systems and data sources, including external products from Microsoft and Salesforce.\n\nWith that in mind, Morningstar analysts expect Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually through 2027, driven by particularly strong momentum in digital advertising and cloud computing. That estimate makes its current valuation of 2.8 times sales seem fair, especially when the three-year average is 3 times sales.\n\n3. Datadog\n\nDatadog provides observability and cybersecurity software that helps businesses monitor IT infrastructure and resolve performance issues. Its platform leans on AI to surface insights, detect anomalies, and automate root cause analysis. Datadog is a recognized leader in several software verticals, including application performance monitoring, log monitoring, and AI for IT operations.\n\nObservability software becomes increasingly essential as IT environments become more complex. That means digital transformation projects, like cloud migration and AI deployment, are tailwinds for Datadog. But the company has further cemented its ability to monetize AI with two new products.\n\nFirst, LLM Observability is a performance monitoring solution for generative AI applications and the underlying large language models. Second, Bits AI is a conversational copilot that helps development and operations teams investigate and resolve problems more quickly.\n\nDatadog expects its addressable market to increase at 11% annually to reach $62 billion in 2026, but the company should grow much faster. In fact, Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin believes Datadog could become the \"fastest growing software company\" as the generative AI boom unfolds, and the Wall Street consensus calls for sales to increase at 26% annually over the next five years. That outlook makes its current valuation of 20.6 times sales seem reasonable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "18 High Growth Low PE Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the18 High Growth Low PE Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 High Growth Low PE Stocks.\n\nWhen value stocks came back with a vengeance in 2022, value investors cheered what they thought was the beginning of a long bull run of value stocks. But thanks to the AI boom, growth stocks rebounded in 2023. In a ten-year period ending 2021, the Russell Growth 1000 Index doubled the performance of the Russell 1000 Value Index. The so-called 'value investing' strategy has taken a hit amid an unending growth of technology stocks. But over the years the traditional boundaries between value and growth investing have faded. In fact, successful investors like Warren Buffett have long been saying that differentiating between value and growth does not make sense as they see growth a part of the broader value investing philosophy. Warren Buffett once said:\n\n\"There is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks as Wall Street generally portrays them, as contrasting asset classes. Growth is part of the value equation.”\n\nThere was a time Buffett stayed away from tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) saying he did not understand business models of these companies. But today he has huge stakes in some of the top tech companies in the US.\n\nRelying totally on PE ratios without paying attention to fundamentals and growth of companies is also not useful. For example, Oakmark in its September 2023 report on Value Vs Growth said the following which shows the importance of paying attention to both value multiples and growth metrics before making investment decisions:\n\n\"When we compare the 50 lowest ranked companies by P/E ratio on the S&P 500 today to the ones that made that list in previous periods, we don’t observe any decline in business quality. Therefore, considering both the relatively high price of the higher P/E companies and the solid business quality of the lower P/E companies—we believe that low P/E stocks today present a better hunting ground than they normally do. Last year we bought depressed stocks of high- growth businesses, such as Uber, at a double-digit free cash flow yield; Workday at a low price relative to sales; and Adobe at only a slightly higher than average P/E ratio. This year, after strong outperformance, we sold them and bought much lower P/E stocks. Here’s a fun way to think of it: In 2022, we bought a share of Adobe for about three shares of CVS Health. (CVS was just under $100 and Adobe under $300). This year we sold Adobe to buy more than six shares of CVS. (Adobe increased to well over $400 and CVS fell to $70.) We thought Adobe was cheap when we bought it, despite it being a high-growth business, and that CVS was fully priced when we sold it, despite it having a below-average P/E ratio.\"\n\nStory continues High Growth Low PE Stocks\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with PE ratios less than 15 and high revenue growth (over 25%) over the past five years and also in the most recent quarters.

        "title": "Could Super Micro Computer Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), more commonly known as Supermicro, has likely made enormous profits for investors over the years. The producer of high-performance servers went public at $8 on March 29, 2007, and it now trades at about $423.\n\nA $20,000 investment in Supermicro stock at the time of its IPO would be worth $1.06 million today. The lion's share of those gains, however, occurred within the past couple of years.\n\nSupermicro's growth was driven by robust sales of its high-end servers, and those sales have accelerated as the artificial intelligence (AI) market expanded. Its close partnership with Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) also granted it access to the chipmaker's top-tier server GPUs before Supermicro's larger competitors, and the company carved out a high-growth niche in the saturated server market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut even after its massive rally in 2022 and 2023, Supermicro still has a modest enterprise value of $23 billion and looks reasonably valued at 21 times next year's expected earnings. So could this hot AI stock turn a fresh $20,000 investment into more than $1 million again?\n\nHow fast is Supermicro growing?\n\nFrom its fiscal 2007 through its fiscal 2021 (which ended in June 2021), Supermicro's revenue grew at a compound annual rate of 16%. That fairly stable growth was driven by the expansion of the cloud, data center, edge computing, 5G, and AI markets.\n\nHowever, the development of new generative AI platforms lit a fire under Supermicro's business. The company's revenue surged by 46% in fiscal 2022 and 37% in fiscal 2023, and analysts expect 61% growth in fiscal 2024.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Supermicro's revenue to rise at a compound annual rate of 26%. That growth should be driven by three catalysts: its partnership with Nvidia, market share gains in AI servers, and the expansion of the generative AI market -- which Fortune Business Insights forecasts will grow at a compound annual rate of 48% from 2022 to 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe mathematical path to $1 million\n\nIf Supermicro's valuations hold steady, the company would need to grow revenue at a compound annual rate of 17% for 25 years to turn a $20,000 investment into $1 million. That goal seems achievable relative to its past growth, but the company could face three major challenges.\n\nFirst, Supermicro still controls a much smaller slice of the pre-built server market than Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) or Dell(NYSE: DELL). Both of those larger competitors could strike back at Supermicro with new AI servers, sign similar deals with Nvidia, and lure away its potential customers with cheaper hardware.\n\nSecond, the AI market could cool after the buying frenzy in AI chips and servers over the past two years. That would be bad news for Supermicro, which now generates about half of its revenue from its dedicated AI servers. If that core growth engine slows, its stock could be revalued to reflect a view of the company as a legacy server maker instead of a hot AI stock.\n\nHPE and Dell, which are both growing slower than Supermicro, trade at 8 and 12 times forward earnings, respectively. If investors decide that Supermicro belongs in the same basket as those two older server makers, its stock price could be cut in half.\n\nLastly, we can expect that a few recessions will occur over the next 25 years. Large companies will inevitably rein in spending on big AI upgrades during those downturns -- and as the underdog, Supermicro could struggle more than HPE and Dell under those market conditions.\n\nIt's a good long-term play on the AI market\n\nSupermicro should keep growing, but it's quickly becoming an all-in bet on the AI market. If the company can maintain its tight partnership with Nvidia and continue to grow its share of the nascent AI server market, then it could still be a millionaire-maker stock. But it could be a bumpy ride -- and investors should keep a close eye on Supermicro's competition and rising valuations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Help Make You a Fortune",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is expected to supercharge multiple industries in the long run, with Bloomberg Intelligence estimating that this market could go on to generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in annual revenue in 2032, as compared to just $40 billion in 2022.\n\nNot surprisingly, investors have been buying companies capable of winning big from the proliferation of AI in the long run. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Cloudflare(NYSE: NET) are two companies that fall in this category. While Nvidia is playing a central role in driving the AI revolution with its powerful chips, Cloudflare's internet infrastructure services also will play an important factor in the adoption of this technology.\n\nLet's see how AI could help these companies clock outstanding growth in the long run and make a fortune for investors at the same time.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is one of the first names that may come to mind if you are looking to buy an AI stock. That's not surprising, considering how this technology has led to a sharp jump in the company's revenue and earnings.\n\nNvidia's revenue in the current fiscal year is on track to more than double to $59 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings are expected to jump significantly over the next three fiscal years, as compared to fiscal 2023 earnings of $3.34 per share. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs the chart shows, Nvidia's bottom line could jump 7-fold in just three years. Such terrific growth can be attributed to its immense pricing power and robust share of the AI chip market. For example, Nvidia's flagship H100 AI graphics processing unit (GPU) -- which is in hot demand and reportedly commands a waiting period between 36 and 52 weeks -- reportedly costs $3,320 to manufacture, according to investment bank Raymond James.\n\nNvidia reportedly sells each H100 processor at an average price of $30,000, commanding a huge profit on each unit of this AI chip. Given that Nvidia is expected to sell 2 million units of this chip in 2024, it could generate $60 billion in revenue from sales of this single processor this year. And given the potential margin that it enjoys on the sale of each H100, it should be able to generate a sizable profit from the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is bringing new chips to the market as well, such as the H200. This will be a successor to the H100 and is expected to go on sale this year. Given that the H200 will be more powerful than Nvidia's current flagship, the company could price it higher and generate a bigger profit. Moreover, with Nvidia controlling more than 85% of the AI chip market, it is in a solid position to capitalize on this lucrative space that's expected to generate $400 billion in revenue in 2027, as compared to $45 billion in 2023.\n\nAs a result, don't be surprised to see Nvidia's earnings actually jumping to $24 per share in fiscal 2026. If we multiply the projected fiscal 2026 earnings with Nvidia's five-year average earnings multiple of 42, its stock price could jump to just over $1,000 per share over the next couple of years. That points to 75% gains from current levels.\n\nWith shares of Nvidia trading at just 27 times forward earnings right now -- a discount to the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 29 -- investors are getting a good deal on this AI stock, considering the healthy gains it could deliver.\n\n2. Cloudflare\n\nWhile Nvidia is a top pick to take advantage of growing investments in AI hardware, Cloudflare presents a different kind of opportunity to capitalize on this market. Cloudflare is a provider of cloud-based internet infrastructure services that help improve the performance, reliability, and security of internet connections.\n\nOpenAI turned to Cloudflare at the end of 2022 when its chatbot -- ChatGPT -- exploded in popularity. The AI start-up adopted Cloudflare's bot management solutions, distributed denial of service (DDoS), and content delivery network (CDN) to manage the huge load on its network and keep fraudulent users at bay.\n\nThe good part is that Cloudflare has been winning more AI-related contracts from customers who are looking to securely collect AI and machine learning data and maintain privacy at the same time. What's more, Cloudflare has set its sights on a lucrative AI niche that could unlock a new growth opportunity for the company in the long run.\n\nCloudflare is aggressively rolling out a cloud-based AI inference platform across the globe. The company deployed graphics cards meant for AI inference in 100 cities by the end of 2023. By the end of this year, management expects to \"have inference-optimized GPUs running in nearly every location where Cloudflare operates worldwide, making us easily the most widely distributed cloud-AI inference platform.\"\n\nThe company operates data centers in 300 cities globally, and it has been deploying GPUs from Nvidia in these locations to capitalize on the potential boom in AI inference applications. Cloudflare points out that the availability of Nvidia's powerful GPUs and AI software on its cloud platform will allow customers to run large language models (LLMs) in a cost-effective manner, as they won't have to spend huge amounts of money on hardware.\n\nSuch a catalyst explains why Cloudflare is anticipated to maintain impressive revenue growth. NET Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nWhat's more, analysts are expecting its earnings to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years. Using Cloudflare's 2023 earnings estimate of $0.46 as the base, its bottom line could jump to $5.13 per share at the end of 2028.\n\nIf we use the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 29 as a benchmark for tech stocks and expect Cloudflare to sport a similar multiple after five years, its stock price could jump to $149. That would be a 91% increase from current levels, which is why investors may want to consider buying this AI winner before it moves higher following 68% gains in the past year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks are increasingly coming into focus for growth investors looking to amplify their returns.\n\nIndeed, looking at Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) performance on a year-to-date (YTD) basis (and really over almost any time frame), it’s clear that investors are focusing on long-term growth trends for the coming decade. As data usage grows, the demand for computing power will exponentially rise. Accordingly, Nvidia has become the focal point of most investors’ chip exposure.\n\nAnd yet, investors should consider plenty of other semiconductor stocks, given the potential market size. Estimates include a projected market value of $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, other stocks look poised to provide big returns over time. Given the rise of AI, machine learning, and quantum computing, check out these stocks that are set to see gains.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been hot lately, with its stock similarly surging to all-time highs. Investors who seek the “next Nvidia” find promise in AMD as a compelling alternative. The company has a strong market position and a new AI GPU challenging Nvidia.\n\nLaunched in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT reshaped perceptions of AI capabilities. Nvidia dominated as the main chip supplier to this endeavor and others. In fact, it underscored AMD’s lag in the AI race.\n\nHowever, AMD has since responded with the MI300X AI GPU, on par with Nvidia’s H100 for training and 10% to 20% superior for inference. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) partnerships further bolster AMD’s AI future.\n\nDespite hitting a $160 high and a 127% increase over the last year, AMD’s potential ascent extends into 2024. The company’s Q3 revenue came in at $5.8 billion, up 4% year over year (YOY), suggesting a continuing positive trend. Now, AMD is looking at record revenue. While not mirroring Nvidia’s rally, AMD’s appeal to top tech firms positions it well for significant market share gains over the long-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn January 18, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) surpassed Q4 earnings estimates, reporting $1.44 per U.S. share on $19.62 billion in sales. Despite four consecutive quarters of declining revenue, TSM anticipates a return to growth this quarter, overcoming challenges in smartphone and automobile chip demand.\n\nIn Q1, TSMC anticipates revenue between $18 billion and $18.8 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s $18.27 billion target. The company’s Q4 success was driven by the robust 3-nanometer technology ramp-up. CFO Wendell Huang expects Q1 impact from smartphone seasonality, balanced by sustained high-performance computing demand.\n\nThe chipmaker projects 2024 revenue to surge more than 20% due to high demand for AI-centric high-end chips. Needham analyst Charles Shi noted TSMC’s outlook slightly exceeds Wall Street expectations. This suggests a prolonged downturn and a slower-than-normal cycle recovery in 2024. Also, it makes TMC stock a semiconductor option worth considering right now.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology’s (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares surged 5.7% following TMC’s robust Q4 earnings results. It really provided a rising tide that lifted all boats (AMD also surged following these impressive forward forecasts). Despite not being a leader in terms of semiconductor stocks, Marvell Technology has nearly doubled from its 52-week low. And, it continues to provide plenty of strong upward momentum for investors.\n\nMRVL is an outside option in the chip race, with higher potential upside. Indeed, if one takes the view that this entire sector should get a boost from surging chip sales, MRVL could have greater upside than its mega-cap counterparts. Investors and traders will want to look for higher-beta ways to play this trade. The company certainly looks intriguing in this right.\n\nAlso, Marvell Technology trades at a higher discount to its peers, with a more attractive valuation multiple.

        "title": "Nvidia's rivals are circling, but they're still years from catching up",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is the AI king. Its share of the global AI chip market is estimated at anywhere between 70% and 90%. Its high-powered graphics processors, which are perfect for training AI models and putting them to work, are in such demand that getting them is a task all its own.\n\nIn June, with the AI craze in full swing, Nvidia’s market cap eclipsed the $1 trillion mark. And on Friday, shares of the company hit an all-time high of $549.91.\n\nIt’s not just Nvidia’s hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The company’s Cuda software, which developers use to create AI platforms, is just as important to Nvidia’s staying power.\n\n“Software continues to be Nvidia's strategic moat,” explained Gartner VP analyst Chirag Dekate. “These ... turnkey experiences enable Nvidia to be at the forefront of mindshare, as well as adoption.”\n\nNvidia’s lead didn’t happen overnight. It’s been working on AI products for years, even as investors questioned the move.\n\n“Nvidia, to its credit, started about 15 years ago working with universities to find novel things that you could do with GPUs, aside from gaming and visualization,” explained Moor Insights & Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead.\n\n“What Nvidia does is they help create markets and that puts competitors in a very tough situation out there, because by the time they've caught up, Nvidia is on to the next new thing,” he added. Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the Hon Hai Tech Day in Taipei on Oct. 18, 2023. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nBut threats to Nvidia’s reign are rising. Rivals Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) are marshaling their forces to grab their own slice of the AI pie. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s own data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nIt’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Meta (META), are increasingly turning to their own chips in the form of what are known as ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits.\n\nStory continues\n\nThink of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it.\n\nASICs, on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. They’re built specifically for a company’s own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\n\nThat’s a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as hyperscalers focus more on their own ASICs, they may have less of a need for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThat said, on the whole Nvidia’s technology is well ahead of its competitors.\n\n“They have a ... long-term research pipeline to continue driving the future of GPU leadership,” Dekate explained. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind when it comes to AI chips is how they’re used. The first way is training models, which is called, well, training. The second is putting those models into practice so that people can use them to do things like generate a specific output you want, whether that’s in the form of a text, images, or something else entirely. That’s called inferencing.\n\nOpenAI has inferences of ChatGPT, while Microsoft has inferences of Copilot. And every time you send a request to either program, they take advantage of AI accelerators to generate the text or image you want.\n\nOver time, inferencing is likely to become the primary use case for AI chips as more companies seek to take advantage of different AI models.\n\nStill, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. So even if Nvidia’s market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Fell Today",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are all the rage with investors these days -- and how can you blame them for their enthusiasm after Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the poster child for the AI revolution, more than tripled in price in 2023? Now that the calendar has flipped to 2024, investors are looking for \"the next Nvidia,\" and a lot of them appear to be betting that it will be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which just announced its MI300X line of accelerator chips.\n\nNot so fast, said Northland Capital on Monday, when it downgraded AMD to \"market perform.\" The stock promptly fell, and was trading down 3.6% as of 2:25 p.m. ET.\n\nRational or irrational exuberance?\n\nWith Nvidia stock up more than 200% over the past 52 weeks -- including more than 20% in 2024 alone -- but AMD up \"only\" 127%, most investors still seem to agree that the next Nvidia is actually going to be Nvidia. Still, hope springs eternal, and AMD stock has definitely caught a tailwind from its rival's success.\n\nHowever, for those hoping to repeat the success they had investing in Nvidia last year by buying AMD stock this year, Northland has some cautionary advice: The AI revolution is going to be \"really big, just not as big as investors are thinking.\"\n\nIn 2023, you see, amid a mad scramble by companies to get ahold of all the high-powered chips they might need, many bought more than they actually did need. This means that the boom in AI chip demand that began in 2023 might not keep accelerating as fast as investors think. Instead, buying might pause or even retrace a bit as companies digest the inventory they acquired in 2023.\n\nAs such, predictions about where that segment of the chip market is headed are showing an interesting divergence: TipRanks recently reported a Melius Research prediction that by 2025, AMD's data center revenue will tip the scales at an incredible $15.5 billion, up from about $6 billion in 2023. Northland, however, thinks it might take until 2027 for AMD to pass the $16 billion mark on AI revenue, as StreetInsider.com reported Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs AMD stock a sell?\n\nMind you, $16 billion is a big number, and nearly three times last year's data center revenue for AMD. Northland also does still believe that AMD will get there eventually. It's just that, with AMD stock now valued at a staggering 1,580 times trailing earnings and changing hands for more than twice what it cost a year ago, the analyst believes that a lot of the potential for AMD has already been priced into the stock -- and it's time now for investors to take a breather, count their winnings, and see if things play out as well as they hoped.\n\nThat sounds like good advice to me. And with AMD due to report earnings just a week from now, on Jan. 29, this seems like a really good time to pause and wait to see how the numbers look before buying any more AMD stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 22, 2024\n\nRich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy for a Strong Start to 2024",
        "content": "After a sluggish New Year start, the stock market is again rallying. The benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq100 each hit new all-time highs on Jan. 19. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has been hitting successive new PRs since December of last year.\n\nThe new records have been reached thanks, in large part, to the continued rally in technology stocks. Specifically, the stocks of microchips and semiconductor companies tied to artificial intelligence (AI) have been leading the market higher. While impressive, chip stocks aren’t the only game in town.\n\nBeyond tech, other stocks worth owning, many of which are undervalued and available to buy on the cheap right now. So, let’s delve into three such stocks to buy to start your year off strong.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRestaurant Brands International (QSR) A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.\n\nSource: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the revival of the Burger King chain, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) looks promising for 2024. Additionally, the company owns Popeyes, Firehouse Subs and the Tim Hortons coffee and doughnut chain.\n\nToday, Restaurant Brands International is the fifth-largest operator of fast food restaurants worldwide. In recent years, its focus and resources have largely gone to reviving the BK chain that has fallen behind McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and other competitors.\n\nRecently, QSR announced that it is taking full control of Carrols Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:TAST). The $1 billion deal is with its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee. Carrols operates more than 1,000 Burger King restaurants and 60 Popeyes locations across America. Currently, Restaurant Brands owns 15% of Carrols and is now taking full control. The company is moving away from larger franchisees, such as Carrols, in favor of local franchisees as part of its turnaround strategy.\n\nPreviously, QSR announced its investment of $500 million to remodel 600 of Carrols’ Burger King outlets. The stock has gained 15% in the last year and pays a quarterly dividend of 55 cents a share, giving it a yield of 2.86%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFedEx (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors shouldn’t give up on shipping and logistics giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX). Company executives haven’t.\n\nFedEx’s new chief financial officer (CFO) John Dietrich has been buying up the company’s stock lately. The share price dropped following the most recent earnings print in December. Dietrich, who became the CFO on Aug. 1 of last year, paid $252,000 on Dec. 28 for 1,000 shares of FDX stock at an average price of $252.02 each.\n\nAccording to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dietrich now owns 4,745 shares of FDX stock worth $1.16 million. Dietrich, previous CEO of private aviation firm Atlas Air Worldwide, began buying FedEx shares after the company reported disappointing earnings on Dec. 19, sending the stock down 12% in a single trading session. The shares have been trading sideways to start 2024. This presents a buying opportunity for investors.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors looking for a microchip and semiconductor stock to play the artificial intelligence (AI) trade might want to look at Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The stock has been rising along with the entire chip sector, but not as fast as many other semiconductor securities. Year to date (YTD), MU is up 6% and gained 50% in the past 12 months. Compare that to the 26% YTD gain in the stock of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), whose share price is now up 150% in the last 12 months.\n\nMU stock has been on an upswing since the company reported earnings right before Christmas that beat Wall Street forecasts. The still unprofitable Micron announced a loss of 95 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, which was better than a loss of $1.01 that was expected. Revenue totaled $4.73 billion, which topped consensus forecasts of $4.58 billion. Micron is a leader in dynamic random-access memory chips often used in desktop computers and servers, and flash memory found in hard drives.\n\nThe company gave a bullish outlook for artificial intelligence (AI), saying on its earnings call that generative AI would drive “multiyear growth” at the company. Additionally, MU said that inventory levels for its memory and storage chips are at normal levels. In fact, it is working with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on some upcoming AI chips. All are good reasons to buy MU stock to get a strong start to 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Some investors embark on the roads less traveled instead of sticking with reliable, mature corporations that have been around for decades. While blue-chip stocks have their place in many portfolios, investors can generate exceptional returns from high-potential stocks that have yet to mature.\n\nA mature company is a firm that has been posting low-single-digit revenue and earnings growth over several years. Those firms have exhausted most of their runways and have limited growth opportunities — other than making acquisitions.\n\nThese revolutionary stocks break from that pattern and appear on the brink of growth. Investors may want to consider these high-growth potential stocks for outsized returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Automated stock trading concept. Robotic hand analyzing financial data on stock exchange, artificial intelligence utilization to predict precise price change in stock market. Trailblazing. trillion-dollar ai stocks\n\nSource: Owlie Productions / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been a top artificial intelligence (AI) stock for several years but its smaller market cap makes it less known than giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThe company’s AI servers are in high demand. That hasn’t been a secret to long-term investors. SMCI stock gained 474% over the past year and soared by 2,732% over the past five years. Despite the significant growth, SMCI only has a $24 billion market cap. The company has plenty of room to run.\n\nSuper Micro offered new guidance that revealed significant growth for the company’s IT solutions. The updated guidance forecasts revenue more than doubling year-over-year (YoY). The range is $3.60 to $3.65 billion in sales. The firm’s previous guidance was $2.7 to $2.9 billion.\n\nThe company is also forecasting substantial GAAP EPS growth, now forecasted to reach $4.90 to $5.05 per share. Assuming Super Micro reports $5 EPS and holds onto that number for the entire year, it’s trading at a forward P/E ratio in the low 20s.\n\nIts strong guidance reminds me of when Nvidia raised guidance and impressed investors in 2023. The development makes Super Micro a candidate to outperform Nvidia in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) has a long history of rewarding investors with stable profits and healthy revenue growth. Shares are up by 314% over the past five years. However, the stock hit a speed bump in August. The company’s stock dropped by 25% on August 4th after a disappointing earnings report.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm slightly trimmed its guidance. That was enough to send the stock spiraling. Fortinet faces short-term headwinds that should give way to growth later in the year. Even now, revenue and earnings growth aren’t terrible. Revenue increased by 16% YoY, while net income increased by 39.4% YoY in the third quarter.\n\nNet income growth was fine, but investors are used to seeing revenue growth above 30%. Furthermore, billings only increased by 6% YoY, indicating the company is not yet out of the woods.\n\nYou’ll have to be patient with this cybersecurity stock. However, it’s one of the few companies with a reasonable valuation that doesn’t depend on rapid earnings growth acceleration. Shares trade at a 43 P/E ratio and a 37 forward P/E ratio.\n\nThe company has healthy free cash flow and has been repurchasing shares to elevate the stock price. Fortinet has been reliable for many years and can be on the brink of a new breakout once the firm indicates growth is returning.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe language learning mobile app and brand offer significant upside for long-term investors. The stock’s valuation remains a concern as the forward P/E is above 100. The firm has been reporting 40%+ YoY revenue growth for several quarters and continued the trend in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring that quarter, revenue increased by 43% YoY. Investors should expect elevated revenue growth to continue as the company also reported a 63% growth in daily active users and a 49% YoY increase in total bookings. Most of the company’s bookings are subscriptions, and that segment increased by 54% year-over-year.\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) helps people learn new languages and has expanded into other subjects like math and music. Shares have gained 125% over the past year but endured a sharp 19% correction over the past month. The firm recently became profitable, and expanding margins should improve the valuation. Further drops will make the buying opportunity more enticing.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SMCI, FTNT and DUOL.

        "title": "The Market Isn't Following the Classic January Script",
        "content": "January so far is unfolding far differently than the stock market playbook suggests.\n\nWhen people talk about the January effect in the stock market, they are referring to any of four separate but overlapping things.\n\nThe overall market tends to rise in January. Small stocks usually beat big ones. Last year's disasters often come roaring back. The month of January allegedly predicts the full year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with PFE.\n\nSo far this year, the market isn't following the classic playbook. Through Jan. 19, the market was indeed up, but barely. Stocks have gained 1.54% as measured by the most widely used gauge, the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.56%.\n\nSmall stocks aren't performing as they're supposed to. The Russell 2000 Index of small stocks was down 4.05%, even after including dividends.\n\nMissing rebound\n\nWhat about last year's big losers? Normally, they would rebound. For tax reasons, people often sell losers in November and December, recording losses they can use to offset gains elsewhere. Some of these tax-loss punching bags get pushed down below their inherent value. Normally, they bounce in January.\n\nBut this year, the January rebound is missing.\n\nAs a sample of last year's losers, I chose 10 stocks that were down 8% to 50% in 2023. They included such well-known names as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), as well as some lesser-known names.\n\nEight of these 10 losers were down 30% or more in 2023, and six were down 40% or more. By contrast, the S&P 500 was up more than 26% last year, including dividends. From such severe underperformance, I expected to see a rebound, at least what Wall Street calls a dead cat bounce.\n\nIt hasn't happened. Eight of the 10 losers in my sample have kept right on falling. As a group, the 10 are down 6.04% through Jan. 19, rubbing salt in the wound of last year's losses.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nTo understand why January is not following the normal playbook, it helps to look at the anatomy of this January's advance. I used Guru Focus software to run some diagnostic x-rays.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are 35 U.S. stocks with a market value of $200 billion or more. Through Jan. 19, their median gain is 2.9%.\n\nBy contrast, if we look at a sample of mid-sized stocks, the median return so far this year is a loss of 1.45%. And if we look at small stocks, it's a loss of 3.3%.\n\nThat shows this year's market advance is due entirely to the big boys. Stocks like Microsoft Corp. ((NASDAQ:MSFT), up 6%), Alphabet Inc. ((NASDAQ:GOOGL), up 4.8%) and Nvidia Corp. ((NASDAQ:NVDA), up 20.1%) have a big weight in the S&P 500, and push market indices up, even as the typical stock goes nowhere.\n\nIt's also revealing to slice things up by market sectors. In health care, the median stock is down 1.35%. Real estate stocks are down 2.16%, even after dividends are included. In the industrial sector, the typical loss is 2.61%.\n\nPeople say that this is a tech-driven market, but wait a minute. The median technology stock is down 1.85%. So it's big tech that's driving the bus, not all tech.\n\nThe barometer\n\nA final bit of January lore is the notion that January predicts the full year. But data throw cold water on this idea.\n\nI've studied the accuracy of the so-called January Barometer over 74 years, from 1950 to the present. In the simplest form, the barometer has been correct 73% of the time.\n\nSound pretty good? It's not, because a naive forecasting model, which simply declares that every year will be an up year, is correct 77% of the time.\n\nThen, too, January is part of the year it is supposed to predict. If you remove that head start factor and make January predict the next 11 months, the barometer works only 68% of the time.\n\nFinally, the barometer does very poorly as a warning system. When January is down, the full year is still up in most cases. The accuracy rate for down Januaries is only 43%, or 41% is the head-start factor is removed.\n\nThere are still several days to go this month, so we'll see whether January is an up month or a down month. Either way, don't put too much faith in what it tells you.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston.

        "content": "As part of Yahoo Finance's AI Revolution week, Radio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook for generative AI adoption and corporate valuations. He argues \"we are no closer to superintelligence, I would believe, than we were 10 years ago,\" despite perceptions of AI models becoming more \"superintelligent.\"\n\nWindsor says AI hype and competition may spark damaging price wars, making valuations unsustainable. He sees names like Nvidia (NVDA) facing \"significant correction\" eventually as hype fades, though presently \"it is the AI training place to go and no one has really laid a glove on the company yet.\"\n\nFor other AI exposure, Windsor advises looking at Google (GOOG,GOOGL) and Meta (META) which have \"significant exposure to AI, but it's not really been priced in.\" However, he cautions their revenue does not come from generative AI yet, making it a long-term play.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 S&P 500 stocks on the move. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 S&P 500 Stocks On the Move.\n\nThe United States economy has continued to defy expectations of a macro slowdown over the past few months and looks set to grow at a healthy pace in the first quarter of 2024. Recent figures from the Labor and Commerce departments in the US government indicate that jobs are being added to the economy at a brisk pace and strong retail sales, especially in motorsports and online purchases, have forced experts to revise growth estimates upwards. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier this week the economy was doing well and this had given the central bank some flexibility to move carefully on monetary policy.\n\nIn the first employment report of the new year, the Labor Department revealed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 216,000 jobs in December, beating forecasts by around 36,000 jobs. Per the latest data, the economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2023, down from 4.8 million in 2022. The decline should be seen in context of the 525 basis points worth of rate hikes by the Fed since the second quarter of 2022. Leisure, business, government, and manufacturing all registered increases in jobs. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in December, matching the gain in November. This raised the year-on-year increase in wages to 4.1% from 4.0% in November.\n\nThe Consumer Inflation report released by the Commerce Department also boosted investor confidence in the market. Retail sales climbed 0.6% in December after a 0.3% gain in November, beating forecasts that retail sales would only gain 0.4%. Sales increased 5.6% on a year-on-year basis in the month of December. The latest growth figures have forced experts to revise expectations of a rate cut in March to 55% from 65%. The benchmark indexes, like the S&P 500, seem unaffected by these moves, largely trading flat over the past month, as the dollar rises and Treasury values fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the S&P 500 stocks on the move as the new year gets underway include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA). Investors should closely monitor these stocks in the next few weeks to take advantage of upcoming growth catalysts. Gary Guthart, the CEO of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), recently outlined during the third quarter earnings call that his firm was focused on expanding internationally and bringing down the cost of products for newer platforms.\n\n“Areas of opportunity include our Ion program, our SP accessories portfolio, and our multiport accessories and advanced instrument lines. Given the timing of facilities completion, manufacturing efficiency improvements for new products, and other complex projects, we expect variability in gross margin over the coming quarters as we work through these programs. Turning to our digital offerings. [inaudible] for digital tools and channels is growing nicely.\n\nOur SimNow surgical simulators are installed at the majority of our customer sites, and subscription renewal rates are outstanding. Routine use of My Intuitive app by over 10,000 da Vinci surgeons grew by 140% year over year and is receiving strong Net promoter scores that continue improving over time. Our Intuitive Hub media management and telepresence system installations grew 58% in the quarter, and the hub-captured surgical cases grew 61%. In closing, core demand is healthy.\n\nWe're focused on extending our ecosystem internationally and driving our product costs down, particularly for our newer platforms. We are dogged in pursuit of significant long-term opportunity to improve the Quadruple Aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics, and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. \" S&P 500 Stocks On the Move\n\nPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThese thirty best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 over the past month were shortlisted and the top twelve selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nS&P 500 Stocks On the Move\n\n12. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 6.2%\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a biotech firm that develops therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) shares have rallied since the firm announced earlier this month that Casgevy, a gene therapy developed by the firm, had been approved by Saudi Arabian regulators for the treatment of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia in people aged 12 years or older. The company noted that Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of the genetic blood disorders in the world.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX), compared to 54 in the previous quarter worth $1.9 billion.\n\nJust like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is one of the S&P 500 stocks on the move.\n\nIn its Q2 2023 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Notable adds in the quarter included Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) and Intuit. Vertex is one of the only pharmaceutical companies in the world with an effective drug for cystic fibrosis, but the market has deemed it a slow-growth company due to existing market penetration. However, the drug is enabling patients to live longer, and the drug’s patient base is growing. Also, the company is developing a more potent formulation that we believe could increase efficacy while giving Vertex an opportunity to reprice and improve margins. Finally, its cystic fibrosis franchise is very cash generative, and the company has been using the capital to invest in a pipeline that we believe includes some interesting longer term opportunities. We added to the position after a couple of positive developments this quarter. First, its competitive position strengthened when a competitor, AbbVie, announced it will discontinue all work in cystic fibrosis. Second, there have been positive developments from the company’s pipeline, including encouraging early-stage results for a Type 1 diabetes stem cell therapy.”\n\n11. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 6.3%\n\nFastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)engages in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) stock has surged after the firm posted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023, beating market estimates on earnings per share and revenue by $0.01 and $10 million respectively. The firm also announced a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 33 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $529 million in Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST), compared to 31 the preceding quarter worth $653 million.\n\n10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 234\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 9%\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a tech firm that owns and runs social media platforms. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock has climbed in the past few weeks as analysts expect the company to beat market estimates on revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 despite headwinds like job cuts, TikTok popularity, and lawsuits. The firm has been capitalizing on catalysts like artificial intelligence innovations, secular digital ad trends and a leaner cost structure, according to analyst Brian White at investment firm Monness Crespi.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 234 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $35 billion in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 225 in the preceding quarter worth $30 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Weitz Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“As for other quarterly contributors, Alphabet, Inc., (GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) added to their exceptional year-to-date returns. Meta Platforms and Alphabet were the true year-to-date standouts. After steep declines in 2022, both stocks rebounded sharply due to a combination of solid fundamentals, disciplined operational execution, and improved sentiment. Despite outsized gains and attention, we think both Alphabet and Meta remain undervalued.”\n\n9. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 9.5%\n\nMcKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) provides healthcare services. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) stock has been on the move in the past few weeks on the back of reports that the company is planning to sell the Rexall pharmacy chain it owns in Canada. The former acquired the latter in a deal worth more than $2 billion in 2016. Rexall operates around 400 pharmacies in Canada.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based firm Viking Global is a leading shareholder in McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) with 1.4 million shares worth more than $633 million.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Partially offsetting the above was favorable stock selection in pharmaceuticals and health care distributors along with cash exposure in a declining market. Strength in pharmaceuticals and health care distributors was driven by gains from Lilly and McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK). McKesson’s stock performed well due to strong financial results in the company’s pharmaceutical distribution and prescription technology solutions businesses, driven in part by higher volumes of GLP-1 medicines and prior authorization technology services related to GLP-1 medicines.”\n\n8. ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 10.5%\n\nANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) develops and markets engineering simulation software and services worldwide. ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) stock has rallied on the back of reports that the firm would be acquired by software firm Synopsys in a deal worth $35 billion. On January 16, these reports were confirmed by the latter. The combined company expects to achieve nearly $400 million of run-rate cost synergies by year three post-closing and around $400 million of run-rate revenue synergies by year four post-closing, growing to more than $1 billion annually in the longer-term.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Impax Asset Management is a leading shareholder in ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) with 640,715 shares worth more than $190 million.\n\n7. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 85\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 10.7%\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)operates as a healthcare company worldwide. Earlier this month, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced that drug authorities in the United States had approved Keytruda, an oncology drug developed by the firm, in combination with chemoradiotherapy, for the treatment of FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA cervical cancer. The approval has increased investor confidence in the famous drugmaker that recently acquired immunotherapy developer Harpoon Therapeutics in a deal worth $680 million.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 85 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5 billion in Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), compared to 78 in the previous quarter worth $2.6 billion.\n\n6. Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 12.6%\n\nViatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) makes and sells generic drugs. Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) shares have climbed over the past few days after the firm presented future growth plans at the JPMorgan Health Conference, detailing that it plans to generate more than $2.3 billion in free cash flow over the next three to five years. It also revealed that it would reinvest 50% of the free cash flow into the business while the rest would be given to shareholders in quarterly dividends and share buybacks.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $952 million in Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS), up from 42 in the preceding quarter worth $1.1 billion.\n\nIn addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) is one of the S&P 500 stocks on the move.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the attractive healthcare sector, we look beyond the obvious to identify businesses that simultaneously have exposure to this growth industry and also trade at low prices. We’re especially drawn to companies like Viatris, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices. Furthermore, recognizing that the constantly rising cost of healthcare cannot go on forever, we have been particularly drawn to companies whose products or services play some role in managing or reducing the cost of care. As a result, we have positions in Viatris, a leading manufacturer of low-cost branded generic drugs.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 S&P 500 Stocks On the Move.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 12 Recent Additions 12 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit 14 Cheap DRIP Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.

As investment into artificial intelligence continues to pour in at competitors like Intel (INTL) or Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is it enough for these companies to catch up or even stand in the way of Nvidia's dominance?\n\nYahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins the Live show as part of Yahoo Finance's special AI Revolution coverage this week, to discuss all things AI, starting with Nvidia's spot at the top, which competitor is making gains, and where the AI race will go moving forward.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right. Well, we want to get to one of the big themes here at Yahoo Finance, and that is AI. Certainly has been driving the market's momentum as of lately, and you have to look no further than NVIDIA. This stock has certainly been a standout so far this year, and especially looking at that one-year chart where shares up just about 250%. So what company, could a company potentially derail some of the rally, some of the momentum that we're seeing in NVIDIA? And for that, we want to bring in Dan Howley, our Tech Editor, who has closely been tracking what has turned out to be a phenomenal story right now for the markets, Dan.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah. NVIDIA, basically, is just, you know, the AI King, right? And they have been for quite some time. I think, you know, this is something that years ago when they first started investing in AI, the idea was they just went to universities and said, you know, what can you guys do with these powerful graphics processors that we have. And AI happen to be one of the things that came up. And so, you know, they began investing, companies thought that they were crazy and their own backers thought that they were crazy. They were like, why are you dumping so much money into this? It's paying off huge, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nThey eclipsed the $1 trillion mark as far as market cap goes in June. And they were closing on a $1.5 trillion as of Friday. But there are some rivals out there. And I just want to go over a few of them here. The big ones really are AMD, which has been kind of a longtime thorn in their side, and Intel, surprisingly, 0 Intel. And I say surprisingly only because they haven't done as well in the graphics card space at all. And so when you look at what Intel and AMD are doing, right now NVIDIA's best chip is the H100, AMD has the MI300, which they announced in December.\n\nIntel is working on their Gouty AI Accelerator. Those are going to be potential options that companies can use in place of NVIDIA's offerings. Now, it's important to note that NVIDIA, they are the leader when it comes to hardware. They're miles ahead of everyone else. It's going to take years for other companies to catch up. But on the software side, they're also huge. That's a big moat for them where they have this Cuda software where companies can go out and build their own kind of AI platforms around this. And so that helps keep people wrapped into the NVIDIA system.\n\nSo it's a big deal here. Hyperscalers also have their own chips that they're making that could also prove troublesome for NVIDIA.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Right. And, Dan, I mean, we talk about AI all the time as this broad concept that is going to certainly revolutionize change tech forever. Can you tell us, though, exactly how consumers can use AI right now? Where is it present in my fingertips even.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: So right now-- it's funny. If you ask Intel, right, they announced this event, they had this AI everywhere event, and they have new chips where they have NPU, Neural Processing Units. Those have been in the iPhone for a long time, right? Neural Processing Engine. So now they're in Intel chips, they're in AMD chips, they're in Qualcomm chips. So they're coming to they're coming to laptops, desktops, they're coming to smartphones now. The new Samsung phone, the Galaxy 24, as well as Google's Pixel has them. You can expect Apple probably to get on the train more with generative AI.\n\nIf you ask Intel what that means, though, they literally say we don't know right now, we don't know yet. Developers have to come out with apps that take advantage of this. But there are some ways that you can take advantage of it. When you use your laptop or desktop, you can run generative AI apps on there. So if you want to do some generative AI with images or with text, the idea is that you would be able then to do it all locally, that means more security, more privacy since you're not sending your data up to the cloud. It's all on device. That's with the laptop and desktop. Microsoft is doing that.\n\nOn the phone with Samsung or Google, there's image generative AI, where you can change around some photos. I can make myself look like I can slam dunk. I cannot. I can't--\n\nBRAD SMITH: You told me you could.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Well, yeah. That was a lie. So there goes all my integrity. But I can jump like an inch maybe, but I can make it look like I'm a monster.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Jump an inch.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I got weak ankles, weak ankles.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Well, thanks to generative AI, you can jump much higher, Dan.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I can live my dream.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yes.",

        "title": "Nvidia's Key Market China Wants To Beat US Embargo, Boosts Chipmaking Machinery Imports by 14%",
        "content": "In 2023, China witnessed a significant 14% increase in imports of chipmaking machines, reaching nearly $40 billion, despite a general decline of 5.5% in total imports.\n\nThis surge, one of the largest since 2015, reflects Chinese chip companies’ efforts to build new semiconductor factories and boost national capabilities amidst U.S.-imposed export controls.\n\nThese restrictions have hampered Chinese access to advanced chipmaking machinery, slowing the development of the country’s high-tech sector, Bloomberg reports.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) accounts for up to 90% of China’s $7 billion AI chip market.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang said China made up roughly 33.33% of the U.S. tech industry’s market.\n\nAlso Read:Is Nvidia Benefiting From US Sanctions On China?\n\nJensen Huang recently made his first trip to China in four years amid escalating U.S.-China tech competition.\n\nDuring early this month, Huang visited Nvidia’s offices in Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Beijing. Online posts over the weekend showed him interacting with staff in traditional attire.\n\nA notable rise in China’s imports from the Netherlands occurred last year in anticipation of new export controls, impacting companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.\n\nIn December, lithography equipment imports from the Netherlands skyrocketed by nearly 1,000% to $1.1 billion as firms accelerated purchases before the Dutch restrictions came into effect.\n\nBefore these export bans, ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML), a Dutch company, had already halted shipments of some high-end machines to China following the U.S. government’s request.\n\nThis move predated the formal implementation of the export bans on sophisticated chipmaking equipment.\n\nThese developments highlight China’s growing challenges in advancing its semiconductor industry amid international regulatory pressures.\n\nIn 2023, reports indicated China’s establishment of a $40 billion state fund to support its chip industry, marking a determined response to the U.S. embargo on acquiring advanced AI chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nStory continues\n\nThis fund, aiming for a record 300 billion yuan ($41 billion), will focus on chip manufacturing equipment. Concurrently, Huawei Technologies and SMIC’s development of an advanced 7-nanometer smartphone processor illustrates China’s progress in creating a domestic chip ecosystem.\n\nReports also suggested that many Chinese semiconductor design companies tapped Malaysian firms to assemble high-end chips, mainly graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nIn November, as the U.S. sanctions kicked in, Nvidia lost to Huawei Technologies Co for a sizeable artificial intelligence chip order from Chinese tech giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).\n\nCompanies like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY) reportedly indicated their intentions to reduce their Nvidia chips orders substantially.\n\nChinese cloud companies sourcing nearly 80% of high-end AI chips from Nvidia could reportedly curtail orders by 50%-60% within five years.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via ASML\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Nvidia's Key Market China Wants To Beat US Embargo, Boosts Chipmaking Machinery Imports by 14% originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "4 Solid S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Bet on as Index Hits All-Time High",
        "content": "Wall Street showed volatility to start the New Year. However, stocks have since then rebounded and three major indexes officially entered the bull market last week, with the S&P 500 Index hitting an all-time high. The S&P 500 closed at 4,839.81 points on Friday to record its highest close since January 2022.\n\nWall Street had a solid 2023 after a disappointing 2022 as 40-year-high inflation took a toll on stocks and the Federal Reserve implemented an aggressive interest rate hike policy to normalize the situation. This saw the S&P 500 giving up 19% in 2022.\n\nThe high interest rate regime continued in 2023 but markets rebounded as inflation started showing signs of easing. The Fed left interest rates unchanged for the first time in July last year before keeping it steady in its last three FOMC meetings after hiking rates by 525 basis points.\n\nSlowing inflation and a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve sent stocks on a year-end rally that saw the S&P 500 recording a 24% gain in 2023 as fears of a recession waned.\n\nS&P to Rally in 2024\n\nEconomists now expect that the economy will make a softer landing as inflation has eased considerably. The Federal Reserve has also hinted at cutting interest rates this year. Although the optimism among investors about the first interest rate cut coming in March has somewhat wanted, rate cuts are happening for sure in 2024.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, 47.2% feel that a 25-basis point rate cut is possible in March. This was, however, more than 90% at the beginning of this year. Several Fed officials have indicated at least three 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.\n\nLower interest rates bode well for stock markets. A low risk-free interest rate will bring down the discount rate, leading to an increase in the net present value of investments in equities.\n\nAlso, the economy is on solid ground. The third-quarter GDP grew 4.9% and according to the Atlanta Fed, the nation’s GDP is projected to grow 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in four S&P 500 stocks such as American Water Works Company, Inc.

        "content": "The S&P 500 has some of the best stocks and biggest names that are worth adding to your portfolio. 2024 has begun on an optimistic note and we could see several stocks hitting new highs this year. Many of these are mega-cap stocks – analysts love them and they have shown steady growth and revenue. With the economy improving, we could expect rate cuts soon and this will help the companies achieve stronger growth. Even the upcoming fourth-quarter earnings could give a boost to these undervalued S&P 500 stocks. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nUndervalued S&P 500 Stocks: Airbnb (ABNB) Person holding Airbnb logo over the cityscape of Rome, Italy. ABNB stock.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) has become a household name and the company is enjoying some of its best days. It has recovered from the effects of the pandemic and is generating impressive cash today.\n\nThe travel industry is massive and Airbnb has a huge addressable market. After the pandemic, travelers are preferring to stay at an Airbnb instead of a hotel. Its user base is growing, and the company saw an 18% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in the recent quarter. This is one company that will remain relevant for years to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYes, ABNB stock isn’t cheap. It is trading for $137 but still looks undervalued to me. It is much lower than the 52-week high of $154 and has dropped 5% in the past six months. Airbnb is a cash flow machine that will report impressive fourth-quarter results driven by the holiday season. Buy the stock before it soars higher.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are multiple reasons to like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and it is one of the top stocks to hold in 2024. SBUX stock is down 10% in the past year and trading at $93, below the 52-week high of $115.\n\nThe company is a well-established business with a global presence and it has an aggressive plan to expand in India this year.

        "title": "S&amp;P 500 Index Hits All-Time High: 5 Must-Buy Stocks",
        "content": "The S&P 500 Index — better known as Wall Street’s broad market benchmark — achieved a milestone as it closed at an all-time high of 4,839.81. The index posted its previous closing high on January 2022. In intraday trading, the index reached 4,842.07, reflecting its new all-time high after January 2022.\n\nS&P 500 Regains Mojo in 2023\n\nWall Street had a highly disappointing 2022 as the inflation rate had reached a record high and the Fed had initiated an aggressive interest rate rise policy to combat elevated price levels. Accordingly, the S&P 500 lost 19%.\n\nThe situation was exactly the reverse in 2023. A gradually declining inflation rate enabled the central bank to pause rate hikes since July 2023. Consequently, the broad-market benchmark witnessed an impressive bull run of 24% last year.\n\nThe momentum continues in January 2024 as recently released several economic data like nonfarm payroll, weekly jobless claims, factory orders and retail sales of December clearly indicated that the U.S. economy is nowhere near even a mild recession.\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool reveals just a 47.2% probability that the Fed will lower the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points. This probability was more than 80% three weeks ago. However, the interest rate futures tool is also showing the possibility of five 25 basis- points rate cuts in 2024.\n\nRally Likely to Continue in 2024\n\nIn any case, the Fed is set to initiate an interest rate reduction in 2024. A lower interest rate regime should be beneficial for stock markets. A low risk-free interest rate will reduce the discount rate, thereby increasing the net present value of investment in equities.\n\nSecond, the global supply-chain system has been restored slowly since last year as U.S. corporate behemoths are rescheduling their supply-chain system’s bypassing of China. Moreover, the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain firm despite record-high-inflation and interest rate. The latest report of the Atlanta Fed projected that the U.S. GDP would grow 2.4% in fourth-quarter 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, a preliminary estimate revealed that a massive $1.4 trillion entered U.S. money market funds primarily due to an extremely high interest rate regime, with cash yielding around 5%. A systematic decline in the market interest rate will shift a major part of these gigantic funds to equity markets.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five S&P 500 stocks that have strong growth potential in 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 53.7% and 63.1%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025).

        "title": "3 S&amp;P 500 Growth Stocks to Buy as Index Enjoys Bull Market",
        "content": "The S&P 500 bounced back in 2023 after taking a beating in the prior year, gaining an encouraging 24% as steady economic growth squashed any expectations of an impending recession, while price pressures came down to levels that compelled the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 was off to a rough start in 2024 as market participants took some profits in tech bigwigs such as Apple Inc. AAPL. But they recently returned to buy back those magnificent tech players, helping the S&P 500 enter a bull market. The broader index has soared more than 35% from its October 2022 low.\n\nFor the first time, the S&P 500 finished at a record close, in more than two years. The index has also set an intraday record high after gyrating in a tight trading range for nearly a month. The large-cap benchmark closed at 4,839.81 on Jan 19 and exceeded the previous record close of 4,796.56 achieved on Jan 3, 2022. Additionally, the index hit an intraday high of 4,842.07, easily topping the intraday record of 4,818.62 attained on Jan 4, 2022, per FactSet data.\n\nNow, bull markets generally tend to last for quite some time. The previous bull market that started in March 2020 continued for less than two years. What’s more, the bull market that began before that prevailed for almost 10 years. It began from the Great Recession period till the outbreak of the coronavirus in February 2020. Similarly, the current bull market is expected to continue as stocks gain momentum, banking on a less hawkish Fed, upbeat consumer sentiment, and uptick in tech stocks.\n\nAs inflation has started to show signs of cooling down, the Fed has kept its interest rates unchanged in the last meeting and is widely expected to trim rates this year. Interest rate cuts are always a boon for the stock market as they boost consumer outlays, decrease the cost of borrowings, and pep up the economy (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates in 2024).\n\nStory continues\n\nAmericans are anyhow feeling much more optimistic about the current and future business scenarios, thanks to the strength in the labor market. The University of Michigan stated that its consumer sentiment index surged 21.4% year over year in January and touched its highest level since July 2021. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index, too, had touched the highest level in December since July (read more: Raise a Toast to These 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks in 2024).\n\nTech stocks, meanwhile, are gaining traction due to AI optimism. Taiwan Semiconductor’s TSM latest upbeat earnings report also bolstered confidence for the chip sector. Gains in mega-cap tech stocks eventually erased the S&P 500’s 2024 losses. Hence, with the S&P 500 scaling upward, it's prudent for astute investors to place bets on growth stocks listed in the index.\n\nSome of the prominent names are NVIDIA NVDA, Salesforce CRM, and Amazon.com AMZN. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 12.9% over the past 60 days. NVDA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268.6%.\n\nSalesforce is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Salesforce currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. CRM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 56.5%.\n\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.8% over the past 60 days.

        "title": "1 Brilliant Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024",
        "content": "Few stocks outperformed Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in 2023, but one notable exception was Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), often referred to as Supermicro. With the stock edging out Nvidia by gaining 246% versus Nvidia's 239% in 2023, investors might be surprised to hear that Supermicro could still be a strong buy.\n\nHowever, after digging into the company, it's clear it still has a long runway. Furthermore, it can be purchased for a reasonable price -- something Nvidia cannot say.\n\nSupermicro makes highly configurable servers tailored to any need\n\nThe reason Nvidia grew so much in 2023 was the massive demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are perfect for processing large workloads.\n\nIn 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) took off, causing a huge demand for Nvidia's products. However, companies can't just buy a GPU or two and call it a day. Instead, they buy hundreds or thousands of these units and connect them to create a supercomputer.\n\nMost companies don't have the expertise to do this properly, so they outsource server design and production to other suppliers, which is where Supermicro fits in. Its servers are highly customizable and can be tailored to any workload size or focus; it has servers specializing in AI, engineering simulation, and drug discovery, among other purposes.\n\nAnd it works closely with Nvidia to squeeze out every bit of performance possible from its GPUs.\n\nSo, with Supermicro benefiting from the same trend as Nvidia, it makes sense as an investment alternative to the latter. But its stock can be had for a more reasonable price.\n\nSupermicro trades at a discount to Nvidia for a good reason\n\nOne of the gripes with Nvidia is that it trades at a premium: 65 times trailing earnings and 40 times forward earnings. Those are high expectations, and it doesn't leave much room for error if the company doesn't hit projections.\n\nOn the flip side, Supermicro has a fairly reasonable valuation right now, especially when you focus on forward earnings.\n\nStory continues SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nSupermicro is expected to grow rapidly this year as the demand Nvidia experienced for its GPUs is translated into the next product in the value chain: Supermicro's servers. This will help it, along with its goal of achieving $20 billion in annual revenue (its current trailing-12-month total is $7.4 million).\n\nHowever, one area Supermicro doesn't have an edge over Nvidia is with its margins. Because Supermicro is assembling products and not creating them, it doesn't have as much control over the prices it charges. SMCI Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nFurthermore, its technology isn't that innovative. Anyone could launch a business that creates servers with GPUs, but starting a new GPU business from the ground up would be nearly impossible. As a result, there is some risk in Supermicro's stock since it faces stiff competition from IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nSo, should that discourage investors from taking a position in Supermicro's stock? I don't think so. AI proliferation is a rising tide lifting many companies, although first-tier producers like Nvidia could benefit the most, which is why the stock has a huge premium.\n\nSupermicro might not be able to control its destiny, but it sits at the crossroads of a generational technological shift, making it a great investment right now that can be purchased at a reasonable price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "The stock market has cooled a bit since the calendar turned over to 2024, but last year ended with a bang. Thanks to a year-end rally, the S&P 500 ended the year up 24%, and the Nasdaq gained 43%. These results made investors feel good but also drove up some great companies' valuations. The price you pay does matter, and some companies look richly valued.\n\nThere will be a stock market sell-off at some point, although nobody knows when. Some investors like to have a watch list of stocks to buy once prices dip. Here are three growth stocks I am keeping an eye on to add to, once the market cools.\n\n1. Fortinet\n\nFortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT), a long-established cybersecurity company with a track record of impressive growth, is at the top of my buy list. It might not get as many headlines as its more-flashy peers, but Fortinet has a long track record of success in its field.\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in 2009, Fortinet has been profitable and free-cash-flow positive every year.\n\nSlowdowns in revenue and billings growth affected Fortinet's stock in 2023, with double-digit drops following the last two quarters' earnings releases. Management cited a slowdown in a part of the business called Secure Networking. Fortinet believes this is a near-term challenge and expects this market opportunity to continue to grow for several years.\n\nDespite slowing growth, third-quarter revenue increased by 16%, and billings grew by 6% year over year. Bottom-line results were more impressive with earnings per share increasing by 41%. Even at a slowing growth rate, Fortinet is still a formidable growth company that's a leader in the cybersecurity space.\n\nEven after two large drawdowns in 2023, Fortinet's stock is up 28% over the last year, slightly outpacing the S&P 500. This places its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple at 43. While this is below the company's historical average, it certainly isn't cheap. For comparison, competitor Cisco Systems trades for only 15 times earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet is a quality business, but there could be better price points in the future.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nFor investors who follow the semiconductor and artificial intelligence (AI) spaces, news about Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been unavoidable over the past year. The past two quarters (Nvidia's second and third of fiscal 2024) have featured triple-digit revenue growth.\n\nThis has been led by its data center segment, which saw revenue growth of 279% in the third quarter.\n\nAt some point, this growth will slow, but it's impossible to know when. Based on recent reports of companies continuing to buy Nvidia's most advanced chips, these impressive increases could be here for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the current quarter, the company is projecting total revenue growth of more than 200%.\n\nNvidia currently trades for 75 times earnings and 81 times free cash flow. These multiples are above the company's 10-year historical average. Buying shares at these prices could work out if the growth projections hold, but considering the cyclical nature of the semiconductor space, it's reasonable to assume there will be better buying opportunities ahead.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nSemiconductor device and software developer Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) has also seen tailwinds related to AI. Over the past year, Broadcom stock is up nearly 100% and is currently near its all-time high. Shares now trade for around 35 times earnings and 28 times free cash flow.\n\nWhen Broadcom reported its fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2023 results in December, the market reaction was likely due to guidance rather than reported results. Year-over-year revenue growth slowed to 4% and earnings-per-share growth slipped to 5%. Both of these growth rates have been significantly higher over the last few years.\n\nOn the flip side, the company's guidance suggests that 2024 will be a much better year. Fiscal 2024 revenue is expected to be $50 billion, which represents a 39% increase over the fiscal 2023 revenue of $36 billion.\n\nThe current price and valuation are based on growth reaccelerating in 2024, due in part to AI-related spending by its customers.\n\nToday's price is not cheap, but also not incredibly expensive by Broadcom's historical valuation. This company should remain at the forefront of the semiconductor and AI space for years to come and should be at the top of investors' watch lists for any market sell-off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Fortinet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Fortinet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Fortinet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Will TSMC Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?",
        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), also known as TSMC, is the world's largest, most advanced contract chipmaker. It manufactures the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips for \"fabless\" chipmakers like Apple, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, and it's widely considered a bellwether of the semiconductor sector.\n\nBut last year, Nvidia actually became the world's first trillion-dollar chipmaker instead of TSMC. That was a bit surprising, since TSMC still generates more annual revenue than Nvidia, but Nvidia's valuations were also inflated by the buying frenzy in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past two years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia still has an enterprise value of $1.4 trillion today, while TSMC is only worth $460 billion. Could TSMC catch up and become a trillion-dollar chipmaker by 2030? Let's review its recent growth rates and roadmap for the future to find out.\n\nIs TSMC's next growth cycle beginning?\n\nTSMC's revenue generally rises and falls with the semiconductor sector's growth cycles. It experienced a major slowdown in 2019, when sluggish sales of smartphones created a supply glut in memory chips, but its growth accelerated again in 2020 as the trade war and pandemic turned that glut into a shortage.\n\nTSMC continued to grow through 2021 and 2022 as new 5G smartphones hit the market, PC makers sold more systems for remote work and online classes, and data centers upgraded their servers to process more AI applications. In 2023, it suffered another downturn as the 5G upgrade cycle ended, the PC market cooled off, and the macro headwinds drove many companies to slow down their big data center upgrades. That's why its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) declined for the full year.\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue growth 3.7% 25.2% 18.5% 42.6% (4.5%) Gross margin 46% 53.1% 51.6% 59.6% 54.4% EPS growth (1.7%) 50% 15.2% 70.4% (17.5%)\n\nData source: TSMC. TWD terms.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut for 2024, TSMC expects its revenue to grow in the \"low to mid-20%\" range in USD terms. During the conference call, CEO C.C. Wei attributed that acceleration to the \"strong ramp\" of its latest 3-nanometer chips, \"strong demand\" for its high-end 5nm chips, and \"robust AI-related demand.\" Those comments strongly suggest TSMC is finally ready to grow again.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2025, analysts expect TSMC's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 14%. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 15 times forward earnings.\n\nTSMC could face tougher challenges after 2025\n\nTSMC started mass-producing its smallest 3nm chips in late 2022, and it plans to ramp up its production of 2nm chips in 2025. Rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which aims to catch up to TSMC in the process race by 2025, plans to launch its 18A (1.8nm) chips (which could be comparable to TSMC's 3nm chips in terms of density) by the end of this year.\n\nIntel is still one to two chip generations behind TSMC, but it's also adopting ASML's (NASDAQ: ASML) next-gen high-NA extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- which will be required to produce smaller chips beyond the 2nm node -- before TSMC. TSMC believes it can push its existing EUV systems to the limit to manufacture 2nm chips at a lower price, and it reportedly won't start using ASML's high-NA systems until after 2030.\n\nThat bold bet might save TSMC a lot of money, since ASML's high-NA systems cost about $300 million each, but it could also erode its defenses against Intel -- which plans to challenge TSMC by expanding its own third-party foundry services.\n\nTSMC has an easy mathematical path toward $1 trillion\n\nAssuming TSMC's valuations hold steady, it would only need to grow its EPS at a CAGR of 10% from 2023 to 2030 to double its stock price and boost its enterprise value to nearly $1 trillion. TSMC should easily achieve that growth rate -- even if the semiconductor market suffers another cyclical slowdown over the next seven years.\n\nTSMC will probably only face two unpredictable challenges: Intel's aggressive attempts to catch up in the process race, and a potential military or trade conflict between China and Taiwan, where TSMC still manufactures its most advanced chips. But even if Intel catches up, it could struggle to pull away TSMC's longtime customers. If China actually tries to take over or blockade Taiwan, it would likely trigger a catastrophic market crash and crush most tech stocks along with TSMC.\n\nSimply put, I believe TSMC will be worth well over $1 trillion by 2030. It still faces some near-term and long-term challenges, but I don't think any other company -- including Intel and Samsung -- can replace it as the world's top contract chipmaker.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Could Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has made a lot of investors millionaires since Lisa Su took the helm as the chipmaker's CEO on Oct. 8, 2014. AMD's stock has risen 4,780% since that fateful day -- and a $25,000 investment would have grown into $1.25 million today. That same investment in AMD's larger rival Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) would only be worth $33,500 today.\n\nLet's see why AMD outperformed Intel by such a wide margin -- and if it might turn a fresh $25,000 investment into more than $1 million again over the next few decades. Image source: AMD.\n\nWhy did AMD become a millionaire-maker stock?\n\nWhen Su became AMD's CEO, the chipmaker was losing the CPU market to Intel and ceding the GPU market to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Su reversed those losses with three main strategies.\n\nFirst, AMD developed more custom APUs -- which merged together CPUs and GPUs -- for Sony's PlayStation consoles and Microsoft's Xbox consoles. The growth of that business generated fresh cash for the development of new PC chips.\n\nSecond, AMD rebooted its x86 CPUs with brand new designs that addressed the single-thread shortcomings of its previous Bulldozer chips. That massive reset led to its launches of its Ryzen CPUs for PCs and Epyc CPUs for servers in 2017. Lastly, AMD outsourced the production of those chips to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's most advanced contract chipmaker, as Intel struggled with persistent shortages and delays at its own first-party foundries.\n\nAccording to PassMark Software, AMD's share of the PC CPU market soared from 17.5% in the third quarter of 2016 to 39.1% in first quarter of 2021. Intel's share shrank from 82.5% to 60.4% during the same period.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2022, AMD's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33%, its adjusted gross margin expanded from 31% to 52%, and its adjusted operating margin rose from 1% to 27%. That incredible turnaround turned AMD into one of the market's hottest growth stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next few years could be challenging\n\nOver the past year, AMD struggled with slower growth as sales of new PCs cooled off in a post-pandemic market. Its revenue rose 44% in 2022, but that growth included its acquisition of the programmable chipmaker Xilinx. Analysts expect its revenue to decline 4% in 2023 as it laps that acquisition and grapples with slower PC sales.\n\nThe next few years could also be challenging for AMD as Intel ramps up its spending to catch up to TSMC in the \"process race\" to manufacture smaller and denser chips. If Intel's first-party foundries overtake TSMC in that race, it could produce more advanced chips than AMD again. Intel's newest generation of Meteor Lake chips, which launched last month, could gradually narrow that gap and further expand its market share against AMD.\n\nTo make matters worse, AMD could struggle to keep pace with Nvidia's latest GPUs -- which JPR estimates account for almost 90% of the discrete GPU market. Nvidia remains the clear leader in both gaming and artificial intelligence (AI) GPUs for data centers -- but AMD hasn't proven that it can carve out a meaningful niche in the AI market with its new AI-oriented Instinct GPUs yet.\n\nCan AMD generate more millionaire-maker gains?\n\nThese challenges could make it difficult for AMD to replicate its millionaire-making gains from the past nine years. Assuming its valuations hold steady, it would need to grow its earnings per share (EPS) at a CAGR of 45% over the next 10 years to turn a $25,000 investment into $1 million. Analysts expect its EPS to grow at a CAGR of 56% from 2022 to 2025, but its growth beyond 2025 is unpredictable and will rely heavily on its ability to stay ahead of Intel and Nvidia.\n\nIt could be a close race. Intel plans to start producing its 18A (1.8-nanometer) chips in the second half of 2024, which could be roughly comparable to TSMC's 3nm chips. AMD's upcoming Ryzen 8000 chips, which will also arrive in late 2024, will be built on TSMC's 4nm and 3nm nodes. On the GPU front, AMD and Nvidia both outsource the production of most of their chips to TSMC -- but Nvidia's recent production of lower-end GPUs could undermine AMD's strategy of selling cheaper GPUs.\n\nAll of these challenges, along with AMD's high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 43, suggest it could be difficult for the chipmaker to generate millionaire-making gains over the next 10 years. But if patient investors take a longer-term view and give AMD 20 to 30 years to grow, I believe this stock could still turn them into millionaires -- as long as the company sticks with Su's shrewd strategies and doesn't fall too far behind Intel and Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Sells Graphics and AI Chips, but 15% of Sales Come From Other Multi-Hundred-Billion Dollar Markets",
        "content": "In 1999, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) revolutionized computer graphics with the invention of the graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip capable of rendering ultra-realistic visual effects. Nvidia GPUs have since become the gold standard in gaming and professional design. The company holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors.\n\nIn 2006, Nvidia moved beyond graphics when it introduced CUDA, a programming model that turned its GPUs into general purpose processors fit to accelerate data center applications like artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia GPUs are now the gold standard in data center accelerators, and the company holds an 80% to 95% market share in AI chips, according to analysts.\n\nNot surprisingly, given its dominance in graphics and AI processors, Nvidia is frequently described as a chipmaker. But that definition is somewhat misleading, because it fails to capture the scope and direction of the business. Nvidia currently derives about 15% of total revenue from adjacent multi-hundred-billion markets.\n\nNvidia has a $1 billion software and services business\n\nNvidia reported revenue of $18 billion in the third quarter. That figure becomes $72 billion when annualized (multiplied by four). GPUs for gaming, professional design, and data centers accounted for most of that total, but management said software and services revenue would exceed an annual run rate of $1 billion by year end. That means Nvidia derives about 1.3% of total revenue from software and services.\n\nThat percentage may sound insignificant, but the figure is growing rapidly. The three products detailed below form the core of the software and services business. The first became available in late 2021, but the other two became available less than one year ago. As such, Nvidia has rapidly turned software and services into a billion-dollar business.\n\nAI Enterprise is a suite of software and frameworks that supports the development of AI applications across a range of disciplines, such as recommender systems in retail, intelligent digital assistants in customer service, and route optimization in logistics. DGX Cloud is a cloud service that combines supercomputing infrastructure, pretrained models, and Nvidia AI Enterprise software to create an AI-as-a-service offering. Businesses can use DGX cloud to build AI applications without actually purchasing Nvidia GPUs. Omniverse Cloud is a cloud service that combines GPU-accelerated infrastructure with design and simulation software. It supports 3D application development and synthetic data generation, which can be used to train autonomous robots and self-driving cars.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor context, management says AI Enterprise, DGX Cloud, and Omniverse Cloud collectively represent a $300 billion addressable market. That means they account for almost one-third of the company's $1 trillion total addressable market.\n\nHere's the upshot: Nvidia is more than a chipmaker. It is a full-stack accelerated computing company, because its portfolio spans infrastructure, software, and services. That makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for graphics and AI, which cements its leadership status in both spaces.\n\nTo quote CFRA analyst Angelo Zino, \"We believe ... [Nvidia's] full-stack AI and software capabilities provide an incredible competitive moat.\"\n\nNvidia has a $10 billion networking business\n\nIn 2019, Nvidia extended its data center presence by acquiring networking company Mellanox. Nvidia has since melded its own innovations with Mellanox technology to great effect. Networking revenue nearly tripled over the past year, becoming a $10 billion business. That means Nvidia derives about 13.8% of revenue from networking infrastructure, a market expected to approach $200 billion in 2024.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia networking products are purpose-built for AI. Its InfiniBand networking platform is the gold standard in AI infrastructure for large-scale consumer internet companies and cloud providers, and it has already been adopted by Microsoft, according to CFO Colette Kress. Additionally, Nvidia recently announced Spectrum-X Ethernet networking for enterprise AI. That platform will be available early this year.\n\nHere's the upshot: Nvidia has improved its ability to monetize AI with InfiniBand and Spectrum. But those platforms also make its entire product portfolio more attractive by extending its full-stack strategy. Larger cloud companies and smaller enterprises can purchase all the requisite technology for developing, deploying, and running AI workloads from a single vendor. That drives cost savings by simplifying implementation and reducing complexity.\n\nTo quote Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, \"Nvidia's value proposition at the core is we are the lowest cost solution.\"\n\nNvidia stock is a worthwhile long-term investment\n\nNvidia was the best-performing S&P 500 stock last year, as enthusiasm surrounding generative AI drove its share price 239% higher. But the company remains well positioned to create value for patient shareholders, especially as its ability to monetize AI improves through continued success with software, services, and networking products (currently about 15% of total sales).\n\nGoing forward, the graphics processor market is expected to increase at roughly 28% annually through 2030, while the AI market is projected to increase at 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at annual sales growth exceeding 25% through the end of the decade.\n\nIn that context, its current valuation of 31 times sales is tolerable, despite being a substantial premium to the three-year average of 23.6 times sales. To be clear, Nvidia is not without risk, and shares are not cheap. But patient investors should consider buying a small position in Nvidia stock today, especially as part of a larger basket of AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuang visited China to \"celebrate new year with employees\", an Nvidia spokesperson told the South China Morning Post in a statement on Sunday, declining to disclose more details of his trip.\n\nThe trip was the billionaire founder's first visit to China in more than four years, as the US chip giant remains in the cross hairs of intensified technology rivalry and escalated tensions between the US and China.\n\nHuang's last public appearance in China was in December 2019, when he spoke about the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the automotive, video gaming and healthcare sectors.\n\nIn June last year, the Nvidia chief executive reportedly planned to visit Shanghai, where he was to meet executives from Chinese technology companies including Tencent Holdings, TikTok owner ByteDance and smartphone giant Xiaomi. Huang, however, ended up cancelling the trip.\n\nHuang's latest visit came as Nvidia faces increasing headwinds in the Chinese market. Last October, the US government further tightened chip export restrictions, blocking China's access to graphics processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia had specifically designed for Chinese clients in response to earlier curbs.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia expects its sales to China and other US-restricted destinations, which together contributed about 20 to 25 per cent of its data-centre revenue in the past several quarters, to \"decrease significantly\" in the fourth quarter because of the new rules, the company said in financial statements released in November.\n\n\"We have to come up with new chips that comply with the regulation, and once we comply with the regulation, we'll go back to China,\" Huang said in November at The New York Times' DealBook conference in New York. \"We try to do business with everybody we can. On the other hand, our national security matters. Our national competitiveness matters.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its “Polen Focus Growth Strategy” fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the quarter the fund returned 14.43% (net) compared to 14.16% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 11.69% for the S&P 500 Index. For the full year, the fund returned 38.99% (net) compared to 42.68% and 26.29% returns for the indexes. The firm had the second-highest return in the Portfolio's 35-year history in 2023.  In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy featured stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. On January 19, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $594.91 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 21.83%, and its shares gained 209.96% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $1.469 trillion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Apple and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. NVIDIA shares rocketed higher by well over 200% in 2023 although they slightly underperformed our Portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth in the fourth quarter. Generative AI has been a huge boon for NVIDIA as the use of LLMs like ChatGPT and others requires tremendous processing power that, today, is mostly provided by NVIDIA’s GPUs. All large cloud service providers, AI factories, and many large consumer internet companies are laying the foundation for generative AI by deploying NVIDIA GPUs and other parallel processing chips to be able to do large scale generative AI either for internal use (i.e., Meta) or as a service for others (i.e., AI factories) or both (cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\n\nGiven many of NVIDIA’s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn’t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peaks.\n\nWe believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, but we also believe the long-term growth outcomes are currently too variable, and the expectations built into the company’s $1.2 trillion valuation as of this writing assume the most optimistic of those scenarios.\"\n\nStory continues Nvidia, Software\n\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in fifth position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "title": "Futures higher, FAA recommends more Boeing safety checks - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures gain on Monday, in a possible sign of ongoing upward momentum after a tech-fueled surge in equities last week. The U.S. aviation authority recommends new safety checks on Boeing (NYSE:BA) planes that have similar features to a jet model involved in a mid-air door plug breach earlier this month. Sony (NYSE:SONY) pulls the plug on a mega-merger with India's Zee Entertainment, sparking a potential legal battle.\n\n1. Futures inch higher\n\nU.S. stock futures edged into the green on Monday, pointing to a continuation in an artificial intelligence-powered rally that pushed the benchmark S&P 500 up to its first record high close in two years in the prior session.\n\nBy 05:17 ET (10:17 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had added 14 points or 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures had gained 95 points or 0.6%, and Dow futures had climbed by 53 points or 0.1%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all ended Friday more than 1% higher, fueled by an upgraded second-quarter profit forecast from server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The bullish outlook drove a steep jump in AI chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), as a well as a surge in the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index to a fresh all-time high.\n\nEnthusiasm around AI had been bolstered earlier in the week by top contract chipmaker TSMC, which forecast a 20% increase in revenue this year thanks to soaring demand for the potential applications of the nascent technology.\n\nFollowing a day of heavy volume on U.S. exchanges, the S&P 500 rose by 1.23%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.7%, and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.05%.\n\n2. FAA recommends further Boeing checks\n\nThe U.S. aviation authority has recommended that airlines carry out inspections of door plugs on Boeing 737-900ER aircraft, saying that they have an identical design to a jet involved in a dangerous mid-air breach earlier this month.\n\nIn a statement released late on Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration said that operators of the 737-900ER are \"encouraged to conduct a visual inspection\" to ensure that the door plug is \"restrained from any movements.\" The FAA said the move is designed to create \"an added layer of safety.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe FAA added that some operators have \"noted findings\" with bolts on the 737-900ER in previous maintenance inspections of mid-exit door plugs. While it is not a part of Boeing's Max fleet, the 737-900ER has the same optional door plug seen in the U.S. planemaker's newer family of jets.\n\nBoeing, which has already come under intense scrutiny in recent years over safety concerns, has faced further pressure since a non-fatal blowout on its 737-9 Max model operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5. The FAA grounded 171 of the 737-9 Max planes after the incident.\n\n3. Earnings season ramps up\n\nInvestors will be looking ahead to a slate of key earnings later this week, with big-name companies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) all set to unveil their latest results.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that the quarterly figures will help determine the staying power of the S&P 500's recent rally.\n\n\"If [...] we find out that the market has either gotten ahead of itself [...] or we get guidance from some of these companies that doesn't match the bullish sentiment that's being priced into them, that can be a real risk,” Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) told Reuters.\n\nOutside of the U.S., some of Europe's most high-profile tech firms are due to report, including chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML), computer accessories maker Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI), software developer SAP (ETR:SAPG), and fashion behemoth LVMH (EPA:LVMH).\n\n4. Sony ends Zee merger talks\n\nSony has terminated merger discussions between its Indian unit and Zee Entertainment, putting an end to a long-running series of negotiations over a deal that would have created a $10 billion giant in one of the world's fastest-growing economies.\n\nThe Japanese group said in a statement that it had been unable to extend talks surrounding the agreement beyond a Jan. 21 closing date. First announced in 2021, the tie-up would have brought together two media powerhouses in India during a time of rising competition in the country.\n\nBut Sony told Reuters that unspecified closing conditions of the merger were \"not satisfied,\" adding that it was \"extremely disappointed\" but committed to growing its presence in India.\n\nZee, meanwhile, revealed in a securities filing that Sony was seeking a termination fee of $90 million and \"emergency interim reliefs.\" It refuted Sony's claims and vowed to take \"all necessary steps to safeguard the long-term interests of its stakeholders,\" including by taking legal action.\n\nReports suggested that the two companies were at odds over the leadership of the combined group, with Sony in particular refusing to allow Zee Chief Executive Punit Goenka take the helm of the business. However, Zee said on Monday that Goenka was \"agreeable to step down in the interest of the merger.\"\n\n5. Oil edges up\n\nOil prices moved higher on Monday, as worries about global crude demand were offset by ongoing geopolitical fears.\n\nBy 05:23 ET, the U.S. crude futures had risen 0.2% to $73.38 a barrel, while the Brent contract had climbed 0.2% to $78.68 per barrel.\n\nThe demand outlook remains muted. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Internal Energy Agency and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries all expect demand for crude to slow this year. Analysts have also flagged that growth in the U.S. -- the world's top oil consumer -- is expected to have decelerated in the fourth quarter.\n\nCounterbalancing these downward pressures on prices was continued violence in the Middle East over the weekend, with the U.S. striking another anti-ship missile being prepared to launch by Yemen-based Houthi militants into the Gulf of Aden. Attacks in the region, a crucial artery for shipping between Europe and Asia, have recently threatened to disrupt global trade by causing many firms to divert vessels away from the area.\n\nElsewhere, Ukraine allegedly carried out a drone attack on a Russian fuel export terminal over the weekend. Russian energy company Novatek said it had been forced to suspend some operations at the site due to a fire, Reuters reported.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, FAA recommends more Boeing safety checks - what's moving markets\n\nBrazil's economy to cool this year amid fiscal tug of war - Reuters poll\n\nFutures signal more steam in S&P 500 after record high",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. co-founder Jensen Huang celebrated the new year with staff during his first trip to China in four years, a low-key tour that coincided with growing concerns about Beijing’s ability to get around US chip restrictions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlorida Governor DeSantis Drops Out of 2024 Race, Endorses Trump Hedge Funds Rake in Huge Profits Betting on Catastrophe Risk Trump Retires ‘DeSanctimonious’ Insult After DeSantis Backs Him Gloom Over China Assets Is Spreading Beyond Battered Stocks Putin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union\n\nHe visited Nvidia’s offices in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing earlier this month, according to a person familiar with the matter. Images and video of the 60-year-old donning colorful traditional garb and dancing with staff emerged online over the weekend. It wasn’t clear if he’d held formal meetings with other executives or officials, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing a private visit.\n\nHuang embarked on his tour — first reported by state newspapers off Chinese social media posts — as Nvidia’s artificial intelligence accelerators become pivotal in a tech race between Washington and Beijing. Huang has warned that an escalation in sanctions designed to cut off the flow of AI training chips could drive Chinese firms to develop their own alternatives. That could harm American tech leaders in the long run, he has said. The Nvidia co-founder name-checked Huawei Technologies Co. — which in 2023 alarmed Washington by including an advanced made-in-China processor in a smartphone — as a potential rival.\n\nRead More: US Looking Into Nvidia’s AI Chips for China, Raimondo Says\n\nAn Nvidia representative confirmed Huang had celebrated the upcoming Lunar New Year with staff, without elaborating.\n\nNvidia, which more than tripled its market value in 2023 thanks largely to its pivotal role in AI development, is up another 20% this year as investors bet on its sector leadership. It’s designed versions of its semiconductors for China that it says are compliant with successive rounds of US sanctions, as Washington watches closely.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong the social media posts, one person describing himself as an Nvidia staffer shared an image of Huang handing over a raffled Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card. The CEO has since moved on to Taiwan, according to local newspaper EDN, for his fourth visit to the island in less than a year.\n\nRead more: Nvidia’s Red-Hot 2024 Start a Bright Spot as S&P 500 Eyes Record\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Roar Higher in 2024: 2 Revolutionary AI Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "The past isn't exactly a crystal ball. But sometimes, a look back in time can offer us clues about what might happen in the future. You can apply this to investing by looking back at an index's past performance and noticing patterns that may repeat themselves today or in the future. And by doing this right now, you'll see history calls for the Nasdaq Composite to roar higher in 2024.\n\nSince the index's launch in the early 1970s, as part of every rebound from an annual decline, it's gained for at least two consecutive years. And after each annual loss of 10% or more, the Nasdaq climbed an average of 56% over those two years. Considering the Nasdaq advanced 43% last year, if the index follows its routine of the past, it could be heading for another double-digit increase in 2024.\n\nHow could you as an investor benefit from a soaring Nasdaq? By investing in companies that contribute the most to the index's movement -- such as the top 10 most heavily weighted in the index -- and then narrowing that down to companies offering exciting growth prospects now. And that brings me to two companies set to lead in artificial intelligence (AI), a market forecast to reach more than $1.3 trillion by 2030. Let's check out two revolutionary AI stocks to buy before the Nasdaq rockets higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) started out by conquering the gaming and graphics marketplaces thanks to its graphics processing units (GPU) -- and that's driven earnings gains over time. But in recent years, the rest of the world discovered the power of GPUs, and Nvidia's sales and share price have taken off.\n\nThese powerful chips handle multiple tasks at the same time, by dividing the work among many processors, and as a result, they significantly speed things up. And that makes Nvidia's GPUs an essential AI tool, serving as the engine for the \"deep learning\" involved in generative AI. As a result, industries from healthcare to automotive are turning to Nvidia chips to drive their AI programs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Nvidia's revenue soared to a record of $18 billion, led by record data center revenue -- the business that benefits from the booming AI market. Data center revenue surged 279% to more than $14 billion. Operating income of $10 billion well surpassed operating expenses, another positive point -- and at the same time, increasing research and development spending shows Nvidia is investing to stay ahead of the crowd.\n\nThe important metrics of free cash flow and return on invested capital have climbed over the past year, proof Nvidia is deploying its cash wisely and benefiting from those investments. NVDA Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nToday, Nvidia holds more than 80% of the GPU market, and though rivals have multiplied, I'm confident this leader will continue to dominate. That's because the company has the first-to-market advantage and a top product, and loyal fans of Nvidia's GPU performance may not be tempted to switch.\n\nA trend in the central processing unit (CPU) market illustrates this. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has grown its share in the CPU market for laptops to 22% over the period of a decade, according to Statista -- but, during that time, it hasn't been able to unseat leader Intel, which holds 69% of the market. All of this means AMD, also present in the GPU market, could gain in share over time -- but without necessarily disturbing Nvidia's dominance.\n\nYes, Nvidia shares have soared in recent times, but the company's earnings growth, market leadership, and key role in AI means there's plenty of room for gains. And a stock market environment favoring growth also should favor Nvidia, making it a top stock to buy before the Nasdaq soars.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is central to our daily lives thanks to its popular search engine, Google. The company generates most of its revenue by selling ads to those who aim to get our attention as we search for various types of information online. Advertisers flock to Alphabet because Google, as you probably could guess, dominates the search market. It's consistently held more than 90% share, and for two big reasons, I wouldn't expect that to change.\n\nFirst, it's hard to change a routine -- and that means most of us are likely to keep \"Googling\" our questions rather than try out a rival search engine. So, Alphabet here has a moat, or competitive advantage that could keep it ahead.\n\nSecond, Alphabet has been significantly investing in AI to make its search capabilities better and better -- this should please us, the users, and as a result we'll keep coming back. And that means advertisers will keep coming back to Alphabet too.\n\nThe company recently announced a big step forward along its AI path when it launched Gemini, its biggest and most high-performing AI model yet. Gemini operates across information types, from text to code and image and video. And Gemini models -- in three different sizes -- tackle various tasks including answering questions on complex topics and generating code in popular programing languages.\n\nIt's clear Gemini could improve the Google Search experience and search results down the road, ensuring Alphabet's dominance. And Alphabet also is adding Gemini to its other products -- such as its Pixel smartphone -- and making Gemini available to its cloud customers. So, this AI tool could be a game-changer for Alphabet as it improves the performance of the company's products and services and allows cloud clients to benefit from the technology.\n\nOn top of this, Alphabet already has a solid track record of earnings growth over time. And the company managed to maintain quarterly revenue increases last year even as advertisers cut back on spending. In the most recent quarter, Alphabet reported an 11% increase in revenue and gains in operating income and earnings per share.\n\nAll of this means if the Nasdaq rockets higher in 2024, AI giant Alphabet could be among stocks leading the way.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Investors to Follow on Twitter and Social Media.\n\nMorgan Stanley Bullish on Diversified, Alpha Hedge Fund Portfolios\n\nOn December 31, 2023, Morgan Stanley reported that falling inflation levels are expected to be sluggishly above bank targets ahead of 2024. Such may lead to price dispersion and provide hedge fund alpha opportunities across asset classes. Throughout 2024, the Fed is expected to ease monetary policy which may eventually push wide discrepancies among winners and losers. While an easing cycle coupled with higher interest rates may increase volatility in bond prices, hedge funds may be able to benefit from higher interest rates, especially with derivative-based investing strategies. Morgan Stanley is bullish on diversified and alpha hedge fund portfolios in the current environment. The market is uncertain and the outlook for 2024 seems unclear, which may be a hint towards avoiding big and risky bets.\n\nTop Stock Picks of Hedge Funds\n\nInstitutional investors are heavily positioned in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc.

To commence with our research we first established certain parameters to define a niche for our list. Therefore, our list consists of popular hedge fund managers that primarily own a Twitter account, and other social media channels if available. We first consulted four reports on the internet including Forbes, Benzinga, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance. We then applied certain filters on LinkedIn using keywords such as \"hedge fund manager\" to ensure we did not miss any important names. Finally, we also looked up founding members and owners of popular hedge funds. This thorough process enabled us to come up with 55 hedge fund managers. We then conducted a manual search to find the Twitter account of every investor along with other social media such as LinkedIn and Instagram, if available. Moreover, we consulted Forbes to extract profiles and the net worth of each investor.\n\nIt is to be noted that while we intended to include hedge fund managers with a significant social media presence, some of the most popular names in the hedge fund industry do not own Twitter accounts. For such investors, we have ranked them earlier in the list based on their social media presence on any other social media site such as Linkedin, Instagram, or YouTube.

        "title": "Why America’s controls on sales of AI tech to China are so leaky",
        "content": "GINA RAIMONDO seemed frustrated when she took the stage at the Reagan National Defence Forum in California in December. The Department of Commerce, which she leads, had just tightened restrictions on the sale of American semiconductors to China. But Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, had immediately started developing a new, slightly less powerful artificial-intelligence (AI) chip for the Chinese market, to which the restrictions would not apply. “If you redesign a chip…that enables [China] to do AI, I’m going to control it the very next day,” Ms Raimondo warned.\n\nThat was bombastic, given that it had taken her department a full year to rework the restrictions to cut off Nvidia’s previous workaround. But America’s five-year campaign against Chinese technology is intensifying. Earlier this month it was reported that Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, and two fellow chip bosses had been summoned to testify in Congress about their Chinese business. On January 19th ABB, a Swiss industrial group, revealed that American lawmakers were investigating its links with China. ABB said it was co-operating with the investigation; Nvidia has said that it is working closely with the government to ensure compliance with the export controls.\n\nNeither Democrats nor Republicans are likely to relent. In a presidential-election year Joe Biden, the unpopular Democratic president, cannot afford to look weak on China. His Republican predecessor and main rival, Donald Trump, has long been America’s China-basher-in-chief. China hawks in Washington want to stymie Chinese efforts both to get around the rules and to recreate the necessary technological capabilities at home. However, the mixed record of export controls so far shows why harsher measures will be difficult to design—and not necessarily more successful.\n\nChina has found some ways to work around the existing controls. To Ms Raimondo’s chagrin, for instance, it is possible to train AI models using chips that are not necessarily at the cutting edge, so long as you have enough of them. If the sale of any chip which can “do AI” is to be banned, as she implies, America must restrict the flow of a much broader array of chips to China.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is hard to know just how much broader. Trade statistics do not break out the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train and run AI models from the larger flow of integrated circuits. But a sense of the scale of such a ban can be gleaned by examining the financial statements of Nvidia, which sells a range of GPUs. It has earned between 21% and 26% of its revenues from China over the past few years. In the nine months to October the company took in $8.4bn from the Chinese market. Almost all of Nvidia’s products can be used to “do AI”. Mr Huang has said that his firm has no “contingency” for being cut off from China.\n\nAnother difficulty for America stems from enforcement. The Department of Commerce is empowered to punish any transgressions it discovers. Last year it fined Seagate, a hard-drive manufacturer, $300m for allegedly breaching export controls by sending components to Huawei, a blacklisted Chinese tech champion. But it is the chip firms themselves that are largely responsible for enforcement. That includes ensuring that their customers are not, in fact, a buying front for Chinese entities with which trade is prohibited. This is hard. “You have coin-sized devices and technologies that are widely commercially available, and indistinguishable from the controlled technologies, distributed around the planet,” says Kevin Wolf, an American lawyer and former official.\n\nThe result is a situation ripe for smuggling, which experts say is impossible to quantify but doubtless rife. It also encourages transshipment. Firms in countries that have not signed on to the American export-control regime, like Singapore, can buy chips and send them on to Chinese entities without the knowledge of the American firms or the Department of Commerce. Nvidia’s most recent quarterly earnings for 2023 show that its sales to Singapore grew by a factor of five over the same period in 2022, faster than anywhere else.\n\nOf all customers in China, the one best placed to use such workarounds to get the chips it needs is the People’s Liberation Army. If one of America’s main aims is to deny China access to advanced technology for developing military AI, it is probably failing. Instead the controls are raising the costs to Chinese buyers of acquiring American AI chips. That in turn is aligning China’s tech sector with its government’s policy of indigenous technological development. Chinese tech giants used to prefer buying higher-quality American technology to investing in research and development. Their incentives have changed.\n\nThe clearest evidence that this is happening comes from Huawei. The company, whose core business is making telecoms gear, was first targeted by America in 2019 for allegedly breaching sanctions on Iran. A measure called the “foreign direct product rule” (FDPR) cut Huawei off from any chips that had been produced using American technology (which is to say virtually all sophisticated ones). In 2022 the FDPR was deployed against the entire Chinese AI industry, and broadened in October to encompass a wider range of AI chips and chipmaking tools, and to require licences to ship products to countries such as the United Arab Emirates (albeit not Singapore) that are thought to serve as middlemen for Chinese buyers.\n\nBefore it was blacklisted, Huawei had its microprocessors manufactured by TSMC, a Taiwanese contract chipmaker. It spent $5.4bn on TSMC-made chips in 2020, before America’s export controls extended to the Taiwanese firm. Now it is doing more business with SMIC, China’s biggest chipmaker. SMIC’s capabilities were thought to be many years behind those of TSMC. But last year it came to light that the company was making a Huawei-designed AI chip, the Ascend (and a smartphone chip, the Kirin, which raised many Western eyebrows after Huawei unexpectedly launched a handset containing it in September).\n\nWith their access to foreign chips curtailed, Chinese AI companies are now turning to Huawei and SMIC for chips. China’s government is encouraging them, and continuing to shower the industry with subsidies in the hope of creating an industry to rival Nvidia and other American companies. Export controls have, in effect, forced China to embrace import substitution.\n\nThe designers of America’s controls foresaw some of this. That is why, from the start, they also targeted China’s ability to recreate advanced technology at home. The controls restrict trade not just in chips themselves but also in tools used to make them. That has involved bringing on board allies such as the Netherlands and Japan, home to many of the toolmakers. As with chips, the tool controls place limits on the sophistication of the equipment that can be sold to Chinese buyers. And as with chips, just how sophisticated a tool has to be to fall under the controls has been the subject of intense debate.\n\nThe critical machines are those used to etch transistors onto silicon wafers. The most cutting-edge equipment of this sort is made and sold exclusively by ASML, a Dutch company, and has been blocked from China for years. But older generations of such lithography tools can still be sold there. ASML’s sales to China have grown dramatically over the past year, as have those of companies that produce other chipmaking tools. In the most recent quarter Chinese sales made up almost half of ASML’s total revenue. Other toolmakers also sell lots of their wares to China (see chart).\n\nBut, as with chips, export controls are giving Chinese toolmakers a strong incentive to invest in catching up technologically with foreign rivals. Already domestic toolmakers’ sales are growing. On January 15th one of them, NAURA, which manufactures other etching tools, said it expected its revenue to have risen by almost 50% in 2023.\n\nAmerica’s campaign against Chinese technology may, then, be both ineffective and counterproductive. Ineffective, because China is adept at exploiting loopholes. And counterproductive, because it is leading to the creation of a more sophisticated Chinese industry. It may also be predicated on a wrong assumption: that the future economic and military balance of power depends on AI, and that AI depends on computing power. “Both of these are guesses,” points out Chris Miller, a historian of technology at Tufts University in Boston. It is far from clear that AI will have strategic importance. And even if it does, computing power may not be the overriding factor in its development. As Mr Miller points out, oomph is expensive, so AI developers will try to use it as sparingly as possible.\n\nDespite all this, America seems likely to toughen up its export controls on ai chips, as Ms Raimondo all but promised in December. And Republican lawmakers are eyeing more expansive controls still. Some of them see a new threat coming from the other end of the sophistication spectrum, which is less about China’s techno-military might and more about its economic power. Chips are required in growing volumes as components in everything from electric vehicles and heat pumps to electricity grids. By 2027 China could be making almost 40% of such semiconductors, reckons TrendForce, a research firm. The current export controls do nothing to curb China’s dominance of this business, which uses a lot of older American technology.\n\nThree congressional Republicans, Mike Gallagher, Elise Stefanik and Michael McCaul, are thus working on a bill which will force the commerce department to cut China off from all American chip technology, not just the most advanced stuff. Gaining support from allies for such an extreme policy will be hard. Japanese and Dutch businesses—and their governments—rankle even at the porous controls that are in place today. But if Mr Trump, an alliance sceptic, returns to power, the lack of support is unlikely to matter one bit.\n\n© 2024 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

        "title": "3 Stocks You Can Confidently Buy After a Market Downturn",
        "content": "2023 was a year of recovery after an economic downturn in 2022 triggered a dramatic sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33%. The challenging period highlighted vulnerabilities in many companies' business models as they suffered repeated revenue declines.\n\nHowever, macroeconomic headwinds also showcased the strength of companies that successfully navigated the market downturn. In 2023, the Nasdaq Composite rose more than 40%, driven by growth from a few key stocks.\n\nTech stocks have played a crucial role in the market's recovery, as advances in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing made Wall Street particularly bullish. Tech is one of the most reliable industries, with its stocks never down for long. As a result, the period after a market downturn could be one of the best times to invest in the lucrative industry.\n\nHere are three stocks you can confidently buy after a market downturn.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nShares in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) plummeted 50% in 2022 as spikes in inflation curbed consumer spending in the PC market and other areas of tech. However, the company delivered an impressive turnaround last year when its shares soared around 240%.\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia's hardware can be found powering a wide range of devices and systems from cloud platforms to artificial intelligence (AI) models, video game consoles, laptops, custom-built PCs, and more. Demand for these products is rarely down for long. Consequently, a market downturn could be the perfect time to buy Nvidia's stock at a bargain and reap the rewards over the long term.\n\nNvidia's business model is diverse. However, its biggest growth catalyst for now is likely AI. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia has achieved a powerful role in the sector with its graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips necessary to train and run AI models. In 2023, Nvidia's GPUs became the preferred chips for AI developers worldwide, leading to soaring earnings. In the third quarter of 2024 (ending October 2023), the company posted revenue growth of 206% year over year as operating income rose 1,600% thanks to soaring chip sales.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. That figure, multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45, implies a potential stock price of $1,080. If projections are correct, its stock will rise 95% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nThe company has come back strong after a market downturn, making its stock an excellent long-term investment.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) e-commerce business was also hit hard by macroeconomic headwinds in 2022. Consumer pullback led to steep declines in retail profits and a tumbling stock price. However, the company's performance last year proved why it's one of the most reliable stock investments over the long term, as it strategically brought its business back to growth.\n\nPoor market conditions led Amazon to introduce a range of cost-cutting measures, such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, laying off thousands of employees, and sunsetting unprofitable divisions like Amazon Care. The restructuring paid off, as the company's free cash flow has soared 427% over the last year.\n\nAmazon's ability to successfully navigate economically challenging conditions makes it an excellent option after a market downturn. The company is using its significant cash reserves to invest in AI and its highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company's price-to-sales ratio currently sits at an attractive 2.8, indicating its stock is trading at a value and is a no-brainer right now.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is not only a great option after a market downturn, but also during one. MSFT Chart\n\nIn 2022, while companies across tech felt the pangs of poor market conditions, Microsoft was not unscathed. However, the chart above shows that it was one of the few to still outperform the Nasdaq Composite, experiencing more moderate declines than many of its rivals.\n\nThe company's greater focus on the commercial and digital markets, such as productivity software and cloud computing, made it less vulnerable to economic declines than its peers.\n\nMoreover, in 2023, the company's shares shot up 57% as it emerged as one of the principal names in AI. Heavy investment in the market has seen Microsoft achieve a 49% stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which granted it exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry.\n\nMicrosoft has so far used OpenAI's tech to bring AI upgrades across its product lineup, including Bing, Azure, and its popular Office productivity programs. The massive user base for these platforms could see the company become the go-to for consumers and businesses everywhere looking to boost efficiency with AI.\n\nThe company's stock trades at a premium, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 36. However, with proven reliability and $63 billion in free cash flow, Microsoft has earned its high price tag. It's a screaming buy for anyone looking for a consistent long-term investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "11 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\n\nCan investing in stocks make you rich? This question is rarely posed anymore since data has overwhelmingly proved that investing in the stock markets is one of the best ways to increase your wealth over time. A report in October 2023 by the Wall Street Journal talked about the rise of \"mini-millionaires\" and how the average wealth of American families was increasing, citing data from the Federal Reserve. Mini-millionaires usually make about $150,000 and $250,000 a year. The report said between 2019 and 2022 families in the 80th to 90th percentile of the income distribution saw the biggest rise in their incomes as their median wealth increased by about 69% from 2019 through 2022, adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe report said that over 90% of these families reported owning stocks, either directly or indirectly.\n\nNeedless to say, investing in the stock market is full of crevices. You can't expect to get rich investing in low-quality stocks and random companies with no value. Investing in stocks to become rich involves patience, wise choices and sticking to traditional investing principles. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had in 2000 foreseen the changing trends in the stock market where investors were becoming impatient, expecting to make money without paying attention to the actual fundamentals of companies. But Klarman at the time had also predicted the return of traditional methods of evaluating companies before investing. In his letter to investors Klarman had said:\n\n\"If Paul Harvey's serialized radio program \"The Rest of the Story\" were applied to Wall Street, it would describe the sad denouement of many such \"story\" stocks. The unraveling of the virtuous circle of growth is not pretty, with earnings shortfalls, plunging share prices, employees with under-water options jumping ship, overzealous shareholders receiving margin calls, accounting chicanery exposed, lawsuits filed, and, to come full circle, the final insult of deletion from the relevant major market index. At this time, attractive valuation is not considered a good story. A slow growth or no growth company trading at one half or one third of its underlying value attracts no important constituency of investors. I sometimes joke about the new market valuation rules of thumb: stocks that fail to meet earnings expectations all seem to trade at 10 times reduced earnings, while formerly profitable companies that report losses all seem to trade at five dollars per share. Many investors avoid these stocks precisely because others are staying away. Why would those kind of stocks ever go up, they wonder. Even those of us with value investing in our DNA generally prefer situations with catalysts for the realization of underlying value.\n\nOver time, this will change. At some unknowable future point, the undervaluation of small capitalization stocks lacking exciting growth characteristics will become so gaping that investors will once again be attracted. The point of investing, after all, is not to have a great story to tell; the point of investing is to make money with limited risk. At some point, investors will drop their Pulitzer prize winning story stocks and revisit their attention on the old classics, stocks that make you money because their undervaluation creates a compelling imbalance between risk and return.\"\n\nStory continues Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years\n\nSeth Klarman of Baupost Group\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scoured various analyst reports and interviews to pick 11 stocks that experts believe can make one rich in the next 5-10 years.\n\n11. ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 16\n\nChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) is one of the stocks that can make one rich in the next few years according to Wall Street analysts. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch last year set a $27 price target on the stock. ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT) was trading at $2.11 as of January 4. Here is why the analyst likes the stock:\n\n“Of note, in our view, is that the company’s substantial product development cycle is slowing and management continues to expect material operating leverage as R&D spend moderates. Second, demand continues to be robust as EV sales grow in multiple geographies driving charging infrastructure buildout. Third, the company is well capitalized as it drives toward positive adjusted EBITDA in F2Y4 and manages working capital needs for growth. We remain constructive on shares as we anticipate the company will enjoy both top-line growth and margin expansion in coming quarters.”\n\nIn addition to CHPT, investors are also piling into high quality names like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n10. Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TARS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nBiopharma company Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TARS) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks that will make you rich in the next five to ten years. The average price target for the stock over the next one year is $43.25.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Francois Brisebois, who also has a $43 price target on the stock, explained his bullish thesis on Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TARS) in the following words, according to TipRanks:\n\n“Commercially led by eye care veteran CCO Mottiwala (ex-VP Marketing Allergan Eye Care), TARS is well-positioned to develop a new category, eyelid health. We are particularly encouraged by market research revealing an intent to prescribe for demodex blepharitis (DB) of 93%. As awareness grows, our conviction in TP-03’s market potential is reinforced. Additionally, we believe TP-03 could benefit from key differences between DB and dry eye disease (DED) markets. Finally, although we currently don’t value TARS’ pipeline, we believe it should not be dismissed and see multiple opportunities for growth and monetization.”\n\n9. AES Corp (NYSE:AES)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nUtility company AES Corp (NYSE:AES) ranks 9th in our list of the best stocks that will make you rich in the next 5 to 10 years according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nSarat Sethi, DCLA managing partner, believes the stock AES Corp (NYSE:AES) has strong earnings growth potential for the next three to five years. The analyst also praised the stock’s dividend yield.\n\nMassif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Given interest rates’ elevated state, it is perhaps unsurprising that our utility exposure has fared poorly for us this year. We should have hedged the exposure sooner with a Utility ETF short, but we did not do that until the third quarter, after much of the damage was already done. As noted above, our Utility exposure is second only to our materials exposure in terms of negative impact on the portfolio across both the third quarter and the YTD periods. This is primarily driven by our investment in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), which was down roughly 26% in the third quarter and 47% YTD. Our other utility exposure is up for the year, including our short position, which, as noted, was put on in the third quarter, and it is probably something we should have had on the books for the entire year.\n\nWe attribute, for right or wrong, the entirety of the sell-off in AES to the interest rate environment. Chart overlays are always tricky, so one should not read too much into them, but as a quick sense check of the claim, if one inverts the move-in rates for a generic 10-year US government bond and overlay it with AES stock price YTD, you get the following:..” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n8. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 68\n\nSarat Sethi of DCLA managing partner likes Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) as a stock to buy and hold for the next few years because of its strong cash flow, growing dividend and a “very strong management team.”\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The most significant stake ($1.42 billion) in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is owned by Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”\n\n7. Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 73\n\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) is one of the stocks that has the potential to gain a lot in value over the next few years, according to Sarat Sethi, DCLA managing partner. The analyst said while talking to CNBC that Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) is set to gain on the back of an increase in demand for EVs and copper.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the company. Like FCX, hedge funds are loading up on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is perhaps one of the most divisive stocks out there, with some analysts saying the stock will fall while others saying the stock would skyrocket.\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Invest believes Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could hit $2000 by 2027. Wedbush's Dan Ives, who is also a notable Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull, recently said in a program on CNBC that there are signs that demand for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles remains strong. He said that it’s important to differentiate between demand trends in the broader EV industry and demand for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles. In addition to Tesla, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the top stocks hedge funds and Wall Street analysts are buying.\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Best Get Rich Quick Stocks To Buy 13 Cash-Rich Small Cap Stocks To Invest In 15 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5 Years According to ChatGPT,\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Every portfolio should have some \"forever\" stocks -- companies so good that they're worth holding for a very, very long time.\n\nThey're like keepsakes -- oftentimes passed down from parent to child. They can be the bedrock of true generational wealth. So, what types of stocks fit that bill? Well, let's have a look at three that I consider forever stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nTech giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a mainstay of my investment portfolio and will remain so for many years to come, for three key reasons.\n\nRelentless focus on the customer: This was the creed of founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, and it still permeates the company today. Look no further than the company's mission statement: \"Amazon's mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company.\" Innovation: Amazon has developed numerous innovations, ranging from its sprawling fulfillment network to its vast array of data centers that make it the global leader in cloud computing services. Delivering shareholder value: The company constantly reevaluates its finances and workforce, with a focus on balancing shareholder returns and reinvestment in the business. Over the last 10 years, Amazon shares have returned 659%, meaning a $10,000 investment in early 2014 would be worth nearly $76,000 as of this writing. AMZN Total Return Level Chart\n\nAMZN Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nIn short, Amazon is a great company. What's more, with analysts expecting it to grow sales by 11% this year as its long-term investments in regional distribution combine with a rebound in enterprise cloud spending.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nNext up is Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), the legendary maker of iconic beverage brands such as Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Fanta, Schweppes, and Minute Maid, among many others.\n\nThe reason I intend to own Coca-Cola stock forever is that the company delivers consistent earnings growth. Over the last five years, Coca-Cola has grown its net income from $6.7 billion to $10.8 billion. Quarterly earnings per share (EPS) have increased at an average rate of 19%. Moreover, free cash flow -- the lifeblood of a mature, dividend-paying company -- has grown from $6.0 billion to more than $10.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat, in turn, has allowed Coca-Cola to increase its dividend consistently. In fact, the company has raised its dividend each year, dating back 62 years -- representing one of the longest such streaks on Wall Street.\n\nAnd what a dividend it is! The company pays $1.84 per share -- good for a dividend yield of 3.1% at the current share price. That's more than twice the 1.4% average yield of the S&P 500 index.\n\nTo see how important those dividend payments are over the long term, consider this chart which shows the growth of a $10,000 investment in Coca-Cola over the last 30 years. KO Chart\n\nThe company's steadily growing payouts make an enormous difference, boosting the total return of the investment from $56,000 to more than $116,000 (with dividend reinvestment).\n\nIn short, Coca-Cola remains a solid stock that investors can rely on for the very long-term -- a nearly perfect forever stock.\n\nNvidia\n\nFinally, there's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The reason to own Nvidia forever is simple: Technology is the future.\n\nNever has this been more obvious than right now. Whether it's artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving, advanced robotics, or gene editing, it's clear that the next wave of technological breakthroughs will have one thing in common: They will require tremendous amounts of computing power.\n\nThat means demand for advanced semiconductors -- the type used in the supercomputers and server farms of today and tomorrow -- will continue to grow massively in the years to come.\n\nNvidia, which many experts believe makes the best and fastest chips for high-performance computing, stands to benefit enormously from the rise of AI and other cutting-edge tech innovations.\n\nThat's why Wall Street analysts are raising their forecasts for its future sales at a breakneck pace. The consensus among analysts is that Nvidia will report over $92 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2025. Over the last 12 months, it reported $45 billion in revenues.\n\nNevertheless, Nvidia isn't a perfect forever stock for everyone. Income-seeking investors will be better off looking elsewhere, as will value-oriented investors and those who lack the stomach for stocks with high volatility.\n\nHowever, for long-term investors who a ready to hold on through the inevitable volatility, Nvidia is a forever stock with a high ceiling, and one worth seriously considering.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy in January",
        "content": "Fueling the main narrative for undervalued tech stocks to buy in January is the rotation principle. With the usual suspects still garnering much attention, it’s tempting to continue riding the same horse. However, a better idea may be to consider innovators that just haven’t received much attention.\n\nFor example, everyone seemingly loves talking about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and for good reason. In the trailing 52 weeks, NVDA skyrocketed over 227%. However, in the past half-year period, the equity unit gained about 21%. It’s still a decent performance but it appears investors are getting leery about its forward prospects.\n\nOn the other hand, the technology players that fell by the wayside as Nvidia stormed to new heights may be attractively de-risked. For speculators, these ideas could see blue skies ahead. With that, below are the undervalued tech stocks to buy this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. semiconductor stocks to buy and hold\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA semiconductor specialist focused on advanced microchips, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) provides critical services to multiple industries. However, as a stagehand manager if you will, it doesn’t quite get the attention it deserves. Still, that makes the enterprise an intriguing idea for undervalued tech stocks. In the past 52 weeks, STM only gained about 8%, possibly suggesting room for additional upside.\n\nMainly, the bullish narrative centers on its broad relevancies. For example, one of ST’s bread-and-butter businesses is providing semiconductors to automotive manufacturers. These chips cover various applications such as powertrain management, safety systems, and advanced drive-assistance systems, among others. Better yet, the auto semiconductor market could print revenue of $77.76 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% from 2023.\n\nJust as well, STM trades at only 12.53X forward earnings, below the sector median of 21.69X. Further, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) stands at nearly 31%, reflecting effectiveness in generating profitable investments. Lastly, analysts rate shares as a consensus strong buy with a $50.75 average price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nBelden (BDC) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nA global enterprise specializing in the design, manufacture and distribution of end-to-end networking and connectivity productions and solutions, Belden (NYSE:BDC) offers wide relevancies. Whether targeting industrial automation, smart buildings or 5G integration, Belden brings innovative solutions to the table. Despite its strengths, BDC slipped more than 5% in the past 52 weeks. That might change, making BDC one of the undervalued tech stocks to consider.\n\nHow can investors be confident in the bullish narrative? Mainly, it has to do with the underlying Network as a Service (NaaS) industry. According to Grand View Research, the global NaaS space reached a valuation of $6.67 billion in 2021. However, by 2030, the sector could print revenue of $81.82 billion. If so, that would translate to a CAGR of 32.9%.\n\nAs the market that Belden serves gets stronger, BDC should receive downwind benefits. In the meantime, shares trade for only 13.19X forward earnings, below the sector median of 16X. In closing, analysts peg shares as a unanimous strong buy with an $87.50 price target.\n\nInterDigital (IDCC) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks.\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nA technology research and development company, InterDigital (NASDAQ:IDCC) provides wireless and video technologies for mobile devices, networks, and services worldwide. Per its public profile, InterDigital features a portfolio of about 32,000 U.S. and foreign-issued patents and patent applications. Tremendously relevant, those in the know bid up IDCC to a return of nearly 69% in the past 52 weeks. Even better, it remains a candidate for undervalued tech stocks.\n\nFundamentally, the company could see robust gains through its wireless technology licensing business. With its intellectual property (IP) covering technologies used in connected devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), InterDigital commands a large addressable market. For example, Precedence Research estimates that the global IoT space reached a valuation of $320.9 billion in 2022. By 2032, the sector could hit over $1.56 trillion, resulting in a CAGR of 17.2%.\n\nNotably, IDCC trades at a mere 19X forward earnings, favorably below 60.8% of its peers. Yet its ROIC clocks in at an impressive 22.86%. In the past seven months, all four analysts who covered IDCC rated it a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Semiconductor Secrets: 7 Chip Stocks to Buy Instead of Nvidia",
        "content": "Though the dominance of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is unquestioned – especially with the rising prominence of generative artificial intelligence – it’s also worth pointing out that other chip stocks exist. Now, they might not offer the radical paradigm shift that NVDA sparked last year. Frankly, it’s difficult to make lightning strike twice. However, from a value proposition, other compelling semiconductor stocks might make more sense.\n\nFor example, Nvidia continues to rise higher on the burgeoning AI ecosystem, which its graphics processing units (GPUs) undergird. Since the start of the year, NVDA gained almost 19% of equity value. And in the past 52 weeks, it’s up nearly 241%. However, in the trailing six months, shares have only moved up 18%. What does that tell us? Basically, like a fine-tuned athlete, incremental gains in performance are difficult to extract.\n\nOn the other hand, less-fancied chip stocks are like amateur athletes. That’s not to cast aspersions but rather to point out that when you’re less trained, you can extract massive performance gains. Put another way, it’s the last few pounds that are the most difficult to lose.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, Nvidia may have a “last-mile problem” while these semiconductor stocks might not – enjoy!\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want the closest thing to an Nvidia without buying NVDA stock, you’ll need to look at Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). To be sure, the semiconductor specialist has printed a powerful performance in its own right. In the trailing one-year period, AMD gained 140% of equity value. It’s awesome – just not 241% awesome. That could make Advanced Micro an intriguing idea for chip stocks to buy.\n\nFor one thing, the underlying generative AI market relevance has already been established. Plus, Advanced Micro has a knack for offering top-tier products at a discount to its rivals. Moving forward, a report by Bloomberg notes that the underlying sector could become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. If so, that would translate to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the spirit of full disclosure, AMD isn’t the cheapest of semiconductor stocks. With a forward earnings multiple of almost 43X, investors must think carefully. Nevertheless, as stated above, the relevance has been proven. Thus, the most bullish analyst anticipates a target of $200.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn enticing and relevant example of chip stocks to buy for the long haul, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) deserves consideration for its wide pertinence, particularly in the realm of connectivity. It’s a leading provider of smartphone processors globally, with its Snapdragon series of chipsets powering the most high-end Android phones on the market. Analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy.\n\nPart of what makes QCOM one of the compelling semiconductor stocks to buy is the total addressable market. Per Grand View Research, the global 5G services market reached a valuation of $60.61 billion in 2022. By 2030, experts project that the segment may hit a value of over $2.2 trillion. If so, that would translate to a CAGR of 59.4%.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the company’s value proposition relative to the competition. Specifically, QCOM trades at a forward earnings multiple of 15.23X, favorably below 72.39% of its peers. On average, analysts anticipate QCOM reaching $149.39 per share, with the high-side target possibly hitting $173.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) develops and produces semiconductors and related technology. In particular, Marvell is a leader in high-performance networking and storage solutions. As a result, it’s one of the chip stocks poised to benefit from burgeoning arenas such as 5G networks. Analysts unsurprisingly rate shares a consensus strong buy (just one voice short of unanimous).\n\nIn addition, Marvell also provides solutions for data centers and cloud computing. Just regarding the former category, the global underlying sector reached a valuation of $192.63 billion in 2021. Experts believe that by 2030, the segment could see a value of $554.4 billion, representing a double-digit CAGR. As for the latter, cloud computing could be worth $1.44 trillion by 2029.\n\nTo be fair, MRVL trades at a rather hot forward multiple of 32.48X. That said, the company enjoys a robust three-year revenue growth rate of 20.3%. Also, the most bullish analyst anticipates MRVL reaching $100 per share. Therefore, it’s a worthy inclusion among semiconductor stocks to consider.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nEasily one of the most relevant chip stocks you can buy, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is a multinational contract manufacturing and design company. Per its public profile, TSMC as it’s known is the world’s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry. Simply stated, a foundry means that the business makes chips for other companies. Analysts peg shares as a consensus strong buy.\n\nAccording to Allied Market Research, the global semiconductor foundry sector reached a value of $106.9 billion in 2022. Experts anticipate that by 2032, the ecosystem could be worth $231.5 billion. If so, that would come out to a CAGR of 8.1% from 2023. Even better for TSM, the underlying company dominates the space. In the third quarter of 2023, TSMC secured a 57.9% foundry revenue market share.\n\nEnticingly, TSM is much more attractive than many other semiconductor stocks. While printing a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 32.8%, it also offers a trailing-year earnings multiple of 18.47X. That’s below 66.4% of its peers. The most bullish analyst sees shares hitting $125.\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a multinational semiconductor firm specializing in data conversion, signal processing, and power management technologies. Per its public profile, it manufactures analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal-processing integrated circuits (ICs) used in electronic equipment. As a quietly relevant idea among chip stocks, ADI deserves consideration for those seeking a long-term investment.\n\nBasically, Analog Devices can address multiple in-demand sectors. For example, the company is a key player in the industrial automation ecosystem. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global industrial control and automation sector reached a valuation of $147.9 billion in 2022. By 2027, the segment could hit $218.8 billion, implying a CAGR of 8.2%. Combine this with other covered industries and ADI makes a great play for semiconductor stocks.\n\nOn the financial side, Analog prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 17.3%, beating out 62.1% of its rivals. Unsurprisingly, the company has been consistently profitable over the past 10 years. Analysts rate shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $206.06 price target.\n\nSilicon Motion (SIMO) SIMO stock: Silicon Motion Technology logo on the side of its headquarters\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nAn American-Taiwanese enterprise involved in developing NAND flash controller integrated circuits (ICs) for solid-state storage devices, Silicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) is a major player in storage-related solutions. These include commercial, enterprise and industrial applications ranging from solid-state drives (SSDs), embedded MultiMediaCards (eMMCs), memory cards and USB flash drives. In the past 52 weeks, SIMO slipped more than 2%. Still, it could be an opportunity among underappreciated chip stocks.\n\nAccording to Straits Research, the global NAND flash memory market reached a valuation of $67 billion in 2021. Further, experts project that the segment could hit $117 billion by 2030. If so, that would translate to a CAGR of 6.39% from 2022. Notably, Silicon Motion currently carries a market capitalization of $2.12 billion. In other words, SIMO could soar by biting an appropriately sized chunk of the NAND market.\n\nPer the numbers, Silicon Motion is a growth machine. Specifically, its three-year sales expansion rate clocks in at 29.8%, above 83.2% of its rivals. Also, it’s consistently profitable thanks to its core specialty. Analysts peg shares as a strong buy with an average target of $74.20.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it. Semiconductor stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Arizona, ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) represents a chip supplier. Per its public profile, ON’s products include power and signal management, logic, discrete, and custom devices for multiple applications. These include automotive, communications, computing, consumer, industrial, lighting, and medical, among others. In the past 52 weeks, ON gained more than 15% of equity value. With strong relevancies on tap, it could be one of the top chip stocks to buy.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the key areas that ON serves is the automotive sector. According to MarketsandMarkets, the auto semiconductor market reached a valuation of $42.9 billion in 2022. By 2027, this space could see a value of $70 billion. If so, this would translate to a CAGR of 10.1% from 2022. Combine this narrative with other compelling stories and ON could easily be one of the winning semiconductor stocks for the long haul.\n\nMoving to the financials, the company prints an above-average three-year EBITDA growth rate of 40%. It’s also consistently profitable, making its forward earnings multiple of 14.37X quite credible. Finally, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with an $89.74 price target, implying almost 23% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: My Top 7 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "The macroeconomic challenges of the past couple of years are beginning to fade, and investors are looking to the future. After the Nasdaq Composite plunged in 2022, suffering its worst performance since 2008, the index enjoyed a robust recovery in 2023 and gained 43%.\n\nThere could be more to come. Since the Nasdaq Composite began trading in 1972, in every year following a market recovery, the tech-heavy index rose again -- and those second-year gains averaged 19%. The economy is the wildcard here, though, and it could yet stumble in 2024. But historical patterns suggest that this could be a good year for investors.\n\nRecent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) helped fuel the market's rise last year and will likely drive further gains in 2024. While estimates vary wildly, generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the next few years, according to a study by McKinsey Global Institute. This will result in windfalls for many companies in the field.\n\nHere are my top seven AI stocks to buy for 2024 before the Nasdaq reaches new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster child for AI innovation. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are already the industry standard chips in a growing number of AI use cases -- including data centers, cloud computing, and machine learning -- and it quickly adapted its processors for the needs of generative AI. Though it has been ramping up production, the AI chip shortage is expected to last until 2025 as demand keeps growing. The specter of competition looms, but thus far, Nvidia has stayed ahead of the competition by spending heavily on research and development.\n\nThe company's triple-digit percentage year-over-year growth is expected to continue into 2024. Despite its prospects, Nvidia remains remarkably cheap, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) helped jump-start the AI boom when it invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, shining a spotlight on generative AI. The company's tech peers jumped on the bandwagon, and the AI gold rush began. Microsoft seized the advantage, integrating OpenAI's technology into its Bing search and a broad cross-section of its cloud-based offerings.\n\nIts productivity-enhancing AI assistant, Copilot, could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027, according to some analysts, though estimates vary. This and other AI tools already caused Azure Cloud's growth to outpace rivals in Q3, and Microsoft attributed 3 percentage points of that growth to AI.\n\nThe stock is selling for 35 times forward earnings, a slight premium to the price-to-earnings ratio of 26 for the S&P 500. Even so, that looks attractive given Microsoft's growth potential.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has long used AI to improve its search results and the relevance of its digital advertising. The company was quick to recognize the potential of generative AI, imbuing many of its Google and Android products with increased functionality and announcing plans to add new AI tools to its search product. Furthermore, as the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider, Google Cloud is suited to offer AI systems to its customers.\n\nA collaboration between Google and Alphabet's AI research lab, DeepMind, gave birth to Gemini, which the company bills as its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Google Cloud's Vertex AI offers 130 foundational models that help users build and deploy generative AI apps quickly.\n\nAdd to that the ongoing rebound in its digital advertising business, and Alphabet's valuation of 27 times earnings seems like a steal.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nThere's a popular narrative that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was late to recognize the opportunities in AI, but the company's history tells a different story. Amazon continues to deploy AI to surface relevant products to shoppers, recommend viewing choices on Prime Video, schedule e-commerce deliveries, and predict inventory levels, among other uses. Most recently, Amazon began testing an AI tool designed to answer shoppers' questions about products.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) stocks all the most popular generative AI models for its cloud customers on Bedrock AI, and is also deploying its Inferentia and Trainium purpose-built AI chips for accelerating AI on its infrastructure.\n\nNow that inflation has slowed markedly, more consumers and businesses are patronizing Amazon, and AI will help boost its fortunes. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) also has a long and distinguished history of using AI to its advantage. From identifying and tagging people in photos to surfacing relevant content on its social media platforms, Meta has never been shy about deploying AI systems.\n\nUnlike some of its big tech rivals, Meta doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service to peddle its AI wares, but it quickly developed a workaround. After developing its open-source Llama AI model, Meta made it available on all the major cloud services -- for a price. Furthermore, Meta offers a suite of free AI-powered tools to help advertisers succeed.\n\nImproving economic conditions will no doubt boost its digital advertising business. And with the stock trading at just 22 times forward earnings, Meta is inexpensive relative to its opportunity.\n\n6. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has two decades of experience building AI-powered data analytics, and was ready to meet the challenge when AI went mainstream. In just months, the company added generative AI models to its portfolio, layering these atop its data analytics tools. The launch of the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has generated a lot of excitement. \"Demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past 20 years,\" said management.\n\nWhen fears of a downturn were higher, businesses scaled back on most nonessential spending, including data analytics and AI services, but now, demand for those services is rebounding, particularly in relation to generative AI.\n\nLooking ahead one year, Palantir sports a PEG ratio of less than 1, which helps illustrate how cheap the stock really is.\n\n7. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) made a splash by bringing electric vehicles (EVs) into the mainstream. In 2023, its Model Y topped the list of the world's best-selling cars by a comfortable margin, the first EV to do so. However, the magnitude of its future prosperity will likely be linked to AI. The company's \"full self-drive\" system has yet to live up to its name, but success on that front would be a boon to shareholders.\n\nIn Ark Investment Management's Big Ideas 2023 report, the firm estimates that robotaxis could generate $4 trillion in revenue in 2027. With an estimated 2.7 million vehicles on the road collecting data, Tesla could hold an insurmountable technological edge, if it cracks the code on autonomous driving. Some analysts estimate the software is already worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nFinally, 6 times forward sales is a pretty reasonable valuation for an industry leader with a treasure trove of data.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The Nasdaq Just Did Something It Has Done Only 5 Times Before. History Says a Big Move in Stocks Could Follow in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) is an index comprising about 3,500 stocks, many of which come from the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. To that end, the Nasdaq is often considered a benchmark for growth stocks because many of its components are on the cutting edge of various technologies and consumer trends, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and e-commerce.\n\nInvestors rotated away from growth stocks as post-pandemic inflation scorched the economy. The Nasdaq tumbled deep into bear market territory in 2022, falling as much as 36% from its high.\n\nThat drawdown was largely driven by recession fears arising from aggressive monetary policy. Specifically, the Federal Reserve has battled inflation by raising its benchmark interest rate at its fastest pace since the 1980s. Many economists feared (and some continue to fear) that policymakers could trigger a recession by tightening credit conditions too quickly.\n\nHowever, the Nasdaq shook off those fears and moved higher last year as signs of economic resilience and excitement about artificial intelligence improved market sentiment. The index soared 43.4% in 2023, one of its best performances in history. Prior to that, the Nasdaq had achieved an annual gain exceeding 40% only five times since its inception in 1971.\n\nHistorically, annual gains exceeding 40% have portended more upward momentum in the Nasdaq. Of course, investors should never put too much weight on such forecasts simply because each situation is unique. The last few years have been defined by fallout from a global pandemic, and there is no precedent for such an event. Even so, historical patterns are still worth consideration. Here's what investors should know.\n\nHistory says the Nasdaq could move higher in 2024\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite returned 43.4% in 2023, marking the sixth time the index has increased more than 40% in a calendar year. The chart below shows the last five events and details the Nasdaq's return 12 months later.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear Nasdaq Return Nasdaq Return (12 Months Later) 1991 56.9% 15.5% 1999 85.6% (32.3%) 2003 50% 8.6% 2009 43.9% 16.9% 2020 43.6% 21.4% Median 15.5%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAs shown above, the Nasdaq has returned a median of 15.5% during the 12-month periods following an annual gain exceeding 40%. To add context, the Nasdaq has ticked down about half a percentage point this year, so the implied upside is about 16% through the remainder of 2024.\n\nInvestors should view that number as little more than a guess. The combination of a global pandemic, the fiercest inflation in four decades, and aggressive interest rate hikes make the current situation unique. As such, the Nasdaq may not perform as historical data suggests. But there is one more pattern investors may find interesting.\n\nThe Federal Reserve may be done raising interest rates\n\nThe Federal Reserve has hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be over. In fact, the latest projections from policymakers imply three 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2024. Futures investors are even more optimistic. The CME Group's Fed Watch tool -- which uses pricing data from futures contracts to estimate the probability of future rate hikes and cuts -- currently shows a 70% chance of at least six 25-basis-point cuts in 2024.\n\nIf credit conditions indeed loosen in the coming year, that shift in monetary policy would promote borrowing and spending among businesses and consumers. In turn, that should lead to robust economic expansion and strong growth in corporate revenues and profits. Investors get excited by those prospects, so the Nasdaq has historically risen sharply following the end of interest-rate-hike cycles.\n\nTo elaborate, the Federal Reserve has guided the economy through six rate-hike cycles since 1983. The Nasdaq returned a median of 20% during the 12-month period following the last rate hike in those cycles. For context, the Federal Reserve last increased its benchmark rate on July 27, since which time the Nasdaq has advanced 6%. That leaves implied upside of roughly 14% through July 2024.\n\nOf course, that presupposes that the Federal Reserve is indeed done raising interest rates. But that outcome is not guaranteed. Inflation actually reaccelerated to 3.4% in December, up from 3.1% in November, so policymakers could ultimately decide to tighten credit conditions further.\n\nPatience is key to making money in the stock market\n\nInvestors should avoid strategies based on market timing. Not even the smartest economists and Wall Street strategists know what the year ahead will bring. Some pundits are forecasting the worst crash in decades, while others see only a modest risk of recession. But those concerns become less pressing with a long-term mindset.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell 56% during the bear market that accompanied the Great Recession, and it took more than three years for the index to regain its record high. But the Nasdaq has still gained 424% since the drawdown started. In other words, investors who bought a Nasdaq Composite index fund the day the bear market began have still seen annualized returns of 10.8% during the last 16 years.\n\nThe lesson here is simple: Patience is the key to making money in the stock market. Investors who buy individual stocks should carefully research each company before buying shares, paying close attention to growth prospects and valuation.\n\nCompanies primed to benefit from artificial intelligence are a good place to start. That includes software vendors like Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG), cloud services providers like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and chipmakers like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Those companies are members of the Nasdaq Composite, and all but Datadog rank among its 10 largest components.\n\nAlternatively, investors can save themselves some work with an index fund strategy, either in lieu of or in addition to individual stocks. A Nasdaq Composite index fund like the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite ETF(NASDAQ: ONEQ) would tap directly into the Nasdaq's returns. Investors should also consider an S&P 500 index fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO). Warren Buffett has often recommended that strategy. But no matter the strategy, patience is the key to making money.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Walmart\n\nWhen our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "2024 Prediction: Why IBM Is the AI Stock to Buy and Hold for Magnificent Growth",
        "content": "It's 2024, and the stock market has been fascinated with artificial intelligence (AI) for a full year now. Stocks seen as direct plays on the AI trend have skyrocketed, especially if they have an early lead in some subsector of the AI revolution.\n\nFor instance, shares of AI-chip pioneer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have more than tripled in 52 weeks. AI-based cybersecurity expert CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) soared 177% higher over the same period. Data analytics specialist Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) made a 134% jump, also driven by its AI-powered products and services.\n\nThese AI-focused market darlings float on incredibly rich valuation ratios. The price-to-sales ratios in my sample groups start at 17 times trailing revenue for Palantir, stretching to 31 for Nvidia. Profit-based ratios are even wilder with price-to-free cash flow metrics in the mid-70s. CrowdStrike isn't even profitable in terms of earnings, reinvesting its operating income in growth-boosting AI research and heavy marketing budgets.\n\nYet, the AI surge left a couple of top-notch names behind. In particular, I think it's high time to consider investing in International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) right now. This proven leader in business-grade AI tools never got the memo about soaring stock prices, and its shares look ridiculously undervalued today.\n\nHow IBM missed the AI bandwagon last year\n\nI'm not here to remind you of IBM's illustrious history in AI research. That backdrop gives Big Blue another selling point to pull out in contract negotiations, but most deals aren't won by looking back at years gone by. So instead, let's talk about how IBM is pursuing the AI business today and in the future.\n\nThe IBM you see today bears little resemblance to the one-stop shop for information technology (IT) needs you got used to in the 1990s and early 2000s. The company refocused its considerable assets on so-called strategic imperatives under CEOs Ginni Rometty and Arvind Krishna. Over the years, the themes of cloud computing and AI emerged as the most important of these overarching goals. The company spun off or sold several slow-growth business operations that didn't fit the new mold, resulting in lower top-line sales but robust cash flows.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany investors lost patience with this slow process, starting in 2012 and arguably still ongoing today. IBM's stock price fell more than 40% (not counting a temporary 48% drop in the early coronavirus panic) before starting a modest comeback. Even with the stock at today's multiyear highs, IBM investors have seen a 5% price drop since the end of 2011. The S&P 500 index rose by 277% over the same period, so Big Blue hasn't been a long-term market-beater.\n\nAnd maybe that's why IBM's stock hasn't enjoyed raging gains in the recent AI frenzy. How can this long-term underperformer deliver valuable innovation in this fast-paced technology era?\n\n...or did it?\n\nThat undervaluing is a big mistake in my view. You see, this is where IBM's rubber should hit the road. The company has spent years preparing for exactly this opportunity, quietly building an unmatched portfolio of business-to-business AI tools and services.\n\nFor example:\n\nIBM's Watson AI platform offers cloud-based services in data analysis, natural language processing, deep learning, and more. Based on 70 years of research and customer requests, this system was designed from the ground up to meet the needs of corporate customers. Following the ChatGPT furor, IBM added generative AI functions to its app development and data analytics platform, creating the new Watsonx platform. This system can take IBM's data-processing features, add your own business data, and produce actionable insights with game-changing business value. It's like ChatGPT in a business suit, always carrying a briefcase full of your company's most valuable data. Going forward, IBM benefits from selling its unique AI products to new and existing clients -- but also from helping customers make the most of their new AI tools. \"We are the only provider today that provides an integrated technology IT stack around our Watsonx platform and brings to bear the consulting services expertise to actually help clients deploy and run their GenAI solutions,\" CFO Jim Kavanaugh said at a recent investor conference.\n\nI can only scratch the surface of IBM's vast AI operations in this brief treatise. Many books have been written on this subject and the company receives thousands of AI patents every year, if you're looking for some light bedside reading. But I think it's clear that IBM has started to flex its robust AI muscles, most likely resulting in impressive business results in 2024 and beyond.\n\nEnterprise-class clients may take some time putting new technology solutions though testing, budget approvals, and multilayer management approvals, but there will be consistently lucrative contracts at the end of that Big Blue rainbow.\n\nMarket makers are missing that behind-the-scenes success story so far, which is why IBM's stock only gained 14% over the last year and trades at just 2.5 times sales and 12.6 times free cash flow right now. Lifting these ratios just a little closer to the lofty appraisals of Nvidia, CrowdStrike, and Palantir would result in dramatic price gains -- at long last.\n\nSeizing the AI opportunity with IBM\n\nIBM's journey in the AI landscape has been a story of strategic transformation and undervalued potential. While market darlings have grabbed headlines with soaring valuations, IBM has quietly built a formidable AI arsenal, from the versatile Watson AI platform to the innovative Watsonx system tailored for business applications. This blend of cutting-edge technology and enterprise-focused solutions positions IBM uniquely in the AI domain, and the stock is essentially on fire sale.\n\nIt's an opportunity for investors to back a seasoned tech giant poised for a resurgence in the era of AI, at a valuation that leaves room for significant growth.\n\nAs we move further into 2024, keeping an eye on IBM's progress in deploying its AI solutions and capturing market share will be crucial. For those willing to look beyond the hype, IBM's value-priced stock looks like a smart and low-cost investment choice in the rapidly evolving AI sector.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — The S&P 500 Index set new closing and intraday highs for the first time in two years Friday, capping a stunning rebound from 2022’s violent selloff.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union China’s $6.3 Trillion Stock Selloff Is Getting Uglier by the Day Musk’s AI Startup Secures $500 Million Toward $1 Billion Funding Goal Burger King Is Serving Whoppers With a Side of Cringe Ford Cuts Workforce Making Electric F-150s on Weak Demand\n\nThe resurgence is being powered by the so-called Magnificent Seven technology companies — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — and it’s largely based on investors’ hopes for artificial intelligence and cost-cutting efforts that fueled a profit boom at those firms.\n\nIt’s also getting significant help from a Federal Reserve that appears to be done raising interest rates and starting to consider when to begin cutting after the biggest monetary tightening campaign in decades.\n\nHere’s a look at the S&P 500’s wild round trip:\n\nThe road from a previous record in January 2022 took 512 trading sessions. That’s the longest dry spell in more than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHistorically, however, the 512-day streak isn’t quite as impressive. In the 1970s, the S&P 500 went more than seven years without a record as inflation skyrocketed and growth stagnated.\n\nAfter peaking two years ago, the S&P 500 shed as much as a quarter of its value before hitting a closing low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022. Since then, it has added more than $10 trillion in market value while rebounding from the 2022 selloff, the worst year for the index since the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nThe last rout came as fast-growing tech companies got pummeled by rising interest rates. In addition, Russia’s war with Ukraine created a humanitarian crisis in Europe, oil prices soared past $100 a barrel and parts of the Treasury yield curve inverted.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe information technology, communication services and consumer-discretionary sectors led the S&P 500’s bounce back in 2023. They also house the Magnificent Seven technology companies.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, the seven-largest companies in the S&P 500 outperformed the rest of the index by the most since the dot-com bubble. Apple crossed back above a $3 trillion market capitalization in December after rallying nearly 50% last year.\n\nNvidia, whose stock skyrocketed in 2023 following a massive sales forecast in May that ignited AI excitement, takes the title as top percentage-gain contributor to the S&P 500 since October 2022, rallying over 400%, followed by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Meta and Broadcom Inc.\n\nIn terms of index-point contributions, Microsoft holds the top spot, adding 156.90 points. Nvidia added 141.54 points, while Apple contributed 95.40 points, with Meta and Amazon rounding out the top five.\n\nFirst Republic Bank and SVB Financial Group were the two worst performers in the S&P 500 last year, as multiple regional lenders collapsed. First Republic plunged nearly 100% and ultimately was taken over by JPMorgan Chase & Co., while SVB lost almost 70% following the failure of its Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary.\n\nOther major decliners in that span were Lumen Technologies Inc., Advance Auto Parts Inc. and Enphase Energy Inc., each of which shed about 60%. Most of these worst performers are no longer in the S&P 500.\n\n—With assistance from Alexandra Semenova.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "The appeal of electric vehicle (EV) stocks is clear to many investors. With the market size forecast to grow from $438.18 billion in 2023 to $1.09 trillion by 2030 at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 13.92%, it’s easy to see why so many are keen to embrace this form of sustainable investing.\n\nThe European Union, United States, United Kingdom, Japan and India, among other leading global nations, have all ramped up their focus on phasing out petrol vehicles in the 2030s. This signifies the potential of EV markets and their long-term use cases within the automotive sector.\n\nStocks within this industry aren’t entirely free from volatility. Growing competition in China is forcing prices lower in a way that’s impacting the profitability of EV firms. However, there’s no doubt about the leading role that electric vehicles will play in the future of the automotive industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt’s for this reason that investors are looking to capitalize on EV stocks that hold promise for the future. Stocks that show a strong emphasis on innovation and environmental credentials can offer plenty of upside. This is especially true as battery performance, range and functionality become increasingly sought after.\n\nThe future of the automotive industry is green. These three stocks are the best options for investors to buy and hold as the EV industry continues to grow.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) enjoyed an impressive Q2 2023 before weakening over the second half of the year. During this time, we saw plenty of growth on an operational level for the leading Chinese EV stock.\n\nAt the core of Li’s strong year was an astonishing 182.2% total deliveries growth to 376,030. Cumulative deliveries surpassed 600,000 vehicles. This makes the firm the most prolific among China’s emerging new energy automakers.\n\nWith the upcoming launch of Li MEGA, the firm’s flagship new MPV set to roll out in February 2024, the firm appears to be leading the charge to become China’s EV market leader. Also on the horizon for Li is the prospective expansion into Middle East markets, which the manufacturer is set to explore in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the support of a cash buffer of $12.13 billion reported in Q3 2023, we can see plenty of room for growth for this exciting stock in the future. In addition to this, LI remains an exciting stock for investors who are optimistic about the future of autonomous driving. Li Auto’s recently announced partnership with semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will see Nvidia’s DRIVE Thor centralized car computer power Li’s future EV fleets.\n\nRivian (RIVN) The Rivian Automotive, Inc, RIVN, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seen on a screen, viewing the stock price for the electric vehicle manufacturer.\n\nSource: The Bold Bureau / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) has endured a fairly torrid time on Wall Street since its debut in late 2021. Modest growth throughout 2023 points to a level of consolidation that could grow into outperformance in the future.\n\nCrucially, Rivian has been busy securing transformative deals in recent months. The news that the auto manufacturer will be supplying its vehicles for AT&T’s (NYSE:T) fleet represents a significant coup for the firm.\n\nLast year was key for Rivian to overcome production bottlenecks, with 57,232 vehicles produced and deliveries reaching 50,122 in 2023. In perhaps its biggest statement of intent, Rivian produced 17,541 vehicles in Q4 alone — offering a glimpse at the momentum it’s building.\n\nRivian’s management has boldly predicted that the firm will begin turning gross profit positive, making RIVN a solid pick for investors with a long-term outlook.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the EV industry’s more complex stocks. The tumultuous leadership of Elon Musk means that there’s rarely a dull moment for his firms. Still, the billionaire’s commitment to innovation is likely to secure the long-term viability of the likes of TSLA.\n\nTesla reached its target of selling 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. Furthermore, its deliveries in Q4 alone hit a total of 484,507.\n\nOn top of this, the highly anticipated launch of the Cybertruck has helped to keep the stock in the spotlight. Tesla’s commitment to autonomous driving is likely to ensure that it stays at the forefront of innovation.\n\nTesla’s profitability is a key factor for the stock’s sustainability. With three consecutive years of GAAP profits, there’s no longer a need to sell renewable energy credits to other automotive manufacturers to balance books.\n\nOne of the stock’s biggest supporters is Cathie Wood, CEO and CIO of Ark Invest. Before the stock’s 3-for-1 split in August 2023, Wood claimed that Tesla stock could reach the $4,600 mark. That would be a price target of $1,533.33 when adjusted for the split.\n\nToday, this would equate to an upside of over 575%, and there’s little that’s changed in Tesla’s fundamentals to suggest that this isn’t a viable goal.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "The past five years have been rewarding for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. The semiconductor specialist's stock is a solid multibagger, turning a January 2019 investment of $1,000 into $14,550 as of this writing. NVDA Chart\n\nThis terrific jump in Nvidia's stock price over the past decade can be attributed to the outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings. This growth is fueled by multiple catalysts, including the booming demand for gaming hardware, the growing demand for high-performance computing applications, the increasing deployment of semiconductors in cars, and now the need for graphics cards for training artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nThe good part is that Nvidia is setting itself up to deliver even stronger returns over the next five years through its aggressive product roadmap, which should allow it to capitalize on multiple multi-billion-dollar opportunities. It's worth noting that the company pointed out a couple of years ago that it sees a $1 trillion revenue opportunity across several end markets such as automotive, gaming, enterprise software, and chips and systems.\n\nGiven that it's on track to finish fiscal 2024 (which will end this month) with $59 billion in revenue, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth accelerating big time over the next decade as it dives deeper into its addressable market. Let's look at the reasons why that may happen and where the stock could be after five years.\n\nNvidia is growing at an eye-popping pace that shows no signs of slowing\n\nWhen Nvidia reported its fiscal 2019 results five years ago, the company generated annual revenue of $11.7 billion. So, Nvidia's revenue is on track to increase 5 times in a space of five years considering its fiscal 2024 forecast, translating into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%. A similar CAGR over the next five years would take Nvidia's annual revenue to a whopping $295 billion in fiscal 2029.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, certain Wall Street analysts believe that Nvidia could do even better. Take Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, for example. He predicts that Nvidia could generate annual revenue of $300 billion in 2027 from selling AI chips alone, thanks to having a solid 75% share of this fast-growing market. While that may seem outrageous at first, a closer look at the market for AI chips indicates that Nvidia could indeed hit that ambitious mark.\n\nIt's well known that Nvidia is the biggest player in one of the hottest tech niches right now -- AI chips -- which has allowed the company to record a terrific jump in revenue and earnings over the past year. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNote that this market for AI chips is at the beginning of a huge growth curve. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices estimates that the market for AI accelerators could jump to $400 billion in 2027, a big jump from last year's estimate of $45 billion. Citi analysts expect Nvidia to maintain a giant 90% share of this market over the next two to three years, despite the efforts its rivals are making to cut Nvidia's lead in this market.\n\nThat's because Nvidia has doubled down on the pace of innovation in AI chips, which should help it maintain a solid share of this market in the long run. As such, the possibility of Nvidia indeed generating $300 billion in annual revenue from AI chip sales after five years cannot be ruled out. It can hit that mark even if its share falls to 75% -- as Rakesh suggests -- considering that the overall AI chip market size is anticipated to hit $400 billion as per AMD's estimates.\n\nThe good news is that Nvidia is looking to flex its muscles beyond the AI accelerator market. The company recently revealed new consumer-focused graphics cards people can use to run AI applications right on their desktops and laptops for gaming, creating large language models (LLMs), customizing generative AI models, and even inferencing applications. For instance, Nvidia claims that its new RTX 4080 Super graphics card \"generates AI video 1.5x faster -- and images 1.7x faster -- than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU.\"\n\nGiven that the demand for devices that can run AI at the edge -- such as smartphones, personal computers, and cameras -- is expected to clock annual growth of 26% through 2032 and generate $143 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period, Nvidia is doing the right thing by tapping this market early.\n\nAlso, considering the other notable catalysts that Nvidia could benefit from, it won't be surprising to see the company's top line head closer to $300 billion after five years. If that's indeed the case, investors can expect the stock to deliver outstanding gains once again over the coming five years.\n\nInvestors can expect the stock to make them richer\n\nNvidia has a five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 20. As we are assuming that the company's revenue growth over the next five years can match the rate it has clocked in the past five, we can expect Nvidia to maintain its average sales multiple over the next five years as well. Based on a top line of $300 billion after five years, a sales multiple of 20 points toward a market cap of a whopping $6 trillion. That would be way higher than Nvidia's current market cap of around $1.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, Nvidia carries a discounted forward price-to-sales ratio of 14. Assuming a similar multiple after five years means that its market cap could increase to $4.2 trillion using the $300 billion revenue estimate. Again, that points toward a 3x jump in Nvidia's stock price over the next five years.\n\nAll this indicates that investors can expect Nvidia to jump substantially over the next five years and multiply their investments once again, making it a top growth stock to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 28% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 Brilliant AI Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper runs Appaloosa Management, a hedge fund that has regularly outperformed industry peers and the broader stock market since it was founded in 1993. Indeed, Appaloosa beat the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 15 percentage points over the last three years. That suggests Tepper and his fund's investment choices are worth studying.\n\nAs of the September quarter, Tepper had 28.2% of his Appaloosa portfolio invested in just three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks: 8.8% in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), 9.4% in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and 10% in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). That level of asset allocation is a clear sign of high conviction.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these three brilliant AI stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has a strong presence in two semiconductor markets: graphics chips for gaming and professional design and data center accelerators (graphics processing units or GPUs) for complex workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics, and it holds 80% to 95% market share in AI computing.\n\nNvidia has extended its ability to monetize both markets with subscription software and cloud services. Omniverse is a virtual design and simulation platform for developing 3D and robotics applications, as well as training autonomous vehicles. DGX Cloud is an AI application development platform comprising infrastructure, software, and pre-trained machine learning models. Many investors mistakenly see Nvidia as nothing more than a chipmaker, but that description fails to account for its growing software and services business. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino says Nvidia's \"software capabilities provide an incredible competitive moat.\"\n\nIn recent years, Nvidia has broadened its data center portfolio with networking platforms and central processing units (CPUs), both purpose-built for AI workloads. Networking revenue nearly tripled over the past year, and Nvidia is well positioned to take share in CPUs given that it holds 95% market share in data center GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, the graphics processor market is forecast to increase by 28% annually through 2030, while the AI market is forecast to increase by 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at annual sales growth exceeding 25% through the end of the decade. Even in that context, its current valuation of 30.4 times sales looks pricey, but I think patient investors willing to hold the stock for at least five years can buy a small position today.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three markets: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Specifically, it operates the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe as measured by sales volume. Amazon is also the largest retail advertiser in the U.S. and the third-largest ad tech company in the world. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nThat last point is particularly relevant. To quote Argus analyst Jim Kelleher, \"As the leading provider of infrastructure-as-a-service and other cloud services, AWS is uniquely positioned in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market.\" Indeed, the company is a recognized leader in cloud AI developer services, and its product pipeline is packed with AI innovations.\n\nAmazon Bedrock became generally available in September. That service provides pre-trained machine learning models and development tools that help businesses build generative AI applications. More recently, the company announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant that can create content and surface insights across data sources and enterprise systems like Microsoft SharePoint, Salesforce, and ServiceNow.\n\nGoing forward, retail e-commerce sales are forecast to increase by 8% annually through 2030, while the ad tech and cloud computing markets are forecast to expand by 14% annually during the same period. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit annual sales growth through the end of the decade, which makes its current valuation of 2.9 times sales look quite reasonable.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has a strong presence in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. The company accounts for more than 16% of software-as-a-service spending, nearly double the market share of its closest competitor, due to its leadership position in office productivity and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Similarly, Microsoft Azure accounts for 23% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending, second only to Amazon Web Services.\n\nMicrosoft is adding AI capabilities to its enterprise software to create new monetization opportunities. Microsoft 365 Copilot is a generative AI assistant that automates workflows across office productivity applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Similarly, Copilot for Dynamics 365 automates workflows across ERP applications for sales, marketing, customer service, and supply chain management.\n\nMicrosoft is also investing heavily in AI across its cloud computing business. Azure is the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI, and it's the only cloud platform that provides access to pre-trained models from OpenAI, including the GPT models that power ChatGPT. Businesses can use those models to build custom generative AI applications. JPMorgan Chase analysts believe \"Microsoft's investment into OpenAI, which started years ago, could potentially prove to be some of the best money ever spent.\"\n\nGoing forward, enterprise software-as-a-service and cloud computing sales are forecast to grow at 14% annually through 2030. That gives Microsoft a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. In that light, its current valuation of 13.3 times sales looks a bit pricey. I think patient investors can buy a small position today, but waiting for a cheaper price may be the most prudent course of action.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "If you’ve been investing for a decent length of time, you’ve probably heard the debate over how many stocks you should own. Some investors believe you should own 15-20 stocks or more to be fully diversified. Others believe you can get by with far fewer stocks. If you believe that less is more, here is a list of what could be the only stocks to own in 2024.\n\nThat’s a bold claim to make, I know. And this list is far from comprehensive. But I dare say it would give you exposure to the key sectors that are likely to lead the economy forward this year. Not surprisingly, some of the same themes from 2023 are still in place: artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and consumer staples.\n\nThis list of stocks to own also includes a favorite in the energy sector. It also features a couple of stocks that were laggards last year. These stocks will do fine with interest rates where they are, and even better if the Federal Reserve becomes more accommodative.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is a consumer staples stock that continues to generate growth far beyond its blue-chip status. In the last five years, the COST stock price has increased over 218%, and it’s up 42% in the last 12 months alone.\n\nThe buying thesis for Costco is simple enough. The company has a membership model. As long as consumers are willing to pay that fee, and with inflation being particularly sticky in an area like food, they have an incentive to shop at Costco.\n\nTo the first point, based on independent data Costco has about a 90% retention rate. As for being a safe haven from inflation, that evidence can be seen in the company’s revenue and earnings which continue to grow year-over-year.\n\nAnd the company also pays investors a safe and growing dividend which came with a special dividend of $15 at the end of 2023. That’s just another way the company continues to provide shareholder value.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 43x forward earnings, you’re definitely paying a premium for COST stock. But that shouldn’t scare you away from a company that continues to deliver for shareholders.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou might be curious as to why Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) isn’t on this list of stocks to own. And I believe that NVDA will have another strong year in 2024. But if you’re looking for a stock that may have a more 2023 Nvidia-like year, you may want to consider Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nA key reason is that after last year’s inventory glut, demand for semiconductors is expected to rise about 15% in 2024. One of the key applications will be AI. Currently, Nvidia simply can’t keep up with the demand. That opens the door for AMD and its new MI300 series accelerators. It’s priced lower than the NVDA H100 chip and is likely to fill a niche with companies that have indicated they want more choice.\n\nAMD is targeting $2 billion in revenue from the MI300 in 2024. Since Nvidia made an estimated $37.5 billion off its H100 chip last year, that estimate may be too conservative. Regardless, the company is forecasting 50% earnings growth that does not appear to be priced into AMD stock at this time.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity will be another important theme for investors in 2024. Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is not the leader in this space. That goes to Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). But like Advanced Micro Devices with Nvidia, Fortinet has an opportunity to capture market share that offers the chance for outsized gains.\n\nThe reason is that Fortinet has a deep product portfolio geared towards companies who may not have the budget for the best-in-class products. But even “low-value” targets need to be concerned about cybersecurity.\n\nFurthermore, Fortinet’s pioneering work around AI and machine learning (ML) powered security has made the company a leader in network firewalls specifically as it relates to its ability to execute.\n\nFortinet is forecasting 5.4% earnings growth in the next year and analysts are lowering their price targets in advance of the company’s earnings. This suggests that FTNT stock may continue to face resistance near its 200-day simple moving average. However, if earnings surprise to the upside, there is significant room for the stock to recapture its all-time high made in July 2023.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the one Magnificent 7 stock that I’m including on this list of top stocks to own in 2024. One reason is the company’s commitment to digital innovation. And you can’t talk about that without noting the company’s leadership in generative AI which started with its investment in OpenAI and ChatGPT.\n\nIf you work with the Microsoft 365 suite of products, you’re already familiar with one of the first fruits of that collaboration. That is, the company’s Copilot assistant software. Copilot will help fuel growth in Microsoft’s cloud computing division. It will also be an arrow in the company’s quiver if the PC market comes back as many analysts believe it will.\n\nBeyond AI, Microsoft is also a leader in gaming. In 2023, the company generated over $15 billion in revenue from gaming. With its acquisition of Activision Blizzard that number is expected to reach $20 billion in a market that’s expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.3% through 2029.\n\nAnd while investors should still expect significant capital gains from MSFT stock. The company’s dividend is becoming impossible to ignore. The yield of 0.73% isn’t noteworthy, but the annual payout of $3.00 per share which has been growing for the last 20 consecutive years adds a “forever stock” quality to this tech giant’s stock.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt times the axiom to never bet against the American consumer seems trite. However, in 2023, it proved to be truly prescient. The consumer continued to spend. This was despite rising interest rates for much of the year, inflation that remained well above the Federal Reserve’s preferred rate, and predictions for a recession.\n\nAnd according to the New York Fed, the consumer was piling up credit card debt at record pace. Specifically, total credit card debt climbed to $1.08 trillion in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThat may seem like a cynical reason to invest in Visa (NYSE:V). But frequently investing is about understanding the facts on the ground. In this case, the consumer continues to spend on major purchases including travel. And there isn’t sufficient data that shows the trend changing.\n\nWith that in mind, investors can expect more quarters of sequentially rising revenue. That also means higher year-over-year earnings. And, you should also consider the company’s $25 stock repurchase plan approved by the company’s board of directors in October 2023.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nThe last two picks on this list of stocks to own could be called the comeback kids. That is, companies that underperform the market one year frequently outperform in the following year. Let’s start with the case for PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).\n\nInvestors started the year concerned about the consumer’s appetite for discretionary purchases like soft drinks and snack foods in the face of rising food prices. The year ended with concerns that the weight loss craze would eat into the company’s revenue and profits.\n\nThat’s not showing up in the company’s revenue and earnings. Growth wasn’t spectacular, but it should justify a higher stock price for PEP stock. In summer 2023, the stock hit its all-time high of over $196. It’s pulled back sharply since then and is struggling to stay above its 50-day simple moving average.\n\nNevertheless, this looks to be a chance for investors to take a position in PEP stock while there’s some upside to be had. Pepsi is forecasting a 7.4% rise in earnings in the next 12 months. And even if the stock price growth is delayed by a quarter or two, you’ll still collect a dividend that yields over 3% and pays out $5.06 per share annually.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of Warren Buffet’s favorite stocks, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) makes this list as a recovery play in the energy sector. Oil and gas stocks were among the stock market’s biggest underperformers in 2023. The expected rise in crude oil prices stalled out around $80 a barrel and at one point fell below $70.\n\nBut the long-term outlook for oil demand remains unchanged. And it’s still more likely than not that investors can expect $100 oil or higher at some point in 2024. That’s one reason that Buffett is buying OXY stock hand over fits. Another reason is that the company has aggressively paid down debt and improved its capital structure. Free cash flow is increasing, as is the company’s dividend, while the company’s share count is shrinking.\n\nBuffett’s hedge fund, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) owns 34% of the company. It can – and likely will – continue to buy more shares of the company if prices remain below $60, a level becoming known as the Buffett buy zone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "$10,000 Invested in These Growth Stocks Could Make You a Fortune Over the Next 10 Years",
        "content": "Are you looking for a really big investment win? Such trades require taking on above-average risk, of course, with no assurance of a major return being achieved. They also often need years to fully pan out. But they can certainly be worth it.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three prospects that could turn a $10,000 investment into a relative fortune. Just keep close tabs on them if you decide to take a swing. After all, these stocks offer tremendous upside potential specifically because their underlying companies' futures remain a bit murky.\n\nRocket Lab USA\n\nMankind has been deploying communication satellites since the late 1950s, and using them in earnest since the 1960s. Since the beginning of this century they've been used to offer broadband-based internet access to and from outer space.\n\nAnd yet, we've only scratched the surface of the potential demand for satellite-based communications. The ongoing digitization of, well, everything is forcing enterprises and institutions to find more efficient ways to handle more and more information.\n\nEnter Rocket Lab USA(NASDAQ: RKLB).\n\nJust as the name suggests, Rocket Lab puts satellites into space. To date, more than 1,700 satellites are in orbit thanks to the company's technology. It's also already got 22 launches lined up for the year now underway, many of which will be carrying multiple satellites. More launches could be scheduled for this year in the meantime too. That may raise the 19% revenue growth rate analysts are currently anticipating for 2024.\n\nThis new era of space-based telecom is still in its infancy, however. Now that all these related technologies -- and the need for them -- have caught up with one another, industry research and consulting firm Quilty Space believes roughly 20,000 additional satellites will be put into orbit before the end of the decade.\n\nAnd Rocket Lab USA's off to a great start winning this not-so-distant-future business. Although this year's growth outlook isn't exactly out of this world, the analyst community expects its top line to swell an impressive 72% next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat still won't be enough to push the company out of the red and into the black. It will push it in that direction, though, further fleshing out Rocket Lab's long-term potential as a solutions provider in the rapidly evolving orbital launch business.\n\nEnphase Energy\n\nIt's been a tough year for solar power equipment maker Enphase Energy(NASDAQ: ENPH), and by extension, for Enphase Energy shareholders. Shares are down more than 60% since late 2022, with economic malaise undermining demand for new solar panel installations.\n\nDon't mistake a short-term headwind as a fading long-term opportunity, however. Enphase should still have its day in the sun.\n\nIf you're not familiar, Enphase Energy makes solar power hardware. It doesn't make solar panels, though; panels are practically a commodity anymore. Rather, Enphase manufactures inverters that convert the sun's rays into usable electricity. Its IQ8 microinverters work as well in commercial settings as they do in residential, although its corresponding tech makes Enphase's equipment very well-suited for home use.\n\nAs was noted, last year was a toughie. Analysts believe the company will report full-year sales growth of nil when it posts its fourth-quarter results early next month. Earnings likely fell just a bit. The same analyst community expects the company's top and bottom lines to fall this year, with demand for solar power technology remaining under duress thanks to economic headwinds.\n\nTake a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. Solar power is the heart of the energy industry's future. Even with its current weakness, the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects solar power to account for nearly all of the nation's power-production capacity this year and next, mirroring clean-energy initiatives in other parts of the world. Indeed, that projected 79 gigawatts' worth of additional power-generating installations should drive solar's share of domestic energy production from last year's 4% to 7% by the end of 2025, again mirroring worldwide demand.\n\nThings are even more compelling for the longer haul. Mordor Intelligence says the global energy market will expand at an annualized pace of nearly 30% between now and 2029. Enphase stock's recent pullback is a means of stepping into that megatrend at a discount.\n\nNvidia\n\nLast but not least, add Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) to your list of stocks a $10,000 investment in today could grow into a fortune 10 years from now.\n\nIt's the biggest and best-grounded of the three companies in question. That's why its potential gains are also the smallest -- it's the lowest-risk prospect of the three. That doesn't mean it can't dish out serious gains in the foreseeable future, though.\n\nThe key to this growth is the advent of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile the world's done amazing things with the technology so far, we've only just begun to figure out how to commercialize AI. Precedence Research believes the worldwide AI market is going to swell from 2023's total of around $500 billion to more than $2.5 trillion in 2032. Nvidia's place in this market? It makes the hardware that makes AI possible. Estimates put its market share at around 90%.\n\nThe key to winning and keeping this commanding market share is Nvidia's purpose-built, turnkey AI platforms that leverage the company's well-proven video processing architecture. As it turns out, the same tech that makes for great graphics cards is ideally suited for AI applications as well.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia's latest GeForce RTX Super GPUs (graphics processing units) allow laptops to be generative AI workstations, while its HGX H200 platform unveiled in November of last year \"delivers 141GB of memory at 4.8 terabytes per second, nearly double the capacity and 2.4x more bandwidth compared with its predecessor, the NVIDIA A100.\" It matters simply because more computing speed makes for more powerful AI applications.\n\nThe AI business's highest-growth days are likely in the past. The runway is still very long, however, with tons of opportunity ahead. And, with roughly three-fourths of the company's revenue now coming from AI solutions, the industry's impending growth bodes well for Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rocket Lab USA right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rocket Lab USA, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Rocket Lab USA wasn't one of them.

        "content": "One of the top performers at the start of 2024 has been Nvidia NVDA with the chipmaker largely outperforming the broader market and now soaring over +200% in the last year.\n\nNvidia’s blazing trail has led to higher highs as investors flock to consume positions in the artificial intelligence leader. Let’s see if it’s still time to buy Nvidia’s stock which is already up +20% year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent Momentum\n\nRemarkably, Nvidia’s stock blew past the $500 a share mark last week continuing a very bullish trend after eclipsing its 50-day moving average and has blown away its 200-day moving average.\n\nNvidia’s stock is currently on the cusp of trading at $600 a share closing today’s trading session up +4% and hitting new 52-week highs of $595. The pile-in comes as Nvidia’s superior AI chip the HGX H200 is slated to come out during the second quarter of this year and is expected to keep the company ahead of competitors like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhen Does Nvidia Report Earnings?\n\nNvidia will be reporting its Q4 resutls on February 28 and is expected to post another quarter of exponential growth.\n\nFourth quarter earnings are expected to skyrocket 410% to $4.49 a share versus $0.88 per share a year ago. Quarterly sales are projected to soar 232% to $20.1 billion. This would also mark Nvidia’s fifth consecutive quarter of stellar sequential growth on both its top and bottom lines with Q4 EPS and sales anticipated to rise 11% from the third quarter respectively.\n\nNvidia has now surpassed earnings expectations for four straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 18.99%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the Average Zacks Price Target of $649.11 a share still suggests 13% upside. Stellar growth and more importantly its position as a leader in powering artificial intelligence could propel Nvidia’s stock even higher leading up to its Q4 report in February.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So if we continue to move in this direction, that's going to be a very positive sentiment sign,\" said Lisa Erickson, head of public markets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.\n\nNvidia climbed 4.2% and Advanced Micro Devices rallied over 7% after server maker Super Micro Computer lifted its second-quarter profit forecast, sending its shares soaring 36%.\n\nInvestors exchanged $31 billion worth of Nvidia's stock and $23 billion worth of AMD shares, higher turnover than any other company on Wall Street, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index soared 4% to a record high, while the S&P 500 information technology sector index jumped more than 2% to a record highs.\n\nMicrosoft and Apple, the world's two most valuable companies, both rose more than 1%.\n\nChipmaker stocks have gained since Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, on Wednesday said it saw booming demand for high-end chips used in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nasdaq jumped 1.70% to 15,310.97 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.05% to 37,863.80 points.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was heavy, with 12.3 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.5 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.\n\nAfter surging through December, Wall Street treaded water in recent weeks as investors reined in expectations the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates as soon as March.\n\nInterest rate traders now see a 52% chance of a March rate cut, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nStock investors were also cheered on Friday by the University of Michigan's preliminary survey showing consumer sentiment improved in January to its highest level since the summer of 2021.\n\nThe S&P 500 could lose steam if companies reporting quarterly results over the next few weeks fail to justify relatively high valuations. Netflix reports on Tuesday, followed by Tesla on Wednesday.\n\n\"This new record level of the S&P 500 is sustainable as long as earnings meet expectations,\" said Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers.\n\n\"If, on the other hand, we find out that the market has either gotten ahead of itself ... or we get guidance from some of these companies that doesn't match the bullish sentiment that's being priced into them, that can be a real risk.”\n\nTravelers Cos jumped 6.7% after the insurer's fourth-quarter profit more than doubled, while State Street advanced 2.1% after the lender reported record net inflows in its Global Advisors unit in the fourth quarter.\n\nSpirit Airlines rebounded 17% from losses earlier this week as it assessed options to refinance its 2025 debt maturities amid concerns over the airline's ability to remain afloat.\n\niRobot slumped almost 27% after a report said the European Union's competition watchdog plans to block Amazon.com's $1.4-billion acquisition of the robot vacuum maker.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 2.9-to-one ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 60 new highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 97 new highs and 191 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Siddarth S; Editing by Pooja Desai and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have become increasingly important in today’s digital age. Semiconductors power smartphones, tablets and PCs; these tiny devices are in cars, aircraft and drones. While providing functionality to various electronic devices in the modern era, semiconductors are also critical to supercharging technological revolutions, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and quantum computing breakthroughs.\n\nAs the chip glut ends and the macroeconomic environment improves, now may be the time to buy capable semiconductor stocks. Below are three such stocks that are poised for a super cycle surge.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) made a name when the fabless chipmaker dethroned Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market. AMD is poised to challenge Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), its prime competitor in the GPU chip market. In particular, AMD is slated to enter the AI chip race in 2024 officially. At the beginning of the second half of 2023, the chipmaker finally announced the MI300x GPU chipset, which will eventually compete directly with Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips to train large language models (LLMs). Later that year, the chipmaker also announced it expected to sell $2 billion in AI chips in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s recall the AI revolution and its dependency on high-powered GPUs, which incited a strong rally in Nvidia’s share price throughout 2023. AMD’s entrance into the AI chip market could help position the stock for a super cycle rally later in 2024.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON) a close up image of a semiconductor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON), or “Onsemi,” is a leading provider of power management, analog, sensors and connectivity semiconductor devices. Due to its wide range of products, the chipmaker serves diverse end markets, including industrial and consumer electronics. However, as electric vehicle (EVs) smart connectivity devices have become more mainstream, Onsemi has recently shifted its focus to developing power-efficient semiconductor solutions for these markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe semiconductor firm’s exposure to consumer electronics and IoT end-markets has caused a slowdown in top-line growth as there has been a general pullback in consumer spending on electronics since the height of the pandemic. Onsemi’s sluggish quarterly revenue growth in 2023 reflects this recent spending dynamic. However, the chip manufacturers, from Samsung to TSMC (NYSE:TSM), have implied the “chip glut” may be over soon enough. Moreover, Onsemi’s electric vehicle segment could be a bright spot in the coming years as consumers increasingly consider electric vehicles over combustion engine vehicles.\n\nON shares are trading at only 15.5 times forward earnings, below many semiconductor giants.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a leading supplier of wet processing equipment and technologies for the semiconductor industry. Firms in charge of manufacturing semiconductor devices often turn to ACM’s wet-cleaning and front-end processing tools to produce higher yields in their manufacturing processes. The company focuses on China, where it conducts most of its product development, manufacturing and support services. While some may see this as a weakness, its focus on China-based customers could allow it to benefit from the burgeoning semiconductor sector there that has become increasingly competitive.\n\nACM Research is delivering impressive quarterly financial results in 2023. In their second quarter earnings print, the firm announced operations had largely gone back to pre-Covid levels, which would help the company to focus on its growth and expansion efforts. Second quarter revenue came in at $144.6 million, representing a year-over-year (Y/Y) increase of 38.4%. ACM research’s third quarter results were impressive, beating Wall Street’s revenue and earnings estimates. Revenue increased by 53% Y/Y, while non-GAAP EPS increased by 36% Y/Y.\n\nACM’s share price skyrocketed more than 153% in 2023, and its stock price is off to a good start in 2024. Despite the rally, ACMR still looks cheap. The company’s enterprise value to EBITDA ratio trades around 10.5x forward EBITDA. With an inexpensive valuation, a growing customer base and operations getting back on track, ACM Research could make a profitable long-term bet among semiconductor stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stocks hit an all-time high on Friday, as the AI craze continues to roll on in early 2024. Nvidia’s share price jumped more than 2% to $584.87 as of midday. Shares of the AI juggernaut are up some 18% in the first few weeks of the new year and 179% over the last 12 months. And its market cap is quickly approaching $1.5 trillion.\n\nBut Nvidia isn’t the only company benefiting from the AI hype. Rival AMD (AMD) hit an all-time intraday high on Thursday, topping out at $168.60 per share. The chipmaker is up 94% through the last 12 months. Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped 57% over the same period.\n\nNvidia got a huge vote of confidence on Thursday when Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is spending billions of dollars to acquire thousands of Nvidia chips for its AI projects. In an Instagram Reels post, Zuckerberg said Meta will build out AI infrastructure complete with 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 with the goal of developing general artificial intelligence.

Courtesy of Nvidia Corp/Handout via REUTERS (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nZuckerberg also said he wants to make Meta’s general AI open source, allowing others to use and work with it.\n\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip development, with an estimated market share of between 70% and 90% of the global market. But it’s not just Nvidia’s hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The company’s Cuda software, which developers use to create AI platforms, also serves as a moat that keeps Nvidia above the fray.\n\nThat said, Nvidia’s rivals are gathering with the intent of snatching market share. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its own Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nIt’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Meta, are increasingly turning to chips they develop on their own to power their AI accelerators in the form of what are known as ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits.\n\nStory continues Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThink of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it.\n\nASICs on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. They’re built specifically for a company’s own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\n\nThat’s a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as ASICs start to take hold, they may have less of a need for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nStill, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. In other words, there’s still plenty of room to grow. Even if Nvidia’s market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.\n\nFor now, though, Nvidia remains the AI king.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Growth stocks have been a reliable choice for many years. Besides a brief crash at the start of the pandemic and a disappointing 2022, growth stocks have generally rewarded long-term investors.\n\nThese stocks tend to outpace less risky assets due to higher revenue and earnings growth. While some growth stocks have lofty valuations and questionable timelines for profitability, others are already profitable with reasonable valuations.\n\nWhile growth stocks have more dramatic price swings, investors with lengthy time horizons exceeding a decade can wait out the dips. Buying promising growth stocks with good financials and great runways can lead to outsized returns in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors have poured their money into Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for years, but the company’s dominant position in artificial intelligence (AI) attracted more attention in 2023. The stock has more than doubled over the past year and is up more than 1,300% over the past five years.\n\nThose types of gains will get any investor’s attention, but the company’s valuation and financials suggest the rally isn’t over. Nvidia trades at a reasonable 26-forward P/E ratio. That valuation is justified due to the company’s robust revenue and earnings growth.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Nvidia reported 206% year-over-year revenue growth and 588% year-over-year net income growth. Revenue and earnings also grew 34% and 49% quarter-over-quarter, respectively. Most companies would love to have those growth rates as year-over-year results.\n\nFounder and CEO Jensen Huang cited accelerated computing and generative artificial intelligence as two key components of the company’s ascent. While staying focused on AI is easy, Nvidia has other vibrant segments. Gaming and Professional Visualization experienced 81% and 108% year-over-year growth, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s GPU chips dominate the industry, and the growth story may remain intact for several years.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile many growth stocks have the distinction of being tech companies with scalable platforms and software, Elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) breaks from those expectations.\n\nThe company produces beauty and skincare products that use ethical ingredients instead of ones that stem from animal abuse. The brand’s social messaging and quality products are a hit among Gen Z customers and are expanding to Gen X customers.\n\nThe stock trades at a 72 P/E ratio, higher than a value investor would like. However, the company’s growth justifies the price tag. Elf Beauty has achieved 16 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, but it gets even better.\n\nRevenue growth has been accelerating in recent quarters instead of contracting. In other words, Elf Beauty has a large addressable market and is reaching new customers faster than before.\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Elf Beauty delivered 76% year-over-year net sales growth and almost tripled its net income year-over-year. Elf Beauty has given investors many reasons to feel confident about future growth prospects.\n\nIt’s been a great ride for investors as shares are up by almost 1,800% over the past five years. The stock has more than tripled over the past year.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a growth stock that fulfills the common trope of impressive growth at a high valuation. Shares trade at a 57 forward P/E ratio thanks to surging net income growth.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm started the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with GAAP net income rising from $20.0 million to $194.2 million. That translates into an 871% year-over-year increase. Revenue grew by a respectable 20% year-over-year, while the company’s remaining performance obligations grew by 26% year-over-year. Growth in remaining performance obligations suggests revenue growth will carry over into the next quarter.\n\nNikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks, cited “an unprecedented level of attacks” for fueling strong demand for cybersecurity software and services.\n\nCybersecurity is a lucrative industry. Unfortunately, cybercrime is also a lucrative industry for hackers who obtain vital information and resources. While cyberattacks on large corporations often become headlines, hackers target smaller companies and individuals with fewer protections.\n\nCybersecurity is a necessary defense against unethical hackers. Investors looking for promising sectors should consider how this feedback loop works for cybersecurity firms.\n\nAs long as there is a villain, a hero will always be needed. Cybersecurity companies like Palo Alto Networks are the heroes in this case, and that dynamic has resulted in significant returns for shareholders. The stock has more than doubled over the past year and is up 360% over the past five years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA and ELF.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Sell in January Before They Crash and Burn",
        "content": "The metaverse has been a hot topic for several years now. Ever since Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerburg renamed his company to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), investors have taken this concept seriously. We’ve seen Super Bowl ads and all sorts of other mainstream attention for the metaverse concept. Unfortunately for some, this has led to this list of metaverse stocks to sell.\n\nAnd yet, Meta’s own Horizon Worlds appears to be a money-burning flop, at least to date. Whether it be issues with the technical hardware, a lack of glamorous metaverse applications, or simply consumer disinterest in the concept, virtual worlds haven’t taken off as expected.\n\nThat’s particularly bad news for these three metaverse stocks in particular. While it is too early to write off the concept entirely, investors should be extremely wary about these three metaverse stocks today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has long been a story stock. While the company’s profits and fundamentals have been mediocre recently, traders have gravitated to AMD stock for a variety of narratives.\n\nFor a while, AMD purported to have an upside based on crypto mining. Lately, many folks are excited about AMD due to AI possibilities, even though AMD’s program there appears to be far behind that of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAMD also has gotten caught up in the hype cycle around the metaverse. In theory, AMD could make a lot of money selling graphics chips if the metaverse takes off and the big tech companies need far more computing power to operate all these virtual world applications.\n\nIn practice, however, there’s little evidence of broad metaverse adoption and scant reason to think it will improve AMD’s operating results shortly.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSocial media company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is a fascinating enterprise. Its focus on younger users and more image-driven messaging seemed like it could make for a significant player in its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, between operational issues and heavy competition, Snap has failed to deliver on that promise. The company is only marginally profitable, with a forward P/E ratio of more than 200. Meanwhile, revenue growth has stalled almost entirely, with the company on pace for less than 1% revenue growth for the full year 2023.\n\nSnapchat is a leading innovator in virtual and augmented reality applications. If these take off, perhaps that will finally be the thing that helps Snap reach more mainstream adoption. However, CEO Evan Spiegel has been skeptical of Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse, and it seems virtual worlds won’t provide salvation for SNAP’s stock price anytime soon.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is a leading gaming ecosystem. With its low-definition graphics and focus on user-generated content, Roblox has achieved a high adoption rate among younger users.\n\nRoblox has a large virtual world, and it is one of the few that already has meaningful revenue generation with some mainstream brands and companies advertising there. This makes it seem like a logical thought that Roblox will become a triumphant player in the metaverse.\n\nHowever, Roblox’s user base remains overwhelmingly young. This has led to issues, such as inappropriate content allegedly being shown to minors. In addition, it can be hard to build a mainstream and highly profitable platform primarily aimed at people under 18.\n\nRoblox has grown revenues quickly. But there is little sign of operating scale. The company lost more than $1 billion last year. Analysts expect Roblox to remain loss-making through at least 2028. For now, Roblox’s virtual worlds aren’t turning into real-world profits or cash flow. This makes it one of those metaverse stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AMD’s Record High Shows AI-Fueled Chip Rally Has Another Gear",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is on track for its best week since November, outpacing even AI-darling Nvidia Corp., as optimism builds anew around the semiconductor industry’s growth prospects.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYouTube and Spotify Won’t Launch Apple Vision Pro Apps, Joining Netflix Ford Cuts Workforce Making Electric F-150s on Weak Demand Putin Orders Hunt for Property of Russian Empire, Soviet Union Blinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down China’s Biggest Broker Curbs Short Sales After Stock Rout\n\nAMD shares closed at a record high on Thursday and rose again in early trading Friday. They’re up roughly 65% since October, handily beating both Nvidia and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in that period. AMD has surged roughly 12% this week, outpacing a nearly 6% leap for Nvidia, which is also climbing Friday and set an all-time high Thursday.\n\nInvestors see huge growth potential for chips and expect that Nvidia “won’t be the sole winner,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “Investors are looking for a catch-up trade” after Nvidia’s stellar performance in the past year, he said.\n\nSemiconductor shares got a boost overall on Thursday from better-than-expected fourth quarter results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The main chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia said it expects revenue growth of at least 20% for the year, after a slump in 2023.\n\nRead more: TSMC’s Outlook Backs Hopes for Global Tech Recovery in 2024\n\nAMD shares got a lift early this week when analysts at firms including Barclays Plc, Susquehanna Financial and TD Cowen boosted their price targets.\n\nOf those three, Barclays now has the highest target at $200 per share, raising it from $120 on the potential for artificial intelligence as a driver. The stock traded as high as $167 on Friday. More than 70% of analysts covering AMD have a buy-equivalent rating, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nRead more: AMD CEO Debuts Nvidia Chip Rival, Gives Eye-Popping Forecast\n\nStory continues\n\nRisks Ahead\n\nIn a sign of how the Street has struggled to keep up with the stock’s ascent, the average 12-month price target of around $150 implies a drop of about 9%.\n\nSome of that gap is due to AMD’s recent rally - the stock price only overtook the average analyst price target in December after months below the level.\n\nAnalysts can also be slow to update target prices and ratings, especially in the weeks before an earnings release. Both AMD and Nvidia have upcoming earnings reports that will give investors a sense of their growth outlook for the year ahead. AMD releases results on Jan. 30, and Nvidia in late February.\n\nThe reason Nvidia has surged so much and continues to be a favorite is its booming revenue growth, which gives it a cheaper valuation than many peers. Nvidia trades at about 28 times forward earnings, a premium to the semiconductor share benchmark at about 23. AMD trades at a multiple of more than 40.\n\n“Those stocks are more than fully valued at this point, especially AMD,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, adding that AMD has more to prove because earnings haven’t come through yet. “It’s not a good setup for the bulls right now.”\n\nIf the rally in chipmakers fades, it could present an opportunity to those who are bullish on AI’s long-term prospects, Young said.\n\n“These are definitely stocks you want to buy on any weakness, but just tactically you probably don’t want to chase them here today,” he said.\n\nStill, the sector’s strength to start the year shows that the enthusiasm around AI that propelled chipmaker shares and the tech sector in 2023 hasn’t faded, even as a rally in the S&P 500 Index appears to have stalled.\n\n“If you believe in AI then you believe in the broadening of the opportunity — it’s not just one or two companies that are going to take that share,” said Will Rhind, chief executive officer of GraniteShares. “This is just reinforcing the narrative that AI has a lot more room to run.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAnother dismal week for Chinese equities saw grim milestones pile up. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech Index, which hosts the likes of Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Xiaomi Corp., is already down 17% in 2024 after three straight years of losses. The index has seen about $1.8 trillion wiped out since a February 2021 peak.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nApple Inc.’s long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will finally be available for preorders on Friday, giving the company its first real taste of consumer demand for the $3,499 device.\n\nApple vowed to open up its coveted tap-to-pay technology on iPhones to rivals in a bid to sidestep potentially massive European Union antitrust fines. Amazon.com Inc.’s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot Corp. is expected to be blocked by the European Union’s antitrust regulator over concerns that the deal will harm other robot vacuum makers. When fast fashion giant Shein firmed up plans for a US initial public offering late last year, the online retailer hoped that it wouldn’t be subjected to regulatory review in China. Paytm trimmed losses in the latest quarter after the Indian fintech company cut costs and scaled up services to small merchants.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks — Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META — had a stellar 2023.

        "title": "5 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Sparkling Returns in 2024",
        "content": "The broader semiconductor industry is continuing its dream run in early 2024 after an astonishing 2023. On Jan 18, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) closed at 4,206.52, soaring 50% over the past year and up 2.6% year to date. The ongoing momentum is likely to continue on the back of several positive catalysts.\n\nStrong Global Demand\n\nThe explosion of artificial intelligence (AI) in both production processes and final products has created tremendous opportunities for chipset manufacturers. The data-centric computing architecture, especially, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the metaverse, has expanded the horizon for semiconductors.\n\nThe pandemic-led social transformation has established digitization as the new normal. The outbreak of coronavirus quickly changed the lifestyle and outlook of people. The latest advent seen in the digitization space is that of the metaverse.\n\nIn a nutshell, metaverse means a virtual world that is interactive and collaborative. The digital space is powered using virtual and augmented reality. Therefore, high-tech semiconductors are an essential part of metaverse. The demand for chipsets will remain strong due to the complexity of new leading-edge technologies.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the United States and in international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies for producing high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings results of the last reported quarter of NVIDIA — the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets — raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. — the world's largest contract chipmaker — recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, s global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024. Technology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI server and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five giant semiconductor companies with strong growth potential in 2024.These stocks have seen positive earnings revisions in the last 60 days. Each of Our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 53.7% and 63.1%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM manufactures, packages, tests, and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices in Taiwan, China, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, the United States and internationally. .\n\nTSM provides complementary metal oxide silicon wafer fabrication processes to manufacture logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, and embedded memory semiconductors. TSM also offers customer support and engineering services, as well as manufactures masks. Its products are used in high-performance computing, smartphone, IoT, automotive, and digital consumer electronics.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Taiwan Semiconductor has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.1% and 19.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last seven days.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has been benefiting from an improving supply-demand environment and signals that the industrywide sluggish period is nearing its end. The expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips used in the data center end market.\n\nA rising mix of high-value solutions and improving customer engagement and cost structure are growth drivers for MU. Moreover, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 43.4% and 90.1%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 60.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD is benefiting from portfolio strength and an expanding partner base. Strong demand for EPYC processors has been a growth driver for AMD. The launch of the Ryzen 8040 series processor with Ryzen AI and Instinct MI300 Series data center AI accelerators bodes well for top-line growth.\n\nAMD continues to benefit from acquisitions, including Xilinx and Pensando, which has diversified its business. For fourth-quarter 2023, AMD expects year-over-year growth in the Data Center and Client segments by a double-digit percentage. Sequentially, the Data Center segment’s revenues are expected to grow on a double-digit percentage, while Client are also expected to increase.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Advanced Micro Devices has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.8% and 37.4%, respectively, for the current year.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market started 2024 on a positive note after closing out last year on a high. On Jan 10, the most anticipated moment arrived, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) finally giving the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe move, believed to be one of the most significant events to have happened in the cryptocurrency market history, added fuel to the Bitcoin (BTC) rally. This approval will now allow retail investors to trade the world's most prominent cryptocurrency without actually owning it.\n\nBitcoin prices soared past $47,500 following the announcement. However, Bitcoin price has since fallen sharply. On Jan 18, Bitcoin traded lower by nearly 3.5% at $41,364.33. Earlier, it dropped to $40,601.37, hitting its lowest level since Dec 18.\n\nAlthough last week’s positive news raised hopes that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would continue their dream run, the rally has somewhat stalled. Bitcoin has entered correction territory post the ETF launch.\n\nExperts believe that Bitcoin continues to hold a lot of potential and the ETF launch will only boost the market in the long term. Despite the inherent volatility and associated risks of cryptocurrencies, the move to bring them into the mainstream has been eagerly anticipated.\n\nThis shift is expected to facilitate a closer monitoring of the digital coin market, a development that the sector has historically resisted.\n\nHowever, since the approval, Bitcoin has lost 12% of its value as several investors have been flocking to institutional investment products to avoid risk. Also, the flow of Bitcoin to derivative exchanges has ceased its growth, a trend that has previously indicated bear markets or impending price corrections.\n\nHowever, the correction phase is temporary and last week’s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs is only going to boost the crypto market.\n\nhas improved 3.1% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nBlackRock, Inc. BLK is one of the world’s largest investment managers and is publicly owned. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race back in June 2023.\n\nBlackRock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 3.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 60 days. BlackRock presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

COIN offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment.\n\nCoinbase Global’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 92.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.2% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings, Inc. MARA is a digital asset technology company. MARA mines cryptocurrencies, with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 95.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 47.1% over the last 90 days. Marathon Digital Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268.6%.

        "content": "Who says that investing needs to be exciting? Highs and lows, thrills and dread, never knowing what comes next. That’s the life of an investor with a high-risk tolerance. But it doesn’t have to be that way if you’re just looking to make money, and do it with stable stocks for growth and long-term stability.\n\nSome people may call that boring. But Warren Buffett amassed a fortune by investing in so-called boring stocks with a consistent growth window and long-term stability. And I don’t think anyone accuses Buffett of being a bad investor.\n\nThe stocks on this list are rated as a conservative bet in the Portfolio Grader. That’s a free tool that evaluates stocks based on earnings performance, revenue and income growth, analyst sentiment, momentum, and other factors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, each of these stocks has an “A” rating for growth in the Portfolio Grader and above-average overall marks in the tool.\n\nIf you’re looking to reduce volatility and find some stocks you can hold for the long term, this list is for you. These stocks for growth and long-term stability will keep you in the game and let you sleep well at night.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nI can hear the howls of protest now. How can Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year with a 239% gain be considered a conservative pick?\n\nAfter all, this company powered the generative artificial intelligence revolution last year, cornering over 85% of the market with its powerful chips that make generative AI possible. Nvidia’s revenue grew by leaps and bounds last year, and the company’s market capitalization soared to $1.2 trillion.\n\nI get it. But Nvidia is a conservative pick because these gains aren’t short-lived. The demand for generative AI will only increase, and Nvidia will maintain the lion’s share of that market, even as other competitors join the field.\n\nAnalysts believe Nvidia is undervalued due to its low forward P/E ratio of 25, the lowest since 2018. Despite Nvidia’s share price nearing $500, its expected $20 billion quarterly revenue makes it a bargain.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDorian LPG (LPG) Ship tanker gas LPG, Aerial view Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) tanker, Tanker ship logistic and transportation business oil and gas industry, Loading arm oil and gas offshore platforms.\n\nSource: Avigator Fortuner / Shutterstock.com\n\nDorian LPG (NYSE:LPG) is a liquified petroleum gas shipping company. It operates 25 modern very large gas carriers called VLGCs with a 2.1 million cubic meters capacity.\n\nMaybe that sounds boring. But transporting fuel products is a lucrative business. People use liquified petroleum gases in everything from gas barbecue grills to ovens, gas fireplaces, and portable heaters.\n\nThe stock had a great run, gaining 135% over the last year. It also pays a quarterly dividend of $1 per share, which at today’s prices is a dividend yield of 9.5%.\n\nEarnings for the second fiscal quarter of 2024 (ending Sept. 30, 2023) included revenue of $144.7 million, up from $76 million a year ago. Income of $76.5 million and $1.90 per share was a big improvement from a year ago when LPG brought in $20.3 million and 51 cents per share.\n\nLPG stock gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is growing in importance as artificial intelligence becomes more popular. The cloud computing company provides a data-as-a-service platform that helps users store and analyze data points.\n\nAI takes a tremendous amount of computing power. Snowflake can connect multiple public clouds to help companies offering AI services power their applications.\n\nSnowflake’s revenue growth is also impressive. The company’s product revenue grew 34% in the third quarter to $698.5 million. Snowflake expects product revenue of $716 million to $721 million in the fourth quarter, which would be 30% growth from a year ago.\n\nSNOW stock is up 31% in the last year. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nEvery day, more of our lives are online. Be it our finances, medical records or how we work, computers and technology will play an outsized role in our lives. That’s why companies like CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) will be so important and why it’s a solid growth stock.\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides a cloud-based platform called Falcon. The platform operates as a security-as-a-service model that prevents malware and intrusions.\n\nBy using AI to monitor billions of data points at a time, CrowdStrike’s platform can identify unusual behavior and flag it as malicious. Essentially, CrowdStrike can take action to prevent bad actors from hacking data before they have an opportunity to get in.\n\nCrowdStrike’s revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Oct. 31, 2023) was strong, up 35% from a year ago to $786 million. Subscription revenue was up 34% to $733.5 million.\n\nCRWD stock is up 172% in the last year and gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nLive Nation Entertainment (LYV) Twitter account of popular US singer-songwriter Taylor Swift in Twitter website seen in iPhone on Live Nation (LYV) logo background.

It operates in over 45 countries, making it the planet’s biggest producer of live entertainment.\n\nLive Nation is so dominant it’s getting attention in Washington. There’s reportedly a federal investigation of alleged antitrust violations, with investigators seeking to learn if Live Nation forced venues to sign anticompetitive agreements. Congress also is paying attention.\n\nMeanwhile, Live Nation says the third quarter was its best ever. Revenue was $8.2 billion, up 32%% from a year ago. And operating income was up 22% to $619 million.\n\nLive Nation expects double-digit growth in 2024 in both sponsorships and large venue shows, giving it a solid pathway to growth.\n\nLYV stock is up 19% in the last year. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nI remain a big fan of Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), which I think is not only the best Chinese electric vehicle stock on the market, but one of the best auto stocks you can buy overall.\n\nLi delivered over 600,000 vehicles in 2023, tops among China’s new energy automakers. In December, production topped 50,000 for the first time.\n\nLi delivered nearly 132,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, which was an increase of 184% from a year ago.\n\nLi announced a partnership with Nvidia to use their Drive Thor for Li’s next fleet of electric vehicles. Drive Thor is a system for autonomous driving, but can also be used for in-vehicle AI and infotainment systems.\n\nLi should also get a boost early in 2024 with the planned rollout of its new multipurpose vehicle, the Li Mega, on March 1. Orders for the Mega exceeded 10,000 in the first two hours the vehicle was available for reservations.\n\nLI stock is up 44% in the last year. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCameco (CCJ) CCJ Stock: Hand in long yellow glove holding a chunk of uranium material\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/RHJPhtotoandilustration\n\nCameco (NYSE:CCJ) is a uranium company based in Canada. The company has uranium operations in Canada, the U.S. and Kazakhstan.\n\nWhen enriched, uranium is used to power nuclear power plants and nuclear reactors in naval ships and submarines. It can be used as a counterweight for aircraft control surfaces and radiation shielding.\n\nUranium prices have risen, reaching their highest levels since 2007 as demand increases. Analysts believe that prices will rise higher in 2024 as uranium users will be prompted to seek sources outside of Russia, which remains embroiled in Western sanctions because of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCameco also recently completed its acquisition of 49% of Westinghouse Electric, which is one of the world’s biggest nuclear services businesses. The remainder of the company is owned by Brookfield Asset Management.\n\nCameco’s Q3 report showed revenue of $575 million, up 48% from a year ago. The company also had a gross profit of $152 million, up from $25 million in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nCCJ stock is up 96% in the last year.

        "title": "Stop! Don’t Buy AI Stock. There Are Better Options Out There!",
        "content": "C3.ai (NYSE:AI) stock last year became one of the more popular AI plays out there. Compared to other top AI stocks, C3.ai is a considerably smaller enterprise. The stock has a market cap of just $3 billion, and this year the company should generate just $305.5 million in revenue. At the same time, this enterprise isn’t a fly-by-night operation.\n\nFounded by billionaire software entrepreneur Thomas Siebel, and in business for 15 years, I can see why the bulls believe C3.ai could be a dark horse contender in the race to dominate the AI software market. This AI longshot has low chances of success compared to more established AI names.\n\nAI Stock: Mostly Hope and Hype\n\nAdmittedly, there is some substance to the C3.ai bull case. Beyond the factors listed above, there’s the fact that it quickly capitalized on the generative AI trend. As you may recall, last January, the company launched its C3 Generative AI Product Suite.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai also has an existing enterprise AI business, which, while not yet profitable, grew rapidly during the late 2010s/early 2020s. Compared to early-stage AI contenders, this is not an “also-ran” name in the space. Still, while perhaps in the middle of the pack, that’s, of course, not the same thing as being a front-runner.\n\nThe problem, however, is that many in the market are treating AI stock like it is on the verge of leaping toward the head of the pack. Bulls have partially priced in the prospect of C3.ai rapidly cashing in on the generative AI software trend, and shares would likely soar again if such a scenario played out.\n\nUnfortunately, with this aspect of the bull case, recent financials suggest that hope and hype, not substance, is all there is backing it up.\n\nShares Are at Risk of Taking a Big Tumble\n\nLast month, C3.ai released its latest quarterly results, along with updates to guidance. Revenue came in at the low end of prior guidance. Although net losses were narrower than prior forecasts, updates to guidance fell short of expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, the company had plenty to tout in the earnings release. On a sequential basis, revenue growth accelerated, from 11% to 17%.\n\nC3.ai also reported an 81% jump in “customer engagement,” suggested to be a leading indicator of revenue growth ahead. Still, investors reacted negatively, as seen with the performance of AI stock post-earnings.\n\nThis makes sense. Another high-profile AI software company, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR), is also experiencing customer growth far outpacing revenue growth. Yet as I argued recently, even with this burgeoning customer count, it’s very uncertain whether this will translate into a big growth resurgence for Palantir.\n\nThe same may apply here for C3.ai. Unlike PLTR, which is consistently profitable, AI’s future growth may not be enough to sustain its valuation.\n\nBottom Line: For AI Exposure, Stick to the Better Bets Out There\n\nConsidering how much C3.ai has had to walk back earnings and growth expectations, forgive me for being doubtful that 2024 is going to be C3.ai’s “year of AI.”\n\nForgive me for being doubtful that this year will be a banner one for Palantir, either. For now, it appears turning the generative AI trend into high revenue/earnings growth is a lot easier said-than-done.\n\nContrast this with the almost-instantaneous success the AI chips industry is having capitalizing on this trend. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) appear to be more solid ways to wager on the “future of AI,” with a high level of upside potential to boot.\n\nAs AI stock (after dropping considerably from its 2023 highs) could cough back more of its gains, skip on it, and stick to your stronger options.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nThomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

The move aligns with Li’s prior use of Nvidia’s technology and showcases a strategic push toward AI-driven advancements in the EV industry.\n\nNvidia’s latest system-on-a-chip provides 2,000 teraflops of performance, allowing manufacturers to allocate resources for autonomous driving, in-vehicle AI, infotainment, and driver assistance.\n\nLi Auto, alongside major EV makers like Nio and Xpeng, utilizes Nvidia’s advanced Drive Orin SoC, delivering 254 Tops of computing power.\n\nLi Auto’s current models, including the Li L7, Li L8, and Li L9, feature different trim options and employ smart driving chips, such as Horizon Robotics’ Journey 5 with 128 Tops of computing power.\n\nNew Flagship Retails Centers China\n\nLi Auto initiated the construction of flagship retail centers, following a similar concept to Nio’s Nio House. On January 14, Li Auto inaugurated flagship retail centers in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, introducing an upgraded design concept for an enhanced customer experience.\n\nThe centers aim to create a home-like atmosphere, offering spaces for families to explore products and services. Additional flagship retail centers in Beijing and Shanghai are set to be revealed later this month as part of Li Auto’s expansion plan.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi Auto is set to broaden its sales network across China’s Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities, with plans to cover all Tier 3 cities and over 70% of Tier 4 cities by the close of 2024. The company shared images of its two flagship showrooms, resembling Nio Houses with a two-story design.\n\nThe first floor serves as a vehicle display area, while the second floor offers additional spaces, including a drinks area and rest zone. A visit to Li Auto’s Shenzhen flagship retail center revealed a setup akin to Nio House, with two floors dedicated to various functions.\n\nLI Stock Is off to a Great Start\n\nEarlier this month, Li Auto’s CEO aimed for challenging annual deliveries of 800,000 and monthly deliveries of 100,000 in 2024, indicating a 110% increase.

As to the driver of that dinging? Hotter-than-expected economic data, which is currently unfolding.\n\nA week ago, investors had to digest a stronger-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. Markets sold off as rate cut bets were dialed back.\n\nOn Wednesday, markets had to wade through a retail sales report that suggested consumers were still rocking on, and thus inflation won't fall so rapidly. Rate cut bets, you guessed, got pulled in.\n\nStocks were subsequently hit.\n\nOver the last five trading sessions, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is down by 0.5%. The more interest rate-sensitive Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is off by 1.2%, which I think supports the view of a market that has bet the house on a lot of rate cuts this year.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told Yahoo Finance Live at the World Economic Forum (WEF) this week that he's in the camp of four rate cuts in 2024. That's not exactly the six rate cuts many in the market were pricing in at the start of the year.\n\n\"And what you see from policymakers publicly are them not endorsing the idea that we're going to get cuts in the next several months. And I mean, if I were a central banker, I'd probably also be a little bit more noncommittal until I was actually ready to cut pretty soon because you box yourself in by endorsing what is a fairly clear statement of where markets think things are going,\" reminded Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius in a chat at Davos.\n\nAdded Hatzius, \"In terms of the way that people talk about the economy, it's more optimistic than it's been in a long time.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHatzius still expects rate cuts this year, but isn't in the six rate cuts camp either.\n\nThis spells a greater-than-average-risk situation as people try to understand the Fed's thinking and incoming data, in this writer's humble opinion.\n\nPerhaps try to add some fixed income to your portfolio, pros told Yahoo Finance Live at WEF.\n\n\"Fixed income has historically done very well when the Fed has paused and begins their easing cycle, which is exactly where we find ourselves. And so if we're going in that direction, fixed income, particularly investment-grade fixed income, is going to perform very well in that environment,\" Guggenheim Investment Management chief investment officer Anne Walsh told us.\n\nRead the latest from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland:\n\nHow many times the Fed will cut interest rates is a hot topic in Davos IMF managing director on AI's impact: New social safety nets may be needed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on AI's impact on jobs: It's great for white-collar workers, coders Generative AI is miracle technology for profit-hungry CEOs: PwC survey 'Sheer panic' from European leaders on potential second Trump term: Ian Bremmer PepsiCo CEO on leadership, ultra-processed foods, and weight-loss drugs Nasdaq CEO: Financial crime is now a multitrillion-dollar epidemic Davos 2024\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 2 Top AI Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "It is impossible to predict the future, especially in the stock market, but historical patterns do suggest certain outcomes are more likely than not. For instance, analysis of trading data going back to 1971 shows the Nasdaq Composite has risen an average of 19% in the year following a market recovery year like the one that occurred in 2023. Investors looking to buy stocks in 2024 stand to benefit significantly if past trends hold.\n\nTwo semiconductor giants -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) -- could perform particularly well if this Nasdaq uptrend happens. That's because they are also likely to be beneficiaries of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend that gained momentum in 2023 and shows no signs of slowing. Let's take a closer look at these two stocks with historic trends providing them game-changing tailwinds. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nStocks that rise substantially in a relatively short timeframe can be intimidating. Investors don't always have clear indications that the growth will continue. After its share price jumped by a whopping 231% over the last 12 months, Nvidia is the exception here. It isn't too late to bet on the market leader because its long-term AI opportunity is just getting started. Compared to its potential, Nvidia's valuation remains reasonable.\n\nUnlike some other AI stocks, Nvidia's 2023 rally was based on fundamentals, not hype. Fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue (for the period ending Oct. 29, 2023) soared by a jaw-dropping 206% year over year to $18.12 billion, driven by relentless demand for its flagship H100 chips to power and run generative AI applications. And even though Nvidia will face more competition over the coming years, its economic moat is strong because of its massive developer community, which has built software and servers optimized around its hardware.\n\nNvidia's AI efforts also include the automotive industry. Just this month management announced a partnership with Mercedes Benz Group to work on self-driving cars. While a fully functional version of this technology could be years away, it highlights Nvidia's potential to expand and diversify the use cases for its chips through continued innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite all these incredible tailwinds going into 2024 and beyond, Nvidia trades for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 27, which is slightly lower than the Nasdaq average P/E of 29.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nSince it acquired ATI Technologies in 2006, AMD has competed with Nvidia in the consumer graphics processing unit (GPU) market for video game graphics, typically aiming for affordable pricing and solid performance against its cutting-edge rival. Now, it can use these same strategies to claim a slice of the much more lucrative opportunity in AI-related chips.\n\nAccording to AMD's CEO Lisa Su, the $45 billion AI chip market could soar to $400 billion by 2027. To tackle this opportunity, the company has released its family of MI300X GPUs designed to compete with Nvidia's H100 on tasks including training and running generative AI applications.\n\nSo far, new AI chips have had a muted impact on AMD's results, with third-quarter revenue up by just 4% year over year to $5.8 billion. However, the company expects the new products to generate additional sales of $2 billion in 2024. And this could rapidly scale as it increases production.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 39, AMD stock would be considered expensive given its modest growth rate. But investors who buy it now are betting on what performance could look like over the coming years if the AI market reaches even a fraction of what are some lofty projections.\n\nWhich stock is better for you?\n\nIn 2024 and beyond, Nvidia and AMD will enter direct competition in the market for AI data-center chips. But this isn't necessarily a zero-sum game because the overall market is growing incredibly fast, and both companies have plenty of room to establish their respective niches.\n\nWith that said, Nvidia stock is trading significantly cheaper than its rival from a valuation perspective. And while it isn't too late to bet on either company's long-term potential, AMD will have to work much harder to justify its premium.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "TSMC Outlook Drives $165 Billion Chip Rally in 2024 Rebound Bet",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor stocks from Tokyo Electron Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. gained more than $160 billion of market value after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s outlook for capital spending and revenue lifted hopes of a broad tech recovery in 2024.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken’s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Pakistan’s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Nasdaq 100 Hits Record High in Tech-Fueled Rebound: Markets Wrap\n\nTSMC’s better-than-projected numbers underscored expectations for a bounce-back in smartphone, chip and computing demand, following more than a year of post-Covid malaise. On Friday, the world’s most valuable chipmaker gained more than 6% in Taipei — its biggest gain in almost a year — after a near-10% climb in the US. Key suppliers Tokyo Electron and Advantest Corp. gained more than 5% in Tokyo. Together, they fueled a gain in semiconductor stocks from the US to Asia of roughly $165 billion, based on Bloomberg’s calculations.\n\nTSMC’s outlook offered much-needed reassurance to investors accustomed to a depressed market. The main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia is budgeting capital expenditure of $28 billion to $32 billion and expecting revenue growth to return to at least 20% for the year. Executives also spent a lot of time talking about how the advent of AI should turbocharge the industry because of its immense computing needs.\n\nIn Europe, chip gear linchpin ASML Holding NV gained 4%, leading a broad regional rally that spilled over into US stocks including Nvidia and Intel Corp., driving the biggest gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index since Dec. 11.\n\n“TSMC’s confidence around near-term fundamentals appears to have improved significantly over the past 4 to 5 months,” Wedbush analysts wrote. “We see this more bullish outlook as predicated upon some combination of optimism around a growing contribution from AI, better expectations for traditional end market trends in 2024.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC Gains as Outlook Points to AI-Fueled Growth: Street Wrap\n\nSigns of a recovery for the chipmaking sector have emerged in recent weeks. The Semiconductor Industry Association estimated chip sales increased in November after more than a year of declines. TSMC is projecting revenue growth of at least 8% to $18 billion to $18.8 billion in the March quarter, versus expectations for around $18.2 billion.\n\nIt’s now moving ahead with plans for chipmaking plants in Japan, Arizona and Germany — the first of which will begin mass production at the end of 2024 in a big boost to TSMC’s global footprint.\n\nRead More: TSMC’s Outlook Backs Hopes for Global Tech Recovery in 2024\n\nUncertainty persists. This month, fellow chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co. posted its sixth successive quarter of declining operating profit, as it weathered the impact of muted consumer demand in its own smartphone and memory businesses.\n\nQuestions also overshadow China, the world’s largest computing, smartphone, internet and chip market.\n\nApple — long one of TSMC’s most important customers — faced headwinds with its latest iPhone generation. Several analysts downgraded Apple on expectations of soft demand, and Jefferies has said the iPhone sales slump in China is likely to deepen. The US company has also been hit by a widening ban on foreign-device use among Chinese agencies and state-owned companies.\n\nTSMC Gain in Sales Not Enough to Boost Margins: Earnings Outlook\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "Amidst high inflation, interest rates, and reduced EV demand, the U.S. market recorded a record 1.2 million EV sales in 2023. However, Chinese EV producers came out ahead, reporting stellar numbers and leading the way in terms of market share. For cost-conscious investors, exploring potential next-gen EV leaders is vital in 2024.\n\nDespite temporary challenges like heightened competition, macroeconomic factors, and supply-chain issues, the EV sector presents fresh entry points. With geopolitical tensions impacting growth, undervalued EV stocks offer diversified investment opportunities beyond car makers.\n\nByd Co. (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett-backed BYD Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is the world’s largest EV seller and second-largest battery maker. It achieved impressive Q4 deliveries of 526,000 EVs, marking its dominance. So, with a 100% year-over-year (YOY) profit surge, expanding international exports, and plans for new factories, BYDDF presents a compelling investment opportunity at $26.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite Byd Co.’s record-breaking EV sales, surpassing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the latest quarter, the Chinese EV maker’s shares have plummeted 45% from the 2022 peak. Also, concerns have arisen due to price wars, slowing sales growth, and increased discounts in the competitive market.\n\nHowever, BYDDF’s global market presence and diverse EV lineup, including plug-in hybrids, contribute to a robust market share. Despite a recent market dip, BYDDF has strong financial indicators and impressive vehicle deliveries. And those position it as a compelling Tesla competitor, emphasizing affordability without compromising quality.\n\nIn 2023, Byd Co. achieved substantial YOY growth, selling 3.02 million vehicles and reinforcing its global standing in the expanding EV market.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC), or Lithium Argentina, exceeded its 2023 production goal at the Caucharí-Olaroz lithium brine operation in Argentina.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy producing nearly 6,000 tons of lithium carbonate, it surpasses the initial 5,000-tonne target. The plant operates at half capacity. And ongoing efforts are boosting production and improving product quality. Also, the potassium chloride (KCl) plant is operational, with plans to increase production.\n\nLithium Americas presents potential for significant growth, trading at $6 per share at the time of writing. Despite challenges in the lithium sector, gradual accumulation is advisable. Keep in mind its ownership of the Thacker Pass project, the largest known measured lithium resource in the U.S. With a $5.7 billion after-tax net present value, and General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) $650 million investment and ten-year off take agreement, the current $1 billion market valuation seems undervalued.\n\nRegular shipments commenced in October. Also, Lithium Americas plans to release Q4 and full-year 2023 financial results on March 21, 2024. Executive Chair John Kanellitsas expressed satisfaction with the project’s transition to operations. He especially emphasizes the goal of reaching full capacity in 2024 and enabling further growth.\n\nLi Auto (LI) An image of an AV delivery truck, a cityscape in the background\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov/Shutterstock\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) exceeds revenue expectations with robust December deliveries of 50,353 vehicles.\n\nImpressively, that marks a 137% YOY increase. Also, Q4 deliveries reached 131,805, up 184% YOY, setting the stage for a strong quarter. Therefore, the company anticipates Q4 revenue between $5.27 billion to $5.40 billion.\n\nThe Chinese EV company emerges as the top-selling SUV brand above 300,000 yuan in China for November, with 41,800 units sold. This marks the eighth consecutive month of Li Auto’s dominance in this category. In the over 200,000 yuan segment, Li Auto has secured second place in the market.\n\nWith ambitious December sales goals, Li Auto aims to maintain its lead in these price classes until year-end. A recent collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for autonomous driving, utilizing Nvidia’s DRIVE Thor, holds promise for future growth, consolidating multiple functions into a single AI platform. With all of these under LI, the future looks bright and clear for the company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks With the Potential to Rise 200% by 2025",
        "content": "The technology space is pulsating with potential, and investors are keenly eyeing AI stocks that promise substantial returns. Three companies stand out as formidable contenders for a staggering 200% rise in this realm.\n\nThe first one has a solid moat in the cybersecurity domain, boasting a 20% growth rate and a strategic shift towards recurring revenue. Meanwhile, the second one’s innovative digital tools and robust performance metrics position it as a leader in the healthcare sector. Lastly, the third company’s strategic focus on AI applications and adaptable product portfolio reveals a company ready to ride the wave of technological evolution.\n\nThe article dives into these tech titans’ core strategies, growth indicators, and market positions. Read more to learn the potential behind their meteoric rise in the AI-driven future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) delivers solid operational performance. For instance, the topline has a 20% growth (during Q1 fiscal 2024). This growth demonstrates the company’s capability to capture a larger share of the cybersecurity market. Notably, the cybersecurity sector is highly competitive, but its 20% growth rate suggests the company is retaining its existing client base and attracting new ones.\n\nAdditionally, Palo Alto’s revenue growth is a positive signal. As industries increasingly prioritize digital transformation, there is always a need for robust cybersecurity measures. Palo Alto appears edgy to capitalize on this trend. In the same direction, there is a 16% growth in billings for Q1, which underscores the fundamental strength of Palo Alto. The growth of billings is vital for subscription-based giants like Palo Alto. Hence, this bill increase suggests that Palo Alto is progressively securing new contracts from its clientele.\n\nFurthermore, there is an increase in remaining performance obligations (RPO) by 26%. It has reached $10.4 billion, a vital indicator of Palo Alto’s capability to secure future revenue. Palo Alto achieved a considerable milestone with Next-Generation Security (NGS), with Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) exceeding $3 billion, representing a 53% growth. Next-generation security is a key focus area for the company. Thus, the substantial increase in ARR suggests market demand for the company’s advanced cybersecurity solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, there is a shift towards recurring revenue, an important move for Palo Alto. Here, 83% of total revenue now comes from recurring sources, up from 77% a year ago. For Palo Alto, the increase in recurring revenue aligns with the broader industry trend; subscription-based services are increasing. Therefore, this model provides a steady income and enhances market valuation.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is a strong momentum behind Intuitive Surgical’s (NASDAQ:ISRG) digital tools. These tools include surgical simulators, the My Intuitive app, and the Intuitive Hub media management and telepresence system. These tools play a vital role in the broader ecosystem and contribute to the company’s focus on improving the quadruple aim.\n\nAdditionally, the routine use of the My Intuitive app experienced a substantial 140% year-over-year growth in Q3 2023. In the same direction, intuitive hub installations grew by 58% and captured surgical cases increased by 61% year-over-year. Hence, these metrics suggest a strong acceptance and adoption of Intuitive Surgical’s digital offerings.\n\nThe company’s outlook aligns with the potential level of hospital procedure volumes. For 2023, the expected procedure growth is 21% to 22%, with a pro forma gross profit margin that may hit 68% to 68.5%. The company’s performance is on a growth trajectory in the United States, with 12% revenue growth in Q3 and a 23% pro forma earnings per share increase.\n\nMoreover, Intuitive Surgical’s capital placement trends and the shift towards leasing illustrate the strategic use of leasing programs. In Q3, 312 systems were placed, reflecting demand for multiport systems, continued interest in Ion, and a modest acceleration in single port (SP) placements. The acceleration in leasing, particularly in the U.S., is attributed to the convenience of the program and the maturity of Generation 4 multiport systems.\n\nFinally, the 6% growth rate in system utilization is defined as procedures per installed system per quarter. Although this growth rate is slightly down from Q2, it remains above historical growth rates. Higher utilization is associated with shorter average procedure times and improved scheduling efficiency. Therefore, the higher utilization is economically healthy for intuitive surgery, contributing to increased investment capital returns.\n\nSuper Micro (SMCI) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSuper Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) strategically focuses on AI, positioning it as a leader in providing solutions tailored to the burgeoning market demand for AI applications. In detail, the primary growth driver for the company is the demand for its leading AI platforms, especially in plug-and-play rack-scale configurations. The focus on LLM-optimized NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) HGX-H100 solutions suggests Super Micro’s focus on staying at the edge of tech advancements.\n\nFundamentally, Super Micro capitalizes on tight AI GPU and key component supply conditions. The company’s agility and capability to address challenges head-on are critical fundamentals in an industry where demand often outstrips supply. To survive, companies need to pivot quickly to meet rapid demand. In short, Super Micro’s success in delivering total solutions and large compute clusters in the face of supply challenges indicates a robust supply chain edge.\n\nIn detail, the company has a broad AI solution portfolio featuring products from leading providers such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and NVIDIA, which speaks to its focus on offering customers a diverse range of options. This expands Super Micro’s market reach and positions it as a one-stop solution provider for various AI computing needs. Thus, the company’s adaptable product portfolio is a strategic advantage in an industry with rapid innovation.\n\nFinally, Super Micro’s investment in expanding validation and production facilities further solidifies its position in the AI market. By dedicating capacity to manufacturing 100-kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, the company is preparing to hit on AI infrastructure potential. In short, the focus on continuous improvement and scalability may continue pushing the market valuation.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in INTC.

        "content": "Positive fourth-quarter earnings results for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) boosted other chip stocks, with investors hoping it could potentially be a sign of the end of trouble for the sector. However, mixed economic reports out of China disappointed many on Wall Street. It calls into question what investors need to consider when investing in China-exposed companies.\n\nJames Early, BBAE Chief Investment Officer, and Dory Wiley, Commerce Street Capital President, joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Chinese markets and what investors should keep their eyes on.\n\nEarly affirms: \"I don't think the Chinese economy is a big driver for semis [semiconductors].

So they're moving the wrong direction.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nMADISON MILLS: Zeroing in on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor jumping today, boosting other chip stocks, as fourth quarter results suggest that the worst could be over for the sector. Now, that comes after economic data out of China disappoints. And weak demand out of that region pulling down even some of those beloved Magnificent Seven stocks. So which story is going to drive stocks this earnings season, China's economy or the company fundamentals?\n\nStory continues\n\nWe're going to bring in James Early, BBAE Chief Investment Officer. We've also got Dory Wiley, President and CEO of Commerce Street Capital, joining us on this. Thank you both so much for being here. James, I want to start off with you. We had that great news on TSMC driving up the stocks index today. Bad news, though, out of China. And you're a great person to talk to on this because of the amount of time you've spent over in that region. So I'm curious, what do you think will impact the future of this index, the semis index specifically more, that news coming out of China or the company's specific news?\n\nJAMES EARLY: I think it's going to be the company's specific news. I don't think the Chinese economy is a big driver for semis. The driver there is probably regulation. But going back to the Chinese economy, I would liken it to the adult child who's trying to move out of his parents' basement but is just having trouble doing that. And by that, I mean the economy had been trying to get on its own feet in a consumer spending sense. It's about 53% of the economy right now, whereas the US is about 68%.\n\nBut they're just struggling, Madison. They're struggling. And so they're going back to that government playbook of heavy spending, heavy infrastructure spending, to try to drive the economy. That's why the market's down. For the semis specifically, though, those things are not driven by consumer demand. That's more of like a Starbucks story or maybe a Tesla or an Apple story. The semis are trying to-- they're trying to do as much buying as they can, the consumers of the semis, before more regulations strike.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And, Dory, let's bring you in here as well and stick with that semi theme here because one name you like, Dory, is NVIDIA. Obviously, a lot of people like NVIDIA, Dory. Its stock is up about 230% in the past 12 months. What do you think, Dory, as an NVIDIA bull, what do you think the near to intermediate term catalysts are here for this stock? And what do you think also the risks investors should consider before piling in here?\n\nDORY WILEY: Well, you know, kind of going with the overall theme here, it's really AI, right? And so if you're a money manager, you got to have exposure to Mag Seven. And if you have exposure to Mag Seven, you got to have exposure to NVIDIA. And AI is very real, and it's going to be even more real going forward. Now, these other semiconductors, you know, I like-- I like TSM. I like some of these others.\n\nYou know, it's really-- but I don't like the exposure to China. I don't like it right now. China's almost uninvestable. And that's hard to hear from an investing point of view because we try to keep politics out of it. But there's so many fundamental reasons to try to avoid China as much as we can. So the less exposure I have to China, the more I'm into AI and semiconductors.\n\nThat's kind of what I'm looking for because China, there's just-- I mean, exports are down, population is down. The market's down 30%. It's the third straight year. Real estate debt issues, government debt issues, no new construction, no-- and their politics has gone from a party dictatorship to a person dictatorship. So they're moving the wrong direction. And then what no one's really talking about is all the price deflation that's going on over there, and it's pretty severe.",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Major Asian chipmaking and technology stocks rose sharply on Friday, tracking better than expected earnings from TSMC and as the chipmaking giant also flagged a positive outlook on AI demand.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) rose over 5% in Taiwan trade to a near two-year high, after it clocked a smaller-than-expected decline in its fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nCEO C.C. Wei said on Thursday TSMC was well-positioned to capitalize on a boom in artificial intelligence development over the coming year, and that it was already seeing improved demand for its most advanced chips.\n\n\"We expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by [...] robust AI-related demand. AI models need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware [...] thus the value of TSMC's technology position is increasing,\" Wei said in a post-earnings call.\n\nHis comments triggered buying into several other Asian chipmaking stocks on Friday. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) and SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which manufacture memory chips that are used in AI computing, rose over 3% each.\n\nJapan’s Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857), which makes semiconductor testing equipment, rose over 8%, while chipmaker Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035) surged nearly 5%. China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co, or SMIC, added nearly 3% in Hong Kong trade.\n\nU.S. chipmaking majors also rebounded on Thursday after TSMC’s outlook, with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is at the heart of an AI-driven boom in chip demand, up nearly 2% in overnight trade. Nvidia has clocked a series of consensus-beating quarterly earnings on support from AI-fueled demand.\n\nTMSC’s outlook pushed up hopes that increased interest in AI development will help offset a nearly two-year slump in the tech industry, which was triggered by high interest rates and decreased appetite for consumer electronics.\n\nIncrease in AI was kickstarted by the release of OpenAI's Chat GPT tool in late-2022, which spurred a rush among major tech companies to come up with their own similar offerings. Speculation over the potential applications for generative AI also spurred increased interest in the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowing uncertainty over U.S. interest rates saw most major tech stocks log a weak start to 2024, as signs of sticky U.S. inflation and labor market strength spurred doubts that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates early in 2024.\n\nStill, tech is expected to benefit in 2024 from the Fed eventually kicking off a rate-cut cycle, although the timing and the scope of the rate cuts remains unclear.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

Rival Advanced Micro Devices also notched a record high.\n\nBroadcom, Qualcomm and Marvell Technology gained. The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index rallied and approached its December 2023 record high.\n\nApple jumped after BofA Global Research upgraded the iPhone maker's stock to \"buy\" from \"neutral.\" That helped the S&P 500 information technology index reach a record high.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 41.32 points, or 0.87%, to end at 4,780.53 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 200.19 points, or 1.35%, to 15,055.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 202.00 points, or 0.54%, to 37,468.67.\n\nData showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to a late-2022 low, suggesting solid job growth in January.\n\nJake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, said he has recently been more conservative with his clients' money as investors become less sure the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in March.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost ground on Tuesday and Wednesday following strong December retail sales data and after policymakers talked down expectations for an early start to rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"People are starting to say, 'Hey, we've made the assumption the Fed is going to start cutting in March, but will they, and what does it look like if they don't?'\" Dollarhide said.\n\nTraders now see a 56% chance for a 25-basis-point rate cut in March, compared with a chance above 80% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nInterest rate-sensitive sectors dipped, with the S&P 500 real estate index and utilities index among the deepest sector decliners.\n\nAtlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said he was open to reducing rates sooner than he had anticipated if there is \"convincing\" evidence in coming months that inflation is falling faster than he expected. Bostic had previously said he expected it would be appropriate to cut rates in the second half of 2024.\n\nHumana dropped after the health insurer forecast fourth-quarter medical costs to be higher than previously expected. Peer UnitedHealth also fell.\n\nKeyCorp dropped after the lender posted a decline in fourth-quarter profit, while Birkenstock sank almost 9% after missing quarterly profit expectations.\n\nSpirit Airlines tumbled after Citigroup downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from \"neutral.\" (Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California Additional reporting by Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "As chip companies continue to capitalize on the generative AI growth trend, semiconductor stocks remain popular with investors. Yet while there is much in the way of news and developments out there signaling which companies are benefiting the most from AI, you may also want names that are in the “Green Zone.”\n\nTradeSmith offers investors valuable tools for determining which stocks to watch. A good example is its Health Indicator feature. This comprehensive indicator provides an overall rating of a stock’s current health.\n\nUsing this metric, you can quickly find potential opportunities to explore. Broken down into three “zones” (green, yellow, and red), you’ll have a general idea about whether it’s best to be bullish, bearish, or neutral on a particular stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs you may have guessed, stocks in the “Green Zone” are performing well, with little indication that the trend is on the verge of shifting.\n\nA stock in the “Yellow Zone” has corrected by more than 50% of its volatility quotient (VQ), a proprietary TradeSmith metric that helps measure a stock’s risk. When a stock in your portfolio goes from green to yellow, it may be a good time to reassess whether to maintain the position.\n\nStocks entering the “Red Zone” have corrected by more than their calculated volatility quotient. VQ can be useful when adding stop losses to your positions. View any move into the “Red Zone” as a warning sign to exit your position for now.\n\nWith this, let’s take a look at three top semiconductor stocks, each of which is currently in the “Green Zone.”\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor stock that has been in the “Green Zone” for over 11 months. Its time in the “Green Zone” coincides with its emergence as a top way to play the AI trend.\n\nNvidia has made the most progress capitalizing on soaring demand for generative AI chips, resulting in very high levels of growth. For instance, during Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter (ending in October), revenue was up 206% year over year and earnings were up 1,259% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Nvidia’s growth during the current fiscal year will likely decelerate from the prior year’s levels, said growth may be sufficient to keep on moving the needle. Forecasts call for revenue growth of nearly 55%, and earnings growth of around 62.8%. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for NVDA is 42.07%, which makes it a high-risk stock.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been in the “Green Zone” for over two months. AMD shares soared throughout 2023 due to rising excitement about AMD’s potential to capitalize on the above-mentioned AI trend.\n\nBullishness for AMD stock has continued. This is largely due to the company’s launch of its Instinct MI300 line of AI-compatible accelerators. While Advanced Micro Devices has conservatively estimated that this product line will bring in around $2 billion in revenue this year, one analyst believes sales could top $8 billion during 2024. AMD has also recently unveiled an AI PC chip.\n\nThe prospect of its initial success handily exceeding guidance signals that this stock’s wave of strong performance may not be over just yet. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for AMD is 40.03%, which makes it a high-risk stock.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An image of the front of a three story building with the blue logo for \"Micron\" with grass and trees in front on a clear sunny day.\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has been in the “Green Zone” for over a month. Rising bullishness about Micron’s AI potential helps to explain why this memory chip maker has become one of the semiconductor stocks in the “Green Zone.”\n\nThe rapid adoption of generative AI technology has resulted in a big jump in memory chip demand. As seen in the company’s latest fiscal results, this trend is helping Micron bounce back after experiencing a severe drop in sales, and big net losses, due to the tech slowdown.\n\nLast quarter, sales were up by around 18% quarter over quarter. While not for certain, this growth trend, coupled with an overall rebound in memory and storage chip demand, may result in a revenue recovery, a return to profitability, and higher prices ahead for MU stock. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for MU is 32.57%, which makes it a high-risk stock.\n\nThe TradeSmith Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nTradeSmith’s mission is to put easy-to-use, technology-based tools into the hands of individual, self-directed investors. TradeSmith began as a simple way to track portfolios using trailing stops and has evolved to become a powerful suite of risk-management and portfolio analysis tools.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Growth investing is a highly common strategy deployed, with investors targeting companies expected to grow their earnings and revenues at an above-average level. It’s a development that commonly follows through to share outperformance.\n\nOf course, the strategy can be volatile. Still, we can find stability by targeting companies with positive earnings estimate revisions, effective management (ROE), and healthy liquidity.\n\nFor those interested in stocks that fit the criteria – FirstCash FCFS, OneSpaWorld OSW, and NVIDIA NVDA – could all be considered.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\nNVIDIA\n\nInvestor-favorite NVIDIA continues to be a prime selection for those with an appetite for growth, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting nearly 270% earnings growth paired with a 120% revenue climb. Peeking ahead to FY25, earnings and revenue are forecasted to see additional growth of 63% and 53%, respectively.\n\nAnalysts continue raising their expectations for the company, helping it keep its favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nData Center sales have been the primary focus among investors concerning NVDA, which includes revenue from AI chips. The company’s Data Center sales soared a sizable 280% year-over-year throughout its latest quarter to a quarterly record of $14.5 billion.\n\nAnd the company’s bright growth trajectory has been reflected by its remarkable share performance, with shares up 240% over the last year vs. the S&P 500’s nearly 25% climb. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFirstCash Holdings\n\nFirstCash (Ticker: FCFS) is one of the world's largest pawn shop operators and a leading provider of technology-driven point-of-sale (POS) payment solutions. The company’s earnings are forecasted to climb 13% on 15% higher revenues in its current year (FY23), with FY24 expectations suggesting an additional 21% bump in earnings paired with an 8% sales climb.\n\nOn top of healthy growth, the stock pays a solid dividend, currently yielding 1.3% annually. The company has grown its payout nicely as well, boasting a 7.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFirstCash’s growth has been aided by an expanding footprint, with the company adding 104 new pawn stores just throughout its latest quarter. Concerning headline expectations, FCFS posted an 11% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate and reported revenue 2.5% ahead of expectations.\n\nThe company’s quarterly consistency can’t be overlooked, beating our consensus EPS estimates in 17 consecutive quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOneSpaWorld\n\nOneSpaWorld is a provider and innovator in the fields of wellness, beauty, rejuvenation, and transformation on cruise ships and land. The stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the revisions trend for its current fiscal year particularly bullish, up 40% to $0.67 per share over the last year.\n\nThe current value suggests 140% year-over-year earnings growth, with the top line also forecasted to witness a 45% expansion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOneSpaWorld latest quarterly report was solid, with revenues climbing 33% year-over-year to a record $216 million and operating income of $17 million also reflecting a quarterly record. The company has consistently posted better-than-expected results as of late, exceeding our consensus EPS estimates by an average of 20% across its last four.\n\nShares got a nice boost following the release and look to continue their momentum into the next print scheduled for late February. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAbove-average sales and earnings growth commonly leads to share outperformance, undoubtedly a welcomed development among investors.\n\nAnd while growth investing can be volatile, picking companies with effective management and healthy liquidity positions helps to mitigate the concern.\n\nAll three stocks above – FirstCash FCFS, OneSpaWorld OSW, and NVIDIA NVDA – fit the criteria nicely.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Adds detail on infrastructure investments, product roadmap in paragraphs 9-10)\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that the company was bringing its AI research team \"closer together\" with a more business-focused generative AI team launched last year, doubling down on a push to get the technology into products.\n\nThe social media giant was building out its infrastructure to accommodate the push and planned to have about 350,000 H100 GPUs (graphics processing units) from chip designer Nvidia by the end of the year, Zuckerberg said in posts on Meta's Instagram and Threads platforms.\n\nIn combination with equivalent chips from other suppliers, Meta will have about 600,000 total GPUs by the end of the year, he said.\n\nThat amount would make Meta's system, once finished, among the largest in the technology industry.\n\nBy contrast, Amazon last autumn said it was building out a system with 100,000 of its Trainium2 chips, while Oracle brought online a system with 32,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to specify which GPU suppliers the company was using aside from market leader Nvidia, though it has said publicly it also plans to use chips from AMD. Reuters has previously reported it has an internally designed GPU-like chip in the works, as well.\n\nMeta has scrambled to build out its computing arsenal to support a mobilization around generative AI this past year, after years of producing leading research on the technology through its FAIR team but scant focus on building it into its core social media products and AR/VR hardware devices.\n\nThe company convened a \"GenAI\" team last year to lead an effort to change that after the breakout success of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022.\n\nSince then, Meta has launched a commercial version of its Llama large language model, ad tools that can generate image backgrounds from text prompts and a \"Meta AI\" chatbot that can be accessed directly via its Ray-Ban smart glasses.\n\nIn his posts on Thursday, Zuckerberg said the company was currently training a third version of the Llama model.\n\nHe also tied the AI investments back to the pivot to the AR/VR-driven metaverse vision that inspired him to change the company's name to Meta in 2021, saying people would \"need new devices\" like glasses for interacting with AI.

        "content": "The key drivers of the late 2023 stock market rally have faded.\n\nWith investors increasingly questioning when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, the so-called \"soft landing\" trade which saw investors pour into interest-rate sensitive sectors has stumbled to start 2024.\n\nThat raises the question of what the next catalyst is — and investors may not need to look further than the tech sector (XLK). Despite the recent craze over small caps and other hot trades that could benefit from Fed's interest rate cuts, technology earnings over the next few weeks will still be key to bringing the market out of its January slump.\n\nTo Keith Lerner, the co-CIO at Truist, it's a simple math equation. With the tech sector representing nearly 30% of the S&P 500, by far the largest portion of any the eleven sectors, and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks alone comprising nearly 30% of the index's market cap, movements in those areas remain crucial for investors in the broader indexes.\n\n\"With the concentration that you still have, I think, tech showing the earnings and the ability to grow earnings at a good pace, even if we have a step down in growth is very important to keep this market moving forward,\" Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday ahead of tech earnings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) took the lead role on Thursday as the chipmaker, which supplies to the likes of Apple (APPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported quarterly results before the opening bell that beat estimates.\n\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.48 came in higher than Wall Street's expectations for $1.38. And, perhaps more importantly, the chipmaker said artificial intelligence is fueling its success. Taiwan Semiconductor said it expects revenue to grow 20% in 2024 due in part to AI demand.\n\nThe news sent the semiconductor index (^SOX) nearly 3% higher while Nvidia (NVDA), whose weighting in the S&P 500 is nearly as big asthe entire energy sector, shot up over 2% before paring gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe move in semiconductors, combined with an upgrade on Apple (AAPL) stock from Bank of America, sent shares of the iPhone maker nearly 3% higher. Analyst Wamsi Mohan moved his rating to Buy from Neutral and bumped his price target to $225 from $208 citing artificial intelligence and the new Vision Pro headset as key drivers.\n\nStock moves in Apple and chips sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) up more than 1% on Thursday morning while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added more than 0.5% before comments from a Fed official on rate cuts not coming until the third quarter tempered gains.\n\nThe research from BofA marked a reversal in the recent narrative on Wall Street that's seen analysts turn bearish on Apple amid questions about iPhone demand, among other issues. And it comes at a critical point ahead of Apple's earnings release, slated for Feb. 1.\n\nOther tech giants are also expected to report in the next two weeks, beginning with Netflix on Jan. 23 and Wall Street strategists expects those reports to serve a critical juncture for the market.\n\n\"Companies have cut costs throughout the earnings recession,\" BofA equity strategist Ohsung Kwon told Yahoo Finance in early January about what could drive stocks higher. \"They have managed margins. Margins went up for the second straight quarter. So I think the momentum is to the upside and if companies talk more positively this earning season, given that the rate pressure and the macro uncertainty has eased somewhat. Now, that's going to be bullish for equities.\"\n\nFor now, technology is the sector checking those boxes and leading the averages higher with it.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "By Caroline Valetkevitch\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - An index of semiconductor stocks was up more than 2% on Thursday and chip stocks were helping the broader market after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing cited strong demand for high-end chips used in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nU.S.-listed shares of the world's largest contract semiconductor maker, which also forecast more than 20% growth in 2024 revenue, were last up 7.2%, the biggest percentage gainer for the day on the semiconductor index. The S&P 500 was up 0.3%.\n\nThe semiconductor index rose 65% in 2023 and hit an all-time intraday high on Dec. 28 of 4,233.73, boosting the overall market amid optimism over AI demand.\n\n\"With basic semiconductors - that's a supply and demand business... but I think you're going to continue to hear chatter about AI, and it will translate into huge revenue growth for a lot of these companies,\" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.\n\n\"To me, we're in the early stages still of a technological revolution.\"\n\nOn Jan. 8, shares of the world's most valuable chipmaker, Nvidia, surged to a then record close after it unveiled new desktop graphics processors taking advantage of AI. Nvidia is viewed as the leading supplier of processors used in AI computing.\n\nNvidia's shares were last up about 1% after hitting a fresh record peak on the session. The stock is up about 14% to start the year after having more than tripled in 2023.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch, editing by Lance Tupper and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) — or TSMC — shares continue to rise Thursday morning as the chipmaker forecasts up to 20% full-year revenue growth for 2024. Examining TSMC's fourth-quarter earnings, Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley looks ahead to what the semiconductor landscape in 2024 could look like for TSMC and customers like Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, we are talking about chips today, with shares of Taiwan Semiconductor jumping and boosting other chip stocks as its fourth quarter results suggest that the worst may be over for the sector. TSMC forecasting solid growth for 2024, seeing a revenue increase in the low mid 20% range driven by huge AI demand.\n\nWe have our very own Dan Howley joining us on those results. Dan, you know, we've been talking so much about the slump that we have seen in chips from slow PC sales, slow smartphone sales. There's a lot riding on those AI devices. What do we learn from TSMC today?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah. It's really the AI kind of that we're seeing. And the discussion of AI in general seems to be kind of actually getting rolling when it comes to the likes of laptops, desktops, smartphones. And don't forget the server side of things. So obviously, Akiko, you were at CES. You saw the huge amount of devices and companies talking about AI, how it's going to be infused into every kind of product that's available. Some of that is going to be vaporware.\n\nBut when it comes to things like chips, laptops, desktops, those companies are moving full steam. And they're going to need some manufacturers to provide those chips. So TSMC obviously working with the likes of AMD and Nvidia. So that's going to be very helpful for them. In fact, NVIDIA for CES had specifically said that they're basically building AI PCs on their own and have been for some time just because of the fact that they run their graphics processors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd then on the flip side of things, on the smartphone side, we're seeing more companies start to push AI as a smartphone component. Yesterday, we saw Samsung launch its new Galaxy line of smartphones. They have Galaxy AI, which they point to as a huge benefit for Samsung. Part of that is powered by Google's AI capability. So you know, it's becoming a real selling point for the companies, whether or not that translates to consumers. We still have to see those phones go on sale later at the end of this month.\n\nGoogle already sells its own smartphones with some of those capabilities. But we'll see really what it hits the mainstream with Samsung. Google doesn't really have that big of a market share. So yeah, I mean, this really shows that the generative AI play is starting to work its way from the hype, the discussion of what it could do, to actual products now hitting the market.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So Dan, what does Taiwan Semi success mean for its customers like Apple and Nvidia? Does that tend to translate?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, it generally does, right? This is something where-- especially for NVIDIA at this point, they're putting out new chips, new hardware for consumers and enterprise. The difference between the enterprise and the consumer is when it comes to enterprise, they go for thousands of dollars. But they don't sell in huge amounts like the consumer side of things. But they're worth a lot more.\n\nSo obviously, it's a better play for them. But the consumer side is going to see some boost because NVIDIA just announced some new chips at CES. So that's going to mean more sales for them. Hopefully for Nvidia, that means that they'll start to see the gaming side really pick up again with these chips are getting very good reviews so far.\n\nAnd then for Apple, you know, what we're going to likely see is some form of generative AI capabilities in the next line of iPhones if not the one after that. So we're talking iPhone 16. We have the current model is the 15. We could see some more push into generative AI there. And obviously, that would mean more powerful processors, more powerful chips for the next generation of iPhones which TSMC takes care of for the most part.\n\nSo I think for Apple in general, they're not going to specifically call out generative AI, at least if they stick to their MO, which is to not call out the technology itself, but rather the features that it enables. Regardless, if they do have features that are powered by generative AI even if they're not mentioning it, it would be a good thing for TSMC because it would mean more powerful chips, apple putting in a lot more orders, people wanted to get those devices.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's certainly good timing considering all the devices people bought during COVID, and they're probably due for a refresh right about now. Appreciate you as always, our very own Dan Howley.",

        "title": "7 Tech Stocks Set to Skyrocket on Strong AI Chip Demand",
        "content": "So much for a chip dip? Taiwan Semiconductor Company (NYSE:TSM), one of the world’s largest chip foundries, issued a strong outlook for 2024 Thursday, news that sent its shares surging 8%. Investors were excited by the fact that Taiwan Semi said it expected revenue to be up more than 20% this year.\n\nThe solid sales guidance from Taiwan Semi is a particularly good sign for the rest of the tech sector, especially customers that use its chips. That includes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is by far the biggest customer of TSMC, accounting for 23% of its total sales in 2022. Shares of Apple rose 3% Thursday. But it’s not the only big tech stock piggybacking off Taiwan Semi’s gains.\n\nTaiwan Semi Lifts Chip Stocks with Strong Forecast\n\nThe entire chip sector got a boost Thursday, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) rising more than 3%. Some of the biggest winners in the SOX were other top Taiwan Semi customers, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese companies are all set to benefit from the continued explosive growth in demand for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia and AMD are already leaders in this market and other semiconductor companies are ramping up their AI chip production as well. Taiwan Semi gave a clear indication Thursday that AI demand is booming and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nTaiwan Semi CEO C.C. Wei said during the earnings call that even though last year was a “challenging” one for the chip industry, “we also witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications with TSMC as a key enabler.” Wei added that AI chip demand is “robust” and that “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC.”\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSure, it may be tough for top chip stocks to do even better than they did in 2023. The SOX was up about 60% last year while Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom all topped that. But as the AI revolution marches on, the unbridled optimism from TSMC’s Wei about AI can’t be ignored.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s more, the fact that Samsung just launched an AI-enabled version of its Galaxy smartphone likely means that an AI iPhone isn’t likely to be too far behind. As long as Taiwan Semi keeps pumping out AI chips for Apple and semiconductor giants Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm, then TSM and these six other big tech stocks will likely all continue to ride the momentum of the AI wave.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

        "content": "After a strong 2023, the semiconductor sector lost its momentum at the start of 2024 on easing bets for Fed rate cuts in March. This is because the bouts of economic data came in hotter than expected, dialing back expectations of early rate cuts, thereby leading to losses in the sector. However, the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth within the sector.\r\n\r\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH is modestly up 0.5%, while iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ plunged 2%, 3.2% and 1.7%, respectively, in the initial weeks of this year. The weak trend might reverse in the weeks ahead as the Q4 earnings season unfolds (read: Can Semiconductor ETFs Continue to Shine in 2024?).\r\n\r\nSome well-known players in the space, such as Texas Instruments TXN, Lam Research LRCX, Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and NVIDIA NVDA, will report earnings in the coming weeks.

        "content": "Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia. Photo: Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters (©Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters)\n\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 gains (^GSPC) last year but can they repeat those extraordinary returns in 2024?\n\nThis group of mega-cap tech giants – Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) – are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing.\n\nIn 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500.\n\nHere’s what to expect as Tesla kicks off the mega-caps’ reporting season on 24 January.\n\nTesla (TSLA) – reporting on 24 January\n\nShares in Elon Musk’s EV maker doubled in value over 2023, gaining 102%, as the company is expected to report revenues of $25.5bn (£20.1bn).\n\nTesla has reported 485,000 deliveries for Q4 2023, marking an increase of about 20% versus the last year.\n\n“Tesla has already given insight into its performance via the quarterly vehicle production and delivery data released ahead of the financial results. In the fourth quarter it produced 494,989 vehicles and delivered 484,507 vehicles, the bulk of which were Model 3 or Y,” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\n“It managed to hit a 1.8 million annual delivery target which effectively gave it breathing space amid market worries that competition was biting at its heels, particularly China’s BYD which surpassed Tesla as the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles last quarter,” he added.\n\nThere are concerns around a stall in its automotive sales with no new model launch and delayed Cybertruck ramp-up.\n\nAnalyst forecast for the next set of quarterly results is $0.72 earnings per share.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) – reporting on 30 January\n\nMicrosoft managed to steal the title of most valuable company in the world from Apple in 2024, with the software giant’s bet on AI paying off.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella has made a push for Microsoft to assume a global leadership role in AI. The company has a significant stake in leading AI startup ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, and reportedly invested up to $13bn in the startup.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis alliance has been considered one of the tech industry’s most lucrative tie-ups.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft’s market capitalisation stood at $2.895tn, a new record high for the company, and above Apple’s market cap of $2.825tn.\n\nThe last time the software giant earned the title of most valuable company in the world was back in 2021.\n\nThe consensus analyst forecast for the next set of quarterly results is earnings per share at $2.29 and revenue at $52.94bn.\n\nRead more: FTSE top trending tickers of 2023\n\n“The big issues are whether Microsoft can sustain robust growth in cloud computing and how it can take AI to the next level,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Seen by most as the dominant AI software play, its apps are already critical to millions of businesses, so wrapping functionality into Windows, Microsoft 365, Azure and more through its Copilot tools offers immense potential.\n\n“It is not all champagne and caviar for Microsoft. Its success has naturally attracted the attention of various regulators and competition authorities and like its mega cap peers, there are growing concerns that the company has become too dominant. Antitrust probes are likely to be a key focus for investors in 2024.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) – reporting on 30 January\n\nThe search engine giant appears to be playing catch-up in the AI race and announced hundreds of job cuts in an effort to reduce costs. But the stock is still a buy with most analysts given its powerful free cash flow.\n\nMost analysts are expecting Alphabet to report a 12% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, to $85.26bn, which should translate to a 51% increase in per-share earnings to $1.60, up from $1.05 in the same year-ago period.\n\n“Alphabet has beaten market expectations for both earnings per share and revenue over the past three consecutive quarterly results. Investors will be hoping it can make it four in a row on 30 January,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Cloud computing is the big unknown – one minute Alphabet is thriving in this area, the next it cannot sustain growth momentum. Competition is fierce and this is a difficult one to call ahead of the results.\n\n“YouTube continues to go from strength to strength, with millions of people now treating the platform as a priority place to consume content.\n\nApple (AAPL) – reporting on 30 January\n\nApple has taken overtaken Samsung (005930.KS)as the world’s biggest phone maker but that might not be enough to convince investors amid dwindling iPhone sales in China.\n\nApple added $1tn in market cap in 2023 even as it has reported revenue declines from the prior year in four consecutive quarters.\n\nAnalysts forecast Apple to report $2.09 earnings per share and $118bn revenue amid weakness in China and global waning demand for Mac computers and iPads.\n\n“The company used to have a reputation for bringing out truly innovative products and shaking up the marketplace. In recent years that reputation has soured as there have only been new iterations of the same products,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“The momentous change could be the Vision Pro headset which goes on sale in February 2024. While the $3,500 price point looks high, people pay that for high-end laptops and this could feasibly be another ‘must-have’ product for Apple fans.\n\n“The key issue to monitor is whether Apple’s output can meet demand as last year there were reports it had to drastically cut production forecasts for the Vision Pro due to the complexity of its design.”\n\nMeta Platforms (META) – reporting on 1 February\n\nIts year of efficiency, that saw the company pivot away from the metaverse push, allowed Meta to achieve a remarkable return of 194% in 2023.\n\nHowever, what can investors expect when Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook owner, sold almost half a billion dollars’ worth of the company’s shares at the end of last year. It was the first time he sold shares in almost two years.\n\nAnalysts forecast $4.96 earnings per share in Meta’s fourth quarter for 2023 versus a $1.76 per share loss in the same period a year earlier. Revenue is estimated be $39bn versus $34.15bn one quarter earlier.\n\n“The results are likely to include a reiteration that expenses are going to rise in 2024, driven by higher infrastructure-related costs and investment in AI. The hype around the metaverse has died down but it continues to plug away at the concept and any success from Apple’s Vision Pro headset could revive public interest in virtual worlds,” Coatsworth said.\n\nRead more: ChatGPT portfolio outperforms the UK’s top 10 most popular funds\n\n“Meta has a big folder of AI ideas such as language translation and Instagram users reimagining their photos, but these seem unlikely to generate meaningful revenue, so advertising will remain key in terms of income for the near future,” he added.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – reporting on 21 February\n\nAmazon saw its stock surge 81% in 2023 and is betting that generative AI will produce tens of billions in revenue for Amazon Web Services in the next few years.\n\nAmazon aims to be a dominant player in the market despite being slow to invest in this technology.\n\nThe company also has a strong position in TV, film and music streaming and although the stock is not inexpensive, shares are the cheapest they have been in over 10 years.\n\nAmazon has guided for net sales between $160bn and $167bn, equating to 7% to 12% growth versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The analyst consensus forecast is $0.78 earnings per share and $165.86bn revenue.\n\n“The uncertain economic outlook raises the prospect that companies are continuing to find new ways to save money including paring back IT costs which could be problematic for Amazon’s cloud computing division. Potentially offsetting this issue is greater corporate interest in AI which could benefit the group,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Amazon has been rolling out new versions of AI chips which it said offer enhanced performance and announced plans to invest up to $4bn in Anthropic, a US company generating AI systems and large language models. AI may be the ‘hot theme’ in tech but keeping up with rivals, let alone overtaking them, can be a costly exercise,” he added.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – reporting on 21 February\n\nThe AI boom of these tech mega-caps would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year.\n\nWith demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year.\n\nThe analyst consensus forecast for its next quarterly results is $4.49 earnings per share and $20.06bn revenue.\n\nRead more: How AI boom will benefit these nine chipmakers in 2024\n\n“Nvidia is going all-in on AI, believing the world is on the cusp of a radical shift in technology usage. Companies in every industry are exploring ways to deploy AI to improve productivity and that creates a huge runway for Nvidia to grow its earnings,” Coatsworth said.\n\n“Its key challenge is to keep up with demand and to keep innovating, rolling out new products that can help companies while also ensuring it remains at the forefront of the AI industry. Nvidia is the dominant force in market and there is no room for complacency, otherwise competition will be biting at its heels,” he added.\n\nWatch: Why tech will still be 'one of the leaders' in 2024<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/magnificent-seven-continue-dominating-markets-210500660.html\\\">nonstop talks of the Magnificent Seven and AI</a>.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.\n\nShare buyback activity is making a strong comeback after remaining muted immediately after the pandemic. In December 2023, a Wall Street Journal report cited data from VerityData which said that accelerated share repurchases (ASRs) were on track to post their second-best quarter since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike normal stock buybacks, which give companies an extended period of time to buy back shares and maneuver around any market changes and uncertainty, ASRs require contracts with investment banks which require companies to sell their stock upfront at a set price.\n\nStock buybacks remain one of the most commonly deployed ways by companies to return rewards to shareholders. Data shows that between 2012 and 2021, public companies distributed $11 trillion to shareholders mostly via stock buybacks.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we used a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices which compiled data on share buyback activity in 2022 and 2023. From this detailed report we picked 11 companies with the highest amount of share buybacks in terms of dollar value in the 12-month period ending September 2023. For these companies we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator 11 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks\n\n11. Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$10.23B\n\nBooking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) is one of the stocks with the biggest buybacks in the 12-month period ending September 2023. Booking Holdings Inc's (NASDAQ:BKNG) share buybacks in this period are worth about $10.23 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, Wedbush Securities called Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) its top travel pick for 2024. Wedbush's analyst Scott Devitt set a $3,850 price target on the stock with an Outperform rating. The analyst praised Booking Holdings Inc's (NASDAQ:BKNG) margins which he believes are driven by solid marketing and management. Wedbush said it expects long-term margins for Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) to trend toward +35% with excess cash allocated to buybacks.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG).\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Also in the consumer discretionary sector, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) shares rose as travel and leisure companies continued to fare well, with a strong summer season of travel driving positive sentiment. Booking maintains a strong competitive moat, in terms of direct traffic share and marketing efficiency, and its strength in alternative accommodations. These are growing faster than hotels and reached 34% of lodging room nights during the third quarter, which was notable as Booking has yet to reach full feature parity versus rival Airbnb (ABNB) — suggesting there is some room to grow there.”\n\n10. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$10.4B\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks with the biggest buybacks over the past 12 months through September 2023.\n\nIn August 2023 NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) said it would buy back a whopping $25 billion of its shares. The move surprised many since the stock had already tripled in 2023 through the time of this buyback announcement.\n\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya said in a note earlier this month that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) could generate about $100 billion in incremental free cash flow over the next two years. The analyst has a $700 price target and a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 180 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) was Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners which owns a $6.1 billion stake.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\n\n“Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those three stocks, as well as Microsoft, were among the leading contributors to Strategy performance for the quarter. Microsoft and Nvidia continued to be supported by strong execution and leadership positions in the implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThese are high-quality, cash flow generative businesses that we will continue to own, actively adjusting our positioning sizes based on risk/reward and portfolio construction priorities. With Nvidia shares more than tripling in 2023, we opportunistically took profits throughout the year, an approach that continued in the fourth quarter with additional trims that brought the position down to 6% of overall assets.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.”\n\n9. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$11.3B\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) carried out $11.3 billion worth of share buybacks in the 12-month period through September 2023, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) management talked about dividends, share buybacks and other important business updates during Comcast Corporation's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) third quarter earnings call in October 2023:\n\nSince the end of 2018, we have refinanced over $40 billion or nearly 40% of our debt obligations, reduced net debt from $108 billion to $88 billion today, lowered net leverage by a full turn from 3.3 times to 2.3 times, increased the average life of our debt by more than four years to 17 years, while reducing the weighted average cost of our debt to 3.6% from 3.8%. Today, 97% of our debt is at fixed rates compared to just 82% at the end of 2018. We accomplished this while at the same time returning $45 billion to shareholders, including $24 billion via share repurchases and $21 billion in dividends. To sum up, we’re in a great place, especially given how the competitive dynamics in our industry might evolve in this higher-for-longer interest rate environment.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Long-term holdings Charter and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) delivered strong second-quarter results relative to expectations; their stable recurring revenue streams and undemanding valuations were rewarded in the current environment. Cable multiples compressed over the past 24 months on fears of heightened competition in their core broadband business from fixed wireless and fiber providers. While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon. We think both cable companies are well-positioned to continue to grow while generating substantial free cash flows. We added to Comcast during the quarter.”\n\n8. Visa Inc (NYSE:V)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$12.2B\n\nVisa Inc (NYSE:V) ranks 8th in our list of the stocks with the biggest buybacks. Data from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that Visa Inc (NYSE:V) had $12.2 billion in share buybacks in the one-year period through September 2023. In October, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) announced a whopping $25 billion stock buyback plan and upped its dividend by 16%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 167 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nIn its October 2023 investor letter, Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):\n\n“Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported a strong result with net revenue increasing 11% year-on-year to $8.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 21% to $2.33. As has been the case for many years now, the scalable nature of the business allows for revenue growth to outpace its costs, which places the company in a good position to navigate through this inflationary period. The network continues to grow, with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17%, respectively. Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances. Altogether, we’re pleased with how the business is tracking and remain positive on Visa’s outlook.”\n\n7. T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$13.6B\n\nT-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) has been announcing and conducting frequent stock buybacks. In September 2023, T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) announced a new shareholder cash return program worth about $19 billion. T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) also announced it intends to pay dividends of about $3.75 billion on a quarterly basis from October 1, 2023, to December 31, 2024.\n\nCiti analyst Michael Rollins recently said T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) remains his \"top-ranked buy.\" The analyst said he continues to like opportunities for \"T-Mobile to grow service revenue faster than the category, expand margins, and return capital to shareholders at an elevated pace.\" Rollins has a $176 price target on the stock.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 79 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) during this period was Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway which owns a $734 million stake in T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS).\n\nClearBridge Dividend Strategy made the following comment about T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter we initiated positions in two new names: T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Gilead Sciences. T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.\n\nThis combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.\n\nGiven the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.\n\nWe have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend. The company announced its inaugural dividend in September, and we bought the stock shortly thereafter. The initial yield is about 2% and it is expected to grow about 10% per year.”\n\n6. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nStock Buybacks in 12 Months Through September 2023:$14.7B\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is one of the prominent stocks with the biggest buybacks. Over the past 12 months Chevron Corporation's (NYSE:CVX) share buybacks are worth $14.7 billion through September 2023. In January 2023, the oil giant announced an eye-popping $75 billion stock buyback program, which Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) later said will start from April 1, 2023, and does not have a fixed expiration date. Chevron Corporation's (NYSE:CVX) previous buyback program worth $25 billion started in January 2019 and ended March 31, 2023.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 72 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX). The most significant stakeholder of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) during this period was Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway which owns an $18.6 billion stake in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).\n\nAriel Focus Fund made the following comment about Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Also in the quarter, we initiated a position in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), the second largest integrated energy company in the U.S., operating in exploration, production and refining on a global scale. We view the company as competitively advantaged with a strong balance sheet, sustainable growth pathway and an effective management team. Going forward CVX expects improved cost efficiencies and production growth via its differentiated position in the Permian Basin and recent acquisition of Noble Energy. Additionally, management believes a combination of its new higher-margin projects along with operational improvements will drive a double-digit return of capital employed by 2027. Although oil and gas prices, which lay outside of the company’s control, ultimately dictate Chevron’s earnings and cashflow profile, the organization is laser focused on capital discipline. It is this lack of predictability, and potential fear of a global recession which presented us with an opportunity to initiate a position in this high barrier to entry producer at reasonable prices.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks with the Biggest Buybacks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable 16 Most Profitable Small-Cap Stocks Now 30 Most Profitable Businesses You Can Start in USA\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "7 Top-Rated Blue-Chip Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are Loving Now: January 2024",
        "content": "Analysts continue to sing the praises of many companies and their stocks. While 2024 has gotten off to a problematic start, many stocks are still attractively valued and well-run and have catalysts that are likely to push their share prices higher in the coming months. Given the rocky start to the year, stocks of blue-chip companies seem particularly popular with analysts right now. These are established companies that are profitable and have stable and predictable earnings. Blue-chip stocks are often popular during periods of market volatility and uncertainty, such as we’re experiencing now. With Treasury yields rising, tensions escalating in the Middle East, and the timing of interest rate cuts uncertain now would be a good time to shift some capital into stable blue-chip names. Here are seven top-rated blue-chip stocks Wall Street analysts are loving now: January 2024.\n\nTop-Rated Blue-Chip Stocks: Goldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) looks to be back in the good graces of analysts after its strong fourth-quarter financial results. The Wall Street powerhouse reported Q4 numbers that beat forecasts due to a big boost in its wealth management unit. Goldman announced earnings per share (EPS) of $5.48, which was better than the $3.62 consensus forecast. Revenue in the October through December quarter totaled $11.32 billion versus $10.80 billion that had been expected.\n\nGoldman Sachs’ latest profit was up an impressive 51% from a year earlier. The Q4 print is a comeback for the company, which has struggled over the last 18 months following a failed push into consumer banking. The firm continues to get most of its revenue from deals such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and initial public offerings (IPOs). However, investment banking fees declined 12% from a year earlier in Q4 amid a continued lack of deals on Wall Street. Fortunately, that decline was offset by a 26% rise in equity trading and a 23% increase in wealth management during Q4. GS stock is up nearly 10% in the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue sky\n\nSource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts continue to raise their ratings and price targets on Home Depot’s (NYSE:HD) stock. Analysts at Piper Sandlerare the latest to take their rating on HD stock to “buy” from “hold” previously amid an expected upturn in home improvement spending this year. Days before Piper Sandler’s upgrade, analysts at Wedbush lifted their rating on the stock to “outperform” from “neutral” and increased their price target to $380 a share from $330 previously.\n\nAnalysts have been tripping over themselves to upgrade HD stock ever since the retailer posted strong financial results for last year’s third quarter. Analysts also anticipate a turnaround in home improvement spending this year as interest rates decline and mortgage rates improve. Many analysts also expect Home Depot to benefit from a continued surge in spending by professional contractors and building companies. Since bottoming at the end of October, HD stock has gained 30%.\n\nTop-Rated Blue-Chip Stocks: AutoZone (AZO) An AutoZone (AZO) storefront in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhitney Tilson of Stansberry Research is out with a bullish note on AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), the aftermarket automotive parts and accessories retailer whose stock has been a long-term outperformer. Tilson points out that AutoZone has trounced the broader market over the last 20 years through a combination of growth and share repurchases. Since it began its stock buyback program in 1999, AutoZone has repurchased 88% of its own stock, more than just about any other publicly traded company.\n\nAt the same time, AutoZone has grown very fast, with revenue rising more than 400% and operating income up more than 800% over the last 25 years. The combination of growth and stock buybacks has pushed AZO stock up about 10,500% since the Millennium, including tripling in the last five years. Yet despite the massive gains, AutoZone’s stock does not look richly valued right now, trading at 19 times future earnings estimates.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nEach day seems to bring with it a new analyst upgrade to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock. Wells Fargo is the latest Wall Street firm to throw some love on Microsoft’s way, raising its price target on MSFT stock to $435 per share from $425 and maintaining its “buy” rating. Wells Fargo says Microsoft has many more artificial intelligence (AI) products in its pipeline that it can monetize over the coming year.\n\nThe Wells Fargo upgrade comes on the same day that Microsoft announced a new strategic partnership related to AI with British telecommunications company Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). Microsoft has signed a 10-year deal that will see Vodafone invest $1.5 billion in customer-focused AI that it develops using Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI and Copilot technologies. In turn, Microsoft will become an equity investor in Vodafone’s Internet of Things (IoT) platform when it is spun out as a separate business in April this year.\n\nMSFT stock has increased 62% in the last 12 months.\n\nTop-Rated Blue-Chip Stocks: Lululemon (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nAnalysts at Stifel Financial have raised their price target on shares of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) to $596 a share from $529 previously and maintained a “buy” rating on the stock. The new price target from Stifel represents a 27% upside from where LULU stock is currently trading. The firm argues that Lululemon should benefit in the year ahead from margin expansion and “brand specific (earnings) drivers.”\n\nStifel is one of several analysts to raise their rating on LULU stock after the company delivered strong financial results and raised its fourth-quarter sales and profit forecasts following stronger-than-expected sales during the December holidays. In an early January news release, Lululemon said it now expects Q4 revenue of $3.170 billion to $3.190 billion and a profit of $4.96 to $5 for Q4 2023. Both numbers are above the company’s previous forecast.\n\nLULU stock has risen 45% over the last 12 months.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of Stifel, analysts at the firm, also like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), recently raised their price target on the stock to $170 from $145 and reiterated a “buy” rating on the shares. Stifel likes that the semiconductor company has a strong balance sheet and ties to secular growth trends related to AI. Stifel’s bullish call on AMD stock at the end of 2023 looks to be accurate. So far, in 2024, the company’s share price has risen 13%, including a 7% gain on Jan. 16.\n\nThe breakout in AMD stock is credited to rising optimism related to AI and other analyst upgrades of the shares. There’s also a lot of hype surrounding a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040” that AMD unveiled right before Christmas and that the company expects to boost AI applications by up to 60%. AMD has also launched its new MI300X accelerator chip for data centers and servers that competes directly with rival Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) data center chips.\n\nAMD’s stock is up 120% over the last 12 months.\n\nTop-Rated Blue-Chip Stocks: Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother chip stock that analysts have been upgrading in recent weeks is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Earlier in January, Bernstein lifted its price target on AVGO stock to $1,250 per share from $1,150 and kept a “buy” equivalent rating on the shares. Bernstein and others were impressed with Broadcom’s most recent earnings print, delivered in December. The microchip and semiconductor company posted results that beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nBroadcom reported EPS of $11.06 for what was its fiscal fourth quarter, topping the consensus expectation of $10.96. Revenue in the period came in at $9.3 billion, matching analyst expectations. The company’s microchips and semiconductors are used in networking, broadband, server storage, and wireless products, all of which are in high demand. Management has also said they are seeing an increase in the demand for generative AI.\n\nAVGO stock has gained 93% over the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and NVDA.

        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide NVIDIA with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's Improving Profits\n\nIn business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It is awe-striking that NVIDIA's EPS went from US$2.39 to US$7.65 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of NVIDIA shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 26% to 46% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\n\nStory continues earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for NVIDIA.\n\nAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$1.4t company like NVIDIA. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$55b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\n\nDoes NVIDIA Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nNVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "In 2024, the playbook for growth investors is likely to look similar to 2023. Tech stocks are expected to lead the way, and the interest in artificial intelligence (AI) is not expected to decline much.\n\nHowever, while you can buy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and call it a day, it comes with a lofty valuation. That will make it hard for NVDA stock to repeat its performance in 2024. A different option for growth-oriented investors is to look for tech stocks with an AI story that are flying under the radar. This means looking at small- and mid-cap stocks that are primed for growth, especially if interest rates come down.\n\nOne way you can look for undervalued tech stocks is with a stock screener. In this case, I was looking for stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the technology sector. Sometimes stocks have a low P/E ratio for a reason, and these are still speculative tech stocks. But they each look to have strong upside in 2024 that speculative investors can get behind.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCerence (CRNC) Purple and blue graphic of brain over top of data center, smartphone, laptop and various other tech, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Nadya C\n\nCerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) uses conversational and generative AI to develop intelligent AI assistant solutions to enhance the automotive and mobility user experience. According to the latest information from Cerence, 54% of global auto production uses the company’s technology. This also leads to 78% of the company’s revenue being of the recurring variety.\n\nIn the last 12 months, the Cerence stock is down more than 15%, as revenue and earnings have been lower year-over-year. However, this is a profitable company and its forward P/E ratio of around 28x is more attractive than some of the higher valuations that tech stocks are known for.\n\nCRNC stock has a consensus price target of $21.75, which is over 17% higher than its current price. Of the nine analysts who have given the stock a rating, four give it a “Strong Buy.” Plus, 92% of CRNC stock is owned by institutional investors. Some speculative investors may see that as a negative, but it does suggest that the smart money believes in the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nSensata Technologies (ST) electric vehicles at a recharging station\n\nSource: Sopotnicki / Shutterstock.com\n\nSensata Technologies (NYSE:ST) is best-known for its position in the EV market. There’s a good reason for that. The company has sensors that control over a dozen key automotive systems. However, the company serves a variety of additional markets. Recently, the company launched Sensata INSIGHTS, which uses AI to help convert Internet of Things (IoT) data to usable insight for its customers.\n\nSensata stock has a forward P/E of around 9.4x. It also has a consensus price target of $42.17 which is a 24.56% upside.\n\nHowever, strictly from a technical standpoint, you may want to let the stock drift a little lower before taking a position. ST stock is down nearly 25% in the last 12 months and nearly 6% in the last month. It’s also dropped below both short- and longer-term moving averages. That being said, the relative strength indicator is in the mid-30’s, which suggests the stock may be reaching an oversold condition. If you’re a trader, Sensata is one to watch closely.\n\nDigi International (DGII) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web. tech stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike the other tech stocks on this list, Digi International (NASDAQ:DGII) is a significant player in the IoT arena. By 2030, analysts are forecasting that there will be approximately 30 billion IoT devices on the market. This is everything from EVs to traffic signals, and there will be applications we’re not even considering.\n\nDigi International builds and distributes products such embedded network connections and scalable USB and cell communication modules that will be critical to that buildout. This is a small-cap company that is already profitable and is consistently growing revenue and earnings.\n\nDespite that, DGII stock is down 39% in the last 12 months. As 2023 was a rough year for small-caps, that’s not completely surprising. However, in the next 12 months, the company is projecting earnings growth of more than 10%. Analysts agree and give DGII a “Strong Buy” rating with a consensus price target of $7.80 which is a 65.79% upside from its current level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment, processors (CPUs) and graphics chips serve as their brains. The growth of data and technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, and smart cars are creating the next wave of secular growth for the industry.\n\nThe 41 semiconductors stocks we track reported a slower Q3; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 0.8% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 4.1% below consensus.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) logged a smaller-than-expected decline in its fourth-quarter profit as revenue was buoyed by increased sales of its most advanced chips.\n\nThe world’s largest contract chipmaker forecast slightly weaker performance in the first quarter of 2024, but said that chip demand in the coming year will be supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by... robust AI-related demand. AI models need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware... thus the value of TSMC's technology position is increasing,\" CEO C.C. Wei said in a post-earnings call.\n\nProfit for the three months to December 31 fell to T$238.7 billion ($7.6 billion) from T$295.9 billion a year ago. On a per-share basis, profit fell to T$9.21, but still beat Investing.com estimates of T$8.67.\n\nRevenue was T$625.5 billion ($20 billion), remaining largely unchanged from the prior year, but beating estimates for a reading of T$617.24 billion. The figure was also above TSMC’s forecast for the year.\n\nRevenue improved from the prior quarter on improved demand for its 3 nanometer chips, which TSMC describes as the industry’s most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nTSMC said it expects sales in the first quarter to range between $18 billion and $18.8 billion, with a gross margin of 52% to 54%. Its gross margin for the fourth quarter was 53%.\n\nThe firm also forecast slightly higher capital expenditure for 2024, between $28 billion to $32 billion, compared to about $30.1 billion in 2023. A bulk of this expenditure will be dedicated towards high-computing chips, CEO Wei said.\n\nDemand for high-performance computing chips improved in the fourth quarter, likely boosted by increasing interest in artificial intelligence development. The launch of OpenAI’s Chat GPT bot in late-2022 had triggered a widespread rush into the development and application of similar AI products.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI development uses a large amount of computing power, which in turn requires more advanced, higher-power silicone. This also spells higher demand for TSMC.\n\nAnalysts had expected an improvement in TSMCs earnings amid dwindling inventory levels among PC and smartphone manufacturers. This also helped shore up chip demand from a lull caused by weak electronics demand, easing technology investment and high interest rates.\n\nTSMC is a key supplier to tech majors Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the latter of which has benefited greatly from increased demand for AI chips. Nvidia had recently unveiled a new line of chips dedicated solely towards AI development.\n\nTSMC’s earnings have now beaten estimates for all four quarters of 2023, which, coupled with the prospect of improving chip demand, saw the firm’s Taiwan stock rally over 30% in the past year.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "title": "3 Top-Rated Semiconductor Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are Loving Now: January 2024",
        "content": "Semiconductors provide functionality and life to the digital age. Everything from our smartphones, tablets, PCs and even cars are, in some way or another, powered by these tiny silicon-based devices. While providing functionality to a multiplicity of electronic devices in the modern era, semiconductors are also critical to supercharging technological revolutions, including breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and quantum computing.\n\nInvestors betting on semiconductor stocks can be tantamount to betting on the future of technology. With all that said, below are three top-rated semiconductor stocks that Wall Street analysts are loving these days.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of the best-performing stocks of 2023, with a staggering gain of more than 240% last year. The chip stock is already off to a great start in 2024, so much so that it could be another record year for Nvidia’s share price. Shares, thus far, have risen to an all-time high of $563.82/share. The chipmaker has been riding high on the booming demand for its AI solutions, which power some of the most advanced and popular applications in the world, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to Koyfin, out of 51 Wall Street analysts surveyed, the overwhelming majority of them have given Nvidia a Buy rating. The chipmaker’s average price target is also $662.72/share, which implies a nearly 18% potential increase from the current share price. Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip market as well as its leadership in providing chips that power data centers are tailwinds that could continue guiding the company’s shares upward.\n\nMicron Technology (MU)\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is best known for designing and selling memory products, including NAND flash memory and random-access memory such as DRAM and SRAM. Ever since ChatGPT and other generative AI tools entered the market in the first half of 2023, demand for advanced memory chips has accelerated. In its Q3 and Q4 2023 earnings reports, despite sluggish memory demand for PCs and smartphones, the firm reported seeing sizable demand for chips destined to power AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat is probably why Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the stock despite a lack of strong demand for consumer hardware. Micron currently holds a Strong Buy rating from many Wall Street analysts. With price targets floating around $82/share, a 16% potential upside could be at play here for investors willing to allocate at the current share price.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last entrant on this list is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). This chipmaker also has a Strong Buy rating from a variety of Wall Street analysts, and it’s not hard to figure out why. AMD is slated to officially enter the AI chip race in 2024. Last year, AMD announced how it would tackle the AI market. In particular, in its second-quarter earnings report, the chipmaker finally announced the MI300x GPU chipset, which will compete directly with Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips used to train LLMs. The chipmaker announced it expects to sell $2 billion in AI chips next year.\n\nWhile AMD’s entrance into the AI chip market will ultimately require a lot of time and investment, Wall Street analysts are still excited to see what the chipmaker has to bring to the table. Given the way AMD unseated Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market, AMD could potentially be a capable competitor to Nvidia in the burgeoning AI chip market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 10 best long-term tech stocks to buy. To skip our analysis of the tech industry and its recent trends, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Long-Term Tech Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe tech market is undergoing a significant transformation propelled by advancements in AI, data analytics, and cybersecurity. Among these, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands out as a potentially groundbreaking technological advancement, with Wall Street analysts drawing parallels to pivotal innovations like the internet. While there is a widespread consensus that AI will ultimately reshape the economy and boost corporate profits, there is vigorous debate regarding the timing and magnitude of these transformative and lucrative changes. Skeptics argue that especially in the stock market domain, the excitement surrounding AI may have surpassed actual developments, potentially leaving some highly valued stocks exposed to a decline in the event of an economic slowdown.\n\nDespite the initial decline in the NASDAQ during the early days of the year and the skepticism expressed by some circles regarding the Magnificent Seven's ability to sustain the gains observed in 2023, long-term analysts remain optimistic, believing that technology stocks have further potential for growth in 2024. During a recent appearance on CNBC, Josh Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, discussed the factors contributing to the decline in tech stocks in the first week of 2024. Brown attributed this decline to a significant amount of profit-taking activity currently underway, driven by the remarkable returns investors witnessed in the technology sector throughout 2023, particularly in the fourth quarter. The wealth manager also expressed an understanding of the rationale behind early-year profit-taking, given the spectacular rally in 2023. With that said, he emphasized that the downturn in tech stocks should not be misconstrued as these companies \"stumbling\"; rather, it is a result of strategic profit-taking.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the technology industry is poised for expansion as a growing number of companies show interest in joining the competition for AI and data analytics. Key industry players like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the best technology stocks that are achieving notable progress in the field and could potentially take the lead in seizing the considerable opportunities arising from future advancements. Best Long-Term Tech Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by Smartworks Coworking on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWhen assembling our portfolio of the best long-term tech stocks to buy, our initial step involved identifying some of the best technology stocks showing potential for share price growth by considering analyst average share price targets with a minimum Buy rating.

(NASDAQ:MELI) shares and maintained a price target of $1500.\n\nAs of Q3 2023, Mercadolibre, Inc.

Generation Investment Management emerged as the largest hedge fund shareholder, holding 480,480 shares valued at $609.19 million.\n\n8. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 81\n\nBased in Austin, Texas, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a multinational American company specializing in automotive and clean energy. The company is widely recognized for its expertise in designing and manufacturing electric vehicles, as well as providing stationary battery energy storage solutions for various scales, from households to grid-level applications.

Catherine D. Wood's ARK Investment Management emerged as a prominent shareholder for the quarter, holding a stake valued at $1.02 billion.\n\n7. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing firm that specializes in producing chips for major entities such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In November, the company delivered positive news to investors by reporting its first monthly increase in sales since February, driven by heightened demand for smartphones and AI.\n\nOn November 13, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) revealed a significant 34.8% month-over-month surge in its October net revenue, reaching nearly NT$243.2 billion, accompanied by a year-over-year growth of 15.7%, marking it as one of the best technology stocks to consider.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, 107 hedge funds held positions in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Fisher Asset Management emerged as the primary investor in the company, increasing its holdings to 30.637 million shares, valued at $2.66 billion.\n\nIn its third quarter 2023 investor letter, Bonsai Partners stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM):\n\n“Robustness at the product level exists differently than in other layers of the value chain. Product diversification follows the same principle, but product control isn’t related to vertical integration. Product control exists in multiple forms, such as switching costs or happy customers who don’t want to buy elsewhere. However, one often overlooked dimension of product-level robustness is adaptability. Some businesses offer goods and services that behave like shapeshifters; they naturally adapt to the market’s needs regardless of how the world changes. Adaptability also serves as a hedge against the unknown.\n\nConsider our investment in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), which enjoys a highly adaptive product portfolio. If we compare TSMC to a fabless chip maker like Qualcomm, investing in Qualcomm is a bet that its products will retain their technological advantage over time. Meanwhile, TSMC sells a service that naturally produces whatever the end customer wants. There is little need for brilliant product-level foresight; TSMC just needs to maintain its process and service level advantages, allowing it to manufacture whatever the market demands. TSMC’s product portfolio is robust compared to most other semiconductor companies because it naturally adapts to technological and market-driven shifts. Instead of product-level risk, TSMC’s core risks are geopolitical.”\n\n6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), commonly known as AMD, is a global semiconductor company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Specializing in the development of computer processors and associated technologies, AMD serves both business and consumer markets.\n\nOn October 10, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) announced the finalization of a definitive agreement to acquire Nod.ai, a strategic move aimed at enhancing the company's capabilities in open AI software. In August of the same year, AMD had also acquired Mipsology, an AI software company known for its expertise in providing AI solutions compatible with AMD adaptive computing silicon.\n\nOn November 13, investment advisory firm Roth MKM initiated coverage of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with a Buy rating and a price target of $125. The focus was on the company's distinctive portfolio of high-performance compute and networking processors.\n\nAs of Q3 2023, 110 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), valued at $9.2 billion. Fisher Asset Management, led by Ken Fisher, emerged as the largest hedge fund shareholder, owning 27.8 million shares with a total value of $2.9 billion.\n\nIn addition to Apple, Inc.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nOn January 17, financial markets experienced a significant downturn, marking the worst day in a month for stocks, primarily driven by a surge in bond yields. Accrdoing to Bloomberg, this development has raised speculations that the Federal Reserve may not be quick to implement interest rate cuts, given the apparent resilience of the economy. The likelihood of a March interest-rate cut, as indicated by Fed swaps, has now been trimmed to approximately 50%, reflecting a shift in market expectations. The surge in US retail sales, reported as the highest in three months, further intensified concerns among investors. The robust reading on retail sales triggered apprehensions about the efficacy of Wall Street's assertive dovish stance, especially in the context of favorable economic data. Central bank officials, adopting a more cautious tone regarding potential easing measures, added to the apprehension among traders. This cautious stance has created an environment where market participants are now readjusting their expectations, delaying the anticipated timing of the first Fed move. As a result, the odds of a rate reduction in the first quarter have been revised downward. The comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde underscore the concerns about aggressive market bets on interest-rate cuts. Lagarde emphasized that such speculative behavior in financial markets may not be conducive to policymakers' efforts and their ability to effectively manage economic challenges.\n\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has commanded considerable attention at the World Economic Forum, drawing interest from major tech players like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google. In 2024, the spotlight has shifted to a more nuanced exploration of generative AI, with a specific emphasis on advancing the accuracy of AI results. This evolution is deemed critical for fostering confidence, particularly in high-stakes industries such as healthcare and manufacturing. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has emerged as a key advocate for this refinement, asserting that the next phase of AI development involves incorporating formal correctness into the underlying models. In an interview with CNBC, Gelsinger underscores the need for precision, especially in domains like medicine, manufacturing, and autonomous driving, where accuracy is paramount. Interviews with Gelsinger and Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, reveal a shared commitment to experimentation and co-piloting tests as instrumental strategies for improving accuracy and encouraging wider adoption of AI technologies. Shih introduces a pragmatic three-phase approach for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) adoption, which begins with assisting work, progresses to ensuring accuracy in autopilot mode, and ultimately leads to trusting the technology at chosen confidence levels. This phased approach aligns with the broader goal of making AGI more approachable and less intimidating, emphasizing the crucial role of human acceptance. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, contributes insights during panel discussions, characterizing AGI as a potent tool rather than a disruptive force replacing jobs. Altman underscores the collaborative potential of AI, describing it as an enhancer of productivity that amplifies human capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq, reflects on the past year as a transformative period for AI, describing it as a time of discovery. The financial industry, including Nasdaq, is gearing up for an \"activation\" phase, leveraging AI to update outdated code and modernize aging systems. The anticipated outcome is significant improvements in automated workflows, leading to substantial time savings for employees. The discussions at Davos underscore the pivotal role of generative AI in shaping the technological landscape. The current focus on accuracy, trust-building, and practical applications across diverse industries signals a transformative shift, emphasizing the collaborative potential of AI as a tool for enhancing productivity and human capabilities.\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets. Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\n10. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nAs of January 16, Barclays analyst Ryan Macwilliams has opted to uphold his Equal-Weight rating on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), while concurrently revising the price target upward from $32 to $44. This adjustment in the price target indicates an optimistic outlook for the stock's performance in the foreseeable future. It is important to note that the industry context for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is crucial in understanding these recommendations. In the dynamic landscape of the technology sector, Intel, as a prominent player in the semiconductor industry, is subject to various market forces and trends. The Equal-Weight rating implies that the analyst perceives Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) performance to be in line with the broader market, neither overweight nor underweight. This nuanced stance suggests a balanced perspective, taking into consideration both the company's strengths and potential challenges. The decision to raise the price target to $44 signifies increased confidence in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) ability to deliver positive returns to investors.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\n09. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)\n\nUpside Potential: 2%\n\nAs of January 16, Barclays has adjusted its outlook on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), a key player in the consumer goods industry. Specifically, Barclays has raised the company's price target from $75 to $82, reflecting a moderate upside potential of 2% in comparison to its current market price. Despite this upward revision, Barclays maintains an Equal Weight rating on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) shares. This strategic move by Barclays suggests a cautious yet optimistic stance on the company's performance. The Equal Weight rating implies that, according to Barclays analysts, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is expected to perform in line with industry peers, neither overweight nor underweight. Investors may interpret this rating as an indication of balanced expectations for the stock's future performance. The increase in the price target to $82 underscores Barclays' confidence in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) ability to generate positive returns for investors. The 2% upside potential suggests a measured optimism, taking into account various factors such as market conditions, company fundamentals, and potential catalysts within the consumer goods sector.\n\nSimilar to the optimistic sentiments expressed by analysts towards Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), they are favorable about Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL).\n\n08. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nUpside Potential: 10%\n\nAs of January 16, Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman has made notable adjustments to the outlook for The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), a prominent player in the beverage industry. Specifically, Lieberman has increased the company's price target by 10%, elevating it from $60 to $66. Importantly, this modification reflects a substantial upside potential of 10% in comparison to its current market price. Concurrently, Barclays has maintained an Overweight rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shares. The decision to raise the price target to $66 indicates a heightened level of confidence in Coca-Cola's future performance, as perceived by Barclays. This optimistic adjustment may be underpinned by factors such as anticipated improvements in financial metrics, strategic initiatives, or positive trends within the beverage industry. The Overweight rating reaffirms Barclays' belief that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is poised to outperform its industry peers. This rating suggests a favorable view of the stock's potential for delivering strong returns relative to the broader market. Investors may interpret this as a signal to consider The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) as an attractive investment opportunity within the beverage sector.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”\n\n07. Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)\n\nUpside Potential: 11%\n\nAs of January 16, Piper Sandler has revised its assessment of Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), a prominent player in the home improvement retail industry. Specifically, Piper Sandler has increased the target price for Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) from $218.00 to $245.00, signaling a substantial upside potential of 11%. This adjustment is accompanied by Piper Sandler's decision to affirm an \"overweight\" rating for the stock. The heightened target price of $245.00 reflects Piper Sandler's optimistic outlook on Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), suggesting a strong belief in the company's potential for future growth. This positive adjustment may be driven by factors such as anticipated improvements in financial performance, strategic initiatives, or favorable trends within the home improvement retail sector. The \"overweight\" rating underscores Piper Sandler's conviction that Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is well-positioned to outperform its industry peers. This rating implies a favorable view of the stock's potential to deliver robust returns compared to the broader market. Investors may interpret this rating as a signal to consider Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) as an attractive investment opportunity within the home improvement retail landscape.\n\nLowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is garnering bullish outlooks from analysts, much like the positive sentiments observed for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).\n\nMadison Investors Fund made the following comment about Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The bottom five individual contributors were Dollar Tree, Fiserv, Analog Devices, Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), and Alcon. Both Analog Devices and Lowe’s Companies saw end-market demand moderate (in semiconductors and home improvement products, respectively) relative to the strong levels over the last couple of years. Despite these near-term trends, we remain very confident in the long-term trends within both markets.”\n\n06. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nUpside Potential: 15%\n\nAs of January 16, BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham has made significant adjustments to the outlook for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), a major player in the financial services industry. Specifically, Fotheringham has increased the firm's price target from $192 to $194, signaling a noteworthy upside potential of 15%. However, it's important to note that despite the upward revision in the price target, BMO Capital has maintained a Market Perform rating on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The decision to raise the price target to $194 suggests an optimistic perspective on JPMorgan's future performance, indicating confidence in the potential for significant appreciation in its stock value. This positive adjustment may be attributed to factors such as anticipated improvements in financial metrics, strategic initiatives, or positive trends within the financial services sector. The Market Perform rating from BMO Capital implies a neutral stance on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), suggesting that the stock is expected to perform in line with the broader market. While there is acknowledgment of the potential for upside, the rating indicates a measured view on the stock's relative performance compared to its industry peers.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Vltava Fund stated the following regarding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM):\n\n“Last spring, the US went through a brief banking crisis that cost several smaller and medium-sized banks their lives. One of them, First Republic Bank, with assets of $230 billion, went into receivership and was bought out by the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). The acquisition terms were very favourable for JPM and the facts that few, if any, other banks could have taken over the whole of First Republic Bank in its then-present state while guaranteeing more than $100 billion of its deposits played a role. JPM could do it. It is not only the largest, but also by its balance sheet the strongest US bank and, in our opinion, clearly the best managed. It has come out of this crisis even stronger. We have actively followed the banking sector for 20 years in many countries around the world. Our view is that a well-managed bank can be a very good long-term investment but that it is better to focus on the best and highest quality available. Banking is not a sector where it pays to trade quality for cheaper valuations. That is why we hold JPM.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable 16 Most Profitable Small-Cap Stocks Now 30 Most Profitable Businesses You Can Start in USA\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "After huge investments, companies need to make bank on generative AI",
        "content": "If 2023 was the year companies poured money into generative AI, 2024 is the year they’re hoping those investments start to pay off. From Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Samsung and even Volkswagen and Mercedes, businesses are quickly monetizing their generative AI offerings as interest in the technology among consumers and enterprise customers remains red hot.\n\n“We expect 2024 to be a year of increased promotion and initial adoption and 2025-27 to be when the markets may take off from further applications to take advantage of the features as many key elements come together,” analysts with UBS’s Global Research and Evidence Lab wrote in an investor note on Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Samsung debuted its line of Galaxy S24 smartphones complete with the company’s Galaxy AI package of generative AI capabilities including live translation and photo editing features. On Monday, Microsoft announced that it will begin selling subscriptions for a consumer version of its Copilot AI assistant for $20 per month per user.\n\nThe tech giant also said it is opening up the enterprise version of its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to small and medium businesses. It previously only sold the service to businesses with more than 300 employees. Sam Altman, left, appears onstage with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at OpenAI's first developer conference, on Nov. 6, 2023, in San Francisco. (Barbara Ortutay/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIntel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) are selling chips with their own neural processing units for AI apps; PC makers are joining the fray by marketing their laptops and desktops as AI ready; and at CES 2024 Volkswagen said it’s bringing ChatGPT to its in-car voice assistant by the middle of the year.\n\nNow companies just need buy-in from consumers.\n\n“Is there a killer app? Is there a demonstrable application or change that will then make people pay essentially more? I think that is something [companies] will struggle with,” Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut that’s not stopping businesses from taking a chance on what could be the next great technological leap.\n\nTime to put up\n\nIf you followed the developments at CES 2024 earlier this month, you know that seemingly every tech-adjacent company on earth is using AI as a means of marketing their products.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow it’s up to the companies that are making real AI products to deliver on the promise that the technology will truly change our lives for the better.\n\nThe problem for companies, Atwal says, is that generative AI products offer consumers cumulative benefits rather than a single mind-blowing app that’s easy to sell people on.\n\n“It's a combination of elements that … will make the device easier to use. It will make you more productive. So everything becomes kind of cumulative,” he said. “Cumulative is very, very difficult to monetize.” Samsung's Intelligent Summary feature uses generative AI to, well, summarize content from the web. (Samsung) (Samsung)\n\nWhile selling the average consumer on generative AI products may prove tough, enterprise customers are already on board.\n\nAccording to Microsoft VP and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi, 77% of people in enterprises who have used the company’s Copilot business software say they would never want to give it up. Microsoft’s Copilot for Microsoft 365 currently costs $30 per user per month, the same price as Google’s own enterprise offering, Duet AI for Workspace Enterprise.\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilot Pro will test consumers’ appetite for paid generative AI services. So will the so-called AI PC, the PC industry’s marketing designation for laptops and desktops outfitted with neural processing units designed to power AI applications.\n\nSo far, chipmakers like Intel say neural processors will benefit the average consumer by running generative AI apps on their personal devices rather than in the cloud, helping to improve overall privacy and security.\n\nBut beyond that, they say we’ll have to wait to see what kind of apps developers cook up before we'll know what AI PCs are truly capable of. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to UBS’s Global Research and Evidence Lab, though, it’s just a matter of time before consumers get on board.\n\n“We think the motivations, use cases and technology enablers for [generative AI] on edge devices are aligning for initial highend adoption in 2024 and mainstream penetration from 2025-27,” UBS analysts wrote in a research document.\n\n“This has the potential to stimulate positive mix changes [spending on higher priced products] (driving requirements for more processing, storage and upgraded peripherals), and could also pull in replacement cycles as new devices offer increased usefulness, enabling content creation, productivity, and personalization.”\n\nIt’s now up to tech companies to keep customers interested in the benefits of generative AI if they hope to make anything back on their investments.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Regardless of their price volatility, cryptocurrencies always remain in the spotlight. However, the biggest developments are on the blockchain technology front and that’s where investors will find long term value creators. Shifting away from talking about cryptos, this column will focus on the best blockchain stocks to buy.\n\nLet’s come back to the blockchain technology growth potential. In 2022, the blockchain technology market size was $4.8 billion. The market size is expected to swell to $674 billion by 2030 and further to $2.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nAn important point to note is that blockchain technology is applicable across industries. The advantages include cost reduction, improved efficiency, security and innovation, among others. It’s estimated that blockchain technology can add more than $2 trillion to the global GDP by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith all these optimistic estimates, it’s a good idea to consider exposure to blockchain stocks. Let’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these names.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has witnessed a massive rally with an upside of 218% in the last 12 months. It makes sense to wait for some correction before considering fresh exposure to the stock that’s surging on the back of the potential growth from the AI market.\n\nNvidia is not directly related to blockchain technology. However, the GPU industry is booming due to blockchain development and that benefits Nvidia. As an example, the Nvidia Cmp Hx is a dedicated GPU for professional mining. This also underscores the company’s commitment to grab a pie of the swelling crypto and blockchain industry.\n\nThe blockchain industry is still at a nascent growth stage. As the industry swells in size, it’s likely that Nvidia is likely to invest in blockchain products and solutions that deliver efficiency, cost reduction and privacy to various industries.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.5 and offers a dividend yield of 3.98%. With the company increasingly investing in blockchain solutions, I am bullish on the segment for the next five to ten years.\n\nCurrently, IBM is providing blockchain solutions for industries that include banking, financial services, healthcare and government. This would imply a big addressable market. IBM has already made inroads in terms of providing solutions to specific clients. This includes the likes ofHome Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lygon.\n\nBesides this, IBM is working on critical areas like supply chain and robust traceability solutions. When the markets talk about a $2.3 trillion market for blockchain by 2032, these are the areas that will witness growth. Therefore, in the next 10-years, I would not be surprised if blockchain technology contributes significant to IBM stock value creation.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is among the most undervalued blockchain stocks to buy. At a forward P/E ratio of 34, the growth stock looks attractive. I would expect at least 100% returns from current levels in the next 24 months.\n\nSquare was re-branded as Block in 2021 and this underscores the company’s commitment towards Bitcoin and blockchain technology. In June 2022, it was reported that will be building a new platform, Web5, on the Bitcoin blockchain. The objective of the platform would be to bring decentralized identity and data storage to applications.\n\nIt was also reported in July 2023 that Block is building a “sci-fi” crypto wallet to keep Bitcoin safe. The self-custody Bitcoin wallet was launched in December 2023. These are just some developments and with an early-mover advantage, Block is positioned to make inroads in the blockchain industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market has rebounded from a weak start to the year, with the benchmark S&P 500 index rising by over 1.8% over the past five days. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index has fared better as the tech rally resumes momentum, gaining over 3% in the second trading week of 2024.\n\nAs the inflation levels slow, the Federal Reserve is poised to begin cutting interest rates from March, which should boost equities. According to the FedWatch tool, the federal funds futures forecast a 79% probability of a rate cut in March. The declining borrowing costs should allow growth stocks to gain momentum in the upcoming months.\n\nWith lingering recession concerns and geopolitical tensions, investing in large-cap growth stocks can allow investors to capitalize on the expected bull run without assuming too much risk amid the tumultuous market backdrop.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nMicrosoft Corp.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is on track to become the world's largest company in terms of market cap, as its shares rose by over 5% last week to hit a market capitalization of $2.89 trillion, surpassing Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) $2.87 trillion market cap.\n\nMicrosoft's strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence (AI) drove the tech behemoth's growth over the past year, as its stake in OpenAI paid off tremendously.\n\n“With co-pilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in an earnings release. “We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft acquired Activision Blizzard Inc. in a historic merger, allowing the former to become the third-largest gaming company in terms of revenue. Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to rise by over 14% year over year to $243.8 billion in fiscal 2024. In addition, the consensus annual earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $11.24 indicates an 11.6% improvement year over year.\n\nPiper Sandler has an Overweight rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of $455, indicating a potential upside of over 17%.\n\nEli Lilly and Co.\n\nEli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY), one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., recently made headlines as its weight-loss drug Zepbound went viral shortly after its launch in November. The weekly prescription demand for Zepbound crossed 25,000 per week by the end of December, surpassing the current supply level for the drug.\n\nAmid supply shortage concerns, Eli Lilly plans to build a new factory in Germany while expanding its facility in North Carolina.\n\nAnalysts expect Eli Lilly's financials to improve significantly as the demand for Zepbound remains strong. The consensus revenue estimate of $8.5 billion for the fiscal first quarter ending in March indicates a 22.1% rise year over year. The company's EPS is expected to increase by over 54% year over year to $2.51 in the ongoing quarter.\n\nShares of Eli Lilly have been one of the best-performing pharma stocks over the past year, surging by over 77%.\n\nNvidia Corp.\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock with its shares rising by more than 220% over the past year. The relatively new chip manufacturer made its name by capitalizing on the AI boom, designing chips catering to AI-related tasks.\n\nNvidia's chips hold an 85% market share in the artificial intelligence sector, making it the industry leader with a substantial competitive advantage. Shares of Nvidia have risen by nearly 10.5% so far this year.\n\nAs the AI boom gains traction, Nvidia is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing companies in the near term. The company's dominant market position has allowed it to maintain robust demand in international markets as well — China keeps buying Nvidia chips despite growing geopolitical tensions with the U.S.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to rise 231.8% year over year to $20.08 billion in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ending in January. In addition, the consensus EPS estimate of $4.5 for the current quarter indicates a 411.4% rise from the same period last year.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "title": "AI Ambassadors: 3 Stocks Leading the Intelligent Tech Revolution",
        "content": "To say that AI stocks are popular with investors in 2024 would be an understatement.\n\nIn mid-December, Bloomberg published an article entitled The Year of Nvidia, AI Stocks and Lofty Valuations. As it highlighted, the Nasdaq 100 had its best year in 2023 in more than a decade.\n\nThrough the first two weeks of January, the index is up 1.5%. Something tells me that 2024 won’t be much different. Consequentially, the intelligent tech revolution should benefit AI stocks in the next 11.5 months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, who are the AI ambassadors to bet on? Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with expected profits of $48 billion in the next 12 months, should be at the top of any list.\n\nHowever, that would be like taking candy from a baby.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes that almost 40% of global jobs will be affected by AI. In fact, the wealthier countries may face more significant risks than poorer ones. Therefore, if that’s the case, I’m inclined to go with AI ambassadors who use the technology to reduce income inequality, not vice versa.\n\nLet’s examine my three choices.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre’s (NASDAQ:MELI) Sebastián Barrios is the Latin American e-commerce and payments giant’s senior vice president of technology. He discussed its use of AI with Bloomberg Linea last October.\n\nThe company is primarily interested in using AI to improve the customer experience.\n\n“Barrios highlighted that the company has been invested in a series of AI initiatives to achieve significant improvements in the user experience, from personalization in the purchasing process to the automation of internal processes,” Bloomberg Linea stated on Oct. 25, 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the executive was adamant that AI would provide more opportunities for more people at MercadoLibre. This lies in contrast to the IMF’s perception that 40% of jobs are at risk of disappearing. Of course, Barrios did say that the company continues hiring based on the demand for its products and services in its operating countries.\n\nStory continues\n\n“At Mercado libre, we are hiring and we continue to accelerate in hiring because we see that as an accelerator of what we can do. Fortunately, what we need is more capable people to develop more value for users.”\n\nHe states that MercadoLibre aims to “democratize” access to commerce and finance through electronic transactions. To me, that sounds a lot like MELI is using AI to level the playing field through fintech.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) Silhouette of person holding mobile phone with SoFi (SOFI) logo shown in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nLike MercadoLibre, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) focuses on delivering to the masses top-notch financial products that are easy to access and use. It makes sense, given that inequality is generally about lack of opportunity and financial wherewithal.\n\n“SoFi’s mission is to help people reach financial independence to realize their ambitions. Financial independence doesn’t just mean being rich; it means getting to a point where your money works for the life you want to live,” states the SoFi investor relations home page.\n\nOver the past year, SOFI stock has gained 37%. However, on three occasions in the past 12 months, when its share price got near or over $10, something always brought the stock back down to below $7 or $8, where it currently trades. It’s become a hard ceiling to crack.\n\nBut don’t you worry. With the help of AI, it will break through $10 in 2024 and make its way to $20 in 2025.\n\nWhy do I feel this way?\n\nIn August 2023, SoFi’s Galileo Financial Technologies business reported on its AI-driven intelligent digital assistant (IDA). Cyberbank Konecta had been integrated into its tech stack, improving inquiry response times by more than 65%.\n\n“Through Galileo’s flexible APIs and AI-driven technology, Cyberbank Konecta has helped SoFi achieve immediate cost-reduction by freeing up valuable agent time to solve more complex and higher-touch problems for SoFi’s members,” stated its press release.\n\n“Customer service performance has improved by 7%, meaning addressing thousands more conversations 24/7 without the need for member service agents.”\n\nOn the surface, this insinuates that SoFI is doing more with less because of AI. In the short term, that may be the case. However, with the ability to scale its customer base through AI, it will add millions of members in the future. And this will require additional human resources to solve the more complex and higher-touch problems mentioned above.\n\nFrom the day SoFi announced its acquisition of Galileo in April 2020, I thought it was a slam dunk winner. AI will prove it so.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike the other two stocks mentioned, Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) will use AI to dramatically improve the merchant experience. And, in turn, it will put more money in the pockets of these merchants.\n\nTherefore, as far as I’m concerned, the best way to reduce inequality is to put more money and opportunities into the hands of those less fortunate. This allows them to use the e-commerce platform to generate a reasonable living.\n\nIn July 2023, Shopify launched a new suite of AI products for merchants to use on the e-commerce platform that it believes will benefit its customers.\n\n“Shopify believes that there isn’t any corner of the internet that will benefit more from AI than the pursuit of people building and growing their own businesses,” Miqdad Jaffer, Shopify’s director of product for AI, told The Globe and Mail. “There is still so much untapped potential for AI and entrepreneurs, and we’re both excited and deeply committed to making the power of AI accessible to businesses of all sizes.”\n\nSo, with the help of Sidekick and Shopify Magic, merchants can accelerate their ability to grow their businesses through these AI tools. These tools will benefit Shopify’s smaller merchants, who likely don’t have the staffing to provide top-notch customer service.\n\nFrom where I sit, Shopify and its merchants have significant opportunities ahead of them, thanks to AI. The next five years should be exhilarating for employees, merchant customers, and shareholders.\n\nShopify most definitely is an AI ambassador.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Value Vault: 3 Forgotten Dividend Aristocrats Offering Steady Income",
        "content": "When we imagine dividend aristocrats, a handful of big names take the spotlight. AT&T (NYSE:T), Realty Income (NYSE:O), Exxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM) — these are some of the common names investors flock to when finding income-generating options for their portfolio.\n\nBut these names aren’t the only game in town and, in some cases, aren’t worth the investment beyond a little cash generation. Finding dividend aristocrats worth investing in today should balance three criteria: market stability (considering the current economic landscape), growth and expansion opportunities, and yield. Staking your cash on just one of those three parameters isn’t always enough. For example, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) is one of the highest-yielding dividend aristocrats around. But if you’re chasing the stock for yield alone, you could get blindsided by a mountain of lawsuits affecting the stock’s bottom line.\n\nThat’s why yield isn’t the be-all-end-all. By comparison, these stocks have a long, fruitful future ahead while offering consistent distributions typical of the best dividend aristocrats around.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStanley Black & Decker (SWK) Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security products\n\nSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com\n\nStanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a giant among the home improvement and hardware set, owning industry notables that include DeWalt, Craftsman, and (of course) Stanley and Black & Decker. In fact, if you go to your local hardware store for power tools, chances are you’re walking out with a SWK product.\n\nSWK faced some headwinds in recent months, as tightening construction markets and reduced DIY enthusiasm put a damper on product sales. But the company embarked on an aggressive series of cost-cutting initiatives, including divestitures, that should prove effective when its Q4 earnings drop early next month.\n\nThose initiatives are already bearing fruit, as its Q3 earnings (released last October) saw margins climb 4% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and an end-of-year EPS adjustment upwards to $1.40 per share at the high end. The company’s inventory management attempts also proved successful as it trimmed $300 million from its balance sheet even amid flat sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf SWK hits even the low end of its adjusted EPS range for 2023 — $1.10 — expect this dividend aristocrat to rebound in a big way.\n\nGenuine Parts Co (GPC) 5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGenuine Parts Co (NYSE:GPC) is a juggernaut in the automotive and industrial spaces, capturing two-thirds of total sales in the first category and one-third in the second. If that stat doesn’t scream stability, I don’t know what does. But, trading at just 0.86x sales, there’s a strong argument to be made that the dividend aristocrat is materially undervalued despite its sector strength.\n\nThe company’s last report showed decent year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth of 2.6%, but the real story was in its income expansion, which clocked in at 12.4% YoY. Likewise, management revised its end-of-year income estimate upward to $9.30 per share.\n\nBut beyond quarterly financials, GPC’s strength lies in its ongoing strategic capital management. Though the company’s total yield consistently clocks in at or above 3%, its payout ratio is remarkably low (42.27% as of this writing). This is notable because GPC is notoriously debt-averse. Instead, the company relies heavily on cash flow rather than leverage to fuel operational growth and return value to shareholders. This might seem like standard practice, but with many companies assuming hefty debt loads to snatch up shares in buybacks or pay off investors, GPC’s “old school” capital structure is a breath of fresh air.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn my mind, there’s no better mix of stability and growth opportunities than you’ll find with Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). I’m a healthcare mega-bull. I think it’s one of the few broad sectors worth throwing the bulk of your capital at if you can understand some of the company-specific complexities. After all, there will always be demand for healthcare, and today’s top companies usually prove adept at navigating changing trends and tech. Medtronic is no exception and truly stands out as one of the best dividend aristocrats positioned to take the leap into the next era of investments.\n\nThat sentiment is evident from Medtronic’s partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop an AI-powered diagnostic platform, but it doesn’t end there. Earlier this month, CEO Geoff Martha told conference attendees, “We’re harnessing the power of AI today for use in clinical decision support, creating new indications, and delivering personalized treatments” and that Medtronic is “uniquely positioned to advance AI and medtech.”\n\nMedtronic’s current total yield sits at 3.39%, with most of that coming from distributions. The company is prepped to post earnings in late February, but if its last report is any indication, investors should ready themselves for another blowout.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Can you imagine what it would be like to suddenly be without computers? Machines are a daily part of our lives, whether we’re at work, school, or home. Computers help us perform work, operate our vehicles and make items in our homes operate more smoothly. Operating all those machines are software, which is why buying A-rated software stocks is a smart investing decision.\n\nSoftware stocks represent companies that make the programs, data, and instructions that prompt a computer system to perform specific functions. Some companies make and sell system software, which manages hardware and provides operating systems, drivers and utilities.\n\nThen there’s application software, which includes word processing programs, spreadsheets, video editing software, design tools and other products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll of these are critical for today’s computers to bring the magic of modern technology to life.\n\nWe’ll use the Portfolio Grader to pick out some A-rated software stocks based on the companies’ earnings performance, revenue and profit growth, analyst sentiment and momentum. These seven stocks give you the best chance to invest in software companies this January.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best software companies on the planet, and it’s one of the biggest companies in the world. Microsoft’s market cap is at $2.85 trillion, putting it on the path to $3 trillion. It could become the largest publicly traded company by year-end.\n\nMicrosoft’s Windows operating system is by far the dominant operating system in the U.S., installed on an estimated 63% of desktop computers. It also makes and sells Microsoft 365, a package of software programs that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more. Microsoft 365 has a market share of roughly 48%, and generates more than $60 billion in annual revenue.\n\nMicrosoft generated $211.9 billion in revenue for its 2023 fiscal year and $73.4 billion in profit. And its fiscal 2024 year is off to a good start, with revenue in the first quarter (ending Sept. 30, 2023) of $56.5 billion. That’s an increase of 13% from the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMSFT stock is up 60% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) provides cloud-based software that helps businesses manage sales, marketing, customer service and customer workflow.\n\nIts customer relationship management software gives businesses a valuable tool and centralized location that allows them to track and manage client information, whether they’re in the office or using a mobile device.\n\nIts Einstein platform uses the power of generative artificial intelligence to customize client interactions, summarize emails, and draft responses. That’s an important tool in providing outstanding customer service.\n\nThe company posted revenue of $8.72 billion in the third fiscal quarter of 2024 (ending Oct. 31, 2023), which was an increase of 11% from the previous year. Analysts expect Salesforce to generate earnings per share of $9.56 in 2024.\n\nCRM stock is up 80% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCadence Design Systems (CDNS) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. semiconductor stocks to buy and hold\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) provides software to power electronic systems, such as semiconductors and circuit boards.\n\nThat’s a lucrative business today, as computer manufacturers are scrambling to design chips and servers that can handle Internet of Things applications, generative AI and machine learning.\n\nCadence has a hand in some of the most talked-about products on the market today. For example, it partnered with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to help design full self-driving and SOJO AI supercomputer chips that Tesla’s new Cybertruck uses for car navigation, computer vision video processing and recognition.\n\nEarnings for the third quarter were $1.02 billion in revenue, an increase from $903 million in the previous year. Net income was $254 million and 93 cents per share, up from $186 million and 68 cents per share a year ago.\n\nCDNS stock is up 55% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCleanSpark (CLSK) A blue-toned concept image showing Bitcoin (BTC) cracking in half.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK)  is a miner of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). It owns and operates five data centers in Georgia and one in Massena, New York. It fully owns the Georgia centers and co-operates the data center in New York.\n\nCleanSpark has nearly 89,000 Bitcoin miners and holds just over 3,000 Bitcoin. It mines at 10 exahashes per second, which it partly attributes to its optimized software.\n\nAnd that should only be the beginning. CleanSpark has a deal to purchase up to another 160,000 miners, giving it another 32 exahashes per second of production.\n\nAnd as the price of Bitcoin continues to increase (particularly now that it can be traded through Bitcoin ETFs) CleanSpark’s profits should also rise.\n\nRevenue for the 2023 fiscal year (ending September 30, 2023) was $168.4 million, up 28% from a year ago. And while the net loss increased due to CleanSpark scaling up, I expect major steps toward profitability in 2024.\n\nCLSK stock is up more than 300% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSilverSun Technologies (SSNT) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSilverSun Technologies (NASDAQ:SSNT) is a New Jersey technology and consulting company that buys and builds out technology and software companies.\n\nIt offers digital transformation expertise for accounting and business management, financial reporting, warehouse management, customer relations and business intelligence, all designed to help software companies improve customer experiences, be more efficient, generate revenue and pivot in response to changing conditions.\n\nWhile headquartered in New Jersey, the company focuses on the New York metropolitan area as well as Chicago, Arizona, North Carolina, Washington, Oregon and southern California.\n\nRevenue in the third quarter was $13.4 million, an increase of 23% from the previous year. And while the company posted a net loss of $2.1 million, that’s an outlier as it had a nearly $3 million additional expense from its terminated merger with Rhodium Enterprises.\n\nThe company’s stock soared in December when billionaire Brad Jacobs reached a $1 billion investment deal with SilverSun that will lead to him being the majority shareholder and chief executive and chairman. As part of the deal, the existing business will be spun off to SilverSun shareholders, and Jacobs will keep the remaining company as a standalone company that will operate under a new name.\n\nThat’s why you now see SSNT stock up 430% in the last year. The spinoff could be a lucrative opportunity.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a California-based software company that operates a cloud computing platform that provides digital workflow management tools.\n\nIt also has a partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that allows it to use Nvidia’s software and infrastructure to develop large language models for ServiceNow’s platform in exchange for Nvidia using ServiceNow’s workflow management to help it develop better semiconductor chips and generative AI.\n\nConsidering that Nvidia is the No. 1 name in generative AI, ServiceNow’s partnership got much attention and investor interest.\n\nNot surprisingly, 2023 was a great year for the cloud computing company. ServiceNow reported third-quarter revenue of $2.28 billion, up 25% from a year ago. Subscription revenue of $2.21 billion was up 27% from last year.\n\nNOW stock is up 77% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an education technology company.

That’s up 47% and 63%, respectively, in just one year.\n\nThe company’s also getting more efficient. It announced it dismissed about 10% of its contracted workforce because the work can be done through generative AI.

        "title": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Nvidia (NVDA) is a Great Choice",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Nvidia (NVDA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if NVDA is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor NVDA, shares are up 11.43% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry is up 0.4% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 13.66% compares favorably with the industry's 1.07% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Nvidia have risen 29.13%, and are up 218.51% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 9.43% and 20.94%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to NVDA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. NVDA is currently averaging 34,334,104 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with NVDA.\n\nOver the past two months, 15 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NVDA's consensus estimate, increasing from $10.90 to $12.31 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 13 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NVDA is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Nvidia on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "InterDigital, Inc. IDCC released preliminary fourth-quarter 2023 results. The selective preliminary metrics offer clarity regarding the company's operations and shed light on the first-quarter 2024 outlook.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, InterDigital is likely to have generated revenues of $105 million. The net sales figure is aligned with company guidance and mainly includes recurring revenues. The company is likely to release a value allowance as it is optimistic about realizing the benefits of deferred tax assets in some foreign jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nOwing to these factors, IDCC is likely to have recorded a GAAP net income of $34 million, indicating a significant increase from the earlier estimate of $18-$21 million. The earnings per share is expected at $1.20, up from 70-80 cents anticipated earlier. Higher litigation costs and performance-based compensation are likely to have increased the operating expenses to $81 million, up from the earlier expected range of $77-$79 million.\r\n\r\nThe company is expected to have registered a non-GAAP net income of $36 million or $1.34 per share, exceeding the prior estimates of $31-$34 million and $1.17-$1.29, respectively.

Operating expenses are anticipated in the band of $146-$154 million, including revenue share expense of $66-$69 million.\r\n\r\nNotably, InterDigital recently inked a patent license agreement with Samsung, the largest TV manufacturer and industry leader in consumer electronics.

        "content": "Nvidia NVDA, the trillion-dollar chipmaker, has witnessed a remarkable 10% increase in its shares within the first nine trading days of 2024. This follows a significant 240% rise in its stock price during 2023, driven by advancements in AI technology, per a Business Insider article.\n\nThe company's market capitalization has escalated by $128 billion, reaching nearly $1.4 trillion, making it the fifth most valuable company in the U.S., behind leading giants like Microsoft, Apple, Google's Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nOutshining Competitors and Indices\n\nNvidia has outperformed not only its Big Tech rivals but also the benchmark S&P 500 in the early days of 2024. The AI investment trend is a key factor, with analysts predicting continued strong performance for the company.\n\nThis year marks Nvidia's best start in terms of market capitalization gains. It's outpacing the other \"Magnificent Seven\" mega-cap stocks, while companies like Microsoft and Meta Platforms show modest gains. Conversely, Apple and Tesla have experienced declines.\n\nMarket Stagnation Elsewhere\n\nWhile Nvidia thrives, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices have remained stagnant, following their significant gains in the previous year.\n\nAI's Role in Nvidia's Success\n\nNvidia's surge is closely tied to the AI investment craze, with its dominance in graphics processing units significantly boosting earnings and helping it achieve a 12-figure valuation.\n\nNew Developments and Market Expansion\n\nAt the recent CES trade show, Nvidia unveiled three new desktop graphics chips, aimed at AI personal computers. This move, signaling potential new revenue streams, led to an 11% rise in shares over three days. Kathleen Brooks from XTB highlighted Nvidia's expansion into AI PC space as a key growth driver.\n\nWall Street's Positive Outlook\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average price target for Nvidia comes to $646.54. The forecasts range from a low of $410.00 to a high of $1,100.00. The average price target represents an increase of 18.18% from the last closing price of $547.10 (as of Jan 15, 2024).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.23 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.18 a month ago based on 37 recommendations.\n\nOf the 37 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 31 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.78% and 8.11% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 86.49%, while Buy represented 8.11%.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH – NVIDIA has 19.84% Focus\n\nAXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI – NVIDIA has 18.25% Exposure\n\nSimplify Volt RoboCar Disruption and Tech ETF VCAR – NVIDIA has 14.05% Exposure\n\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ – NVIDIA has 13.29% Exposure\n\nZacks Rank #2 Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK – NVIDIA has 13.09% Exposure\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Could Investing $20,000 in Nvidia Make You a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Semiconductor designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has made many millionaires in recent years. Its stock has more than tripled in the last year alone. Among stocks with a market cap of at least $50 billion today, Nvidia has outperformed absolutely everybody over the past three, five, and 10 years. It's hard to beat this wealth-building machine these days.\n\nSo what's next? Let's say I scrape together a robust $20,000 Nvidia position today -- can I expect to make a million dollars on that investment?\n\nThe short answer is yes, but it'll take a while and the lofty target result isn't guaranteed.\n\nNvidia in the rearview mirror\n\nLooking back, Nvidia's stock chart from the past eight years is nothing short of extraordinary. Starting from a respectable $23 billion market cap in 2016, the company's strategy has shifted along with the market opportunity.\n\nNvidia's expertise in high-performance graphics cards for gaming and professional graphics turned into a crypto bonanza when enthusiasts found the same cards to be excellent for mining Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) tokens. Just as Ethereum switched to a different technology with no need for miners, OpenAI came along with its ChatGPT tool, unveiling a new dawn in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Based on the same high-end graphics platforms as the gaming and crypto surges, Nvidia's AI accelerator processors powered the back-end creation of ChatGPT's AI engine.\n\nNow, lots of companies with AI-powered ambitions are buying hundreds or even thousands of extremely pricey accelerator chips and Nvidia is the first supplier that comes to mind at this point. It shows in Nvidia's spectacular financial results and the stock chart that follows: NVDA Chart\n\nThe chart above shows the return of a $20,000 investment started on May 16, 2016, resulting in a $1.0 million value nearly 8 years later. That's an average annual return of 67.4%.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAt the end of that market-crushing chart, Nvidia is worth $1.4 trillion. The stock rose to this height the hard way, delivering top-notch products attuned to the right market opportunities at the right times. The end result is a legendary price gain with record-high investor returns. Sorting the total stock market's 10-year gains, I don't even need to limit the field with a large market-cap requirement to weed out short-lived meme stocks and other gadflies. Nvidia simply offered the strongest decade-long returns of any stock tracked by the screeners at my disposal.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut things are different now. It may be difficult to grow a $23 billion market cap 50-fold, but even tougher when you start with a $1.3 trillion stock-value footprint. Even if Nvidia continues to dominate the AI market, and that trend delivers on the most striking predictions for years to come, it's unrealistic to assume an average annual return of 67% for another eight-year run.\n\nBy the end of that rainbow, Nvidia would be worth $67.6 trillion. That's more than double the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States, estimated at $26.9 billion in 2023. I'm sorry, but that's going to take a while.\n\nBalancing business growth and shareholder rewards\n\nNvidia's past performance has set a high bar and it's important to manage your expectations for the next phase of its AI business. The exceptional gains of recent years are not likely to continue for another 8-year span. That would require not only continued success in the booming AI sector for nearly a full decade, but also sustained hypergrowth in the market itself and unshaken investor confidence in Nvidia's lofty valuation ratios. The stock trades at 72 times earnings and 30 times sales today. These overheated ratios should cool down over time, raising the needed financial support for that $67 trillion market cap in the process.\n\nOf course, Nvidia could lower the bar with some accounting tricks. The company can return cash to shareholders by means of generous share buybacks and dividends.\n\nOther companies have pursued this strategy before. For example, International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) has seen its share price fall by 2% over the last 10 years while its market cap shrunk by 14%. At the same time, Big Blue bought back 12% of its issued shares and delivered robust dividend payouts. All in all, IBM investors pocketed a respectable total return of 50% over the same period.\n\nNvidia could attempt a larger-scale version of this, boosting the returns by sharing cash profits with the company's investors. Of course, this cash-sharing idea takes away from the company's freedom to invest in future growth-boosting business plans, so there's a fine line between generosity and growth-blunting missteps.\n\nAnd of course, anything is possible over a long enough time span. America's GDP stopped at $1.5 trillion in 1973, comparable to Nvidia's market value today. Suggesting that any single company could deserve a trillion-dollar market cap would have sounded ridiculous 50 years ago, but here we stand with 6 stocks in the trillion-dollar club. A few decades from now, that $67 trillion target might not look so silly anymore.\n\nThe real question is, will Nvidia still be around in 2064 or 2074, and will it dominate its chosen markets for that long? I don't think so, but anything is possible.\n\nA pragmatic approach to investing in Nvidia\n\nSo yes, Nvidia just might be able to grow that a $20,000 investment into a cool million, but it's a long road to that ambitious target and many things can go wrong along the way. Remember, this stock delivered the richest shareholder returns of any company over the last decade, and even that stellar run barely exceeded the 50-fold gain it takes to meet that goal.\n\nThat being said, I'm not closing out my own Nvidia position anytime soon, though I might take advantage of its recent moonshot by diversifying some of the gains into other investment ideas. I'm still looking at a proven AI giant with a bright future, and its valuation has calmed down a bit in recent weeks. Buying Nvidia stock today makes perfect sense if you can stomach it trading at nosebleed-inducing prices. The next wave of processor orders for AI systems could make the last surge look forgettable by comparison.\n\nSo feel free to invest in Nvidia today. Just don't expect the incredible returns of the last 8 years to continue for another multi-year span. To make me a happy Nvidia investor, all the company needs to do is deliver stock price gains comparable to or exceeding the stock market as a whole.\n\nAt an annual clip of 15%, a 50-fold return would materialize after 28 years. Patience is a virtue, dear reader.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a Chinese company that designs, develops and manufactures electric vehicles. Its current products consist of four vehicles, the soon-to-released Li MEGA and three SUVs L7, L8 and L9.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Li Auto achieved strong financials, driven by a remarkable 182.2% YoY increase in total vehicle deliveries, which reached a total of 376,030 vehicles. Its revenue stands at $13.665 billion, reflecting a YoY increase of roughly 108.11%. In addition, the company increased its operating cash flow from $1.070 billion in December 2022 to $5.249 billion, a growth of 390.53%. As a result, LI has become China’s best-selling emerging new energy automaker, surpassing similar competitors such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV).\n\nMoreover, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently announced a partnership with Li Auto, whose vehicles will utilize DRIVE Thor, Nvidia’s latest car computer. This collaboration brings many functions such as automated driving, passenger monitoring and much more. Thus, the company’s customers will benefit from these advantages, which could lead to a larger growth in sales.\n\nTesla Inc (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an American automotive and clean energy company and is a leader in the electric vehicle industry.\n\nTSLA’s financials are fantastic on all fronts indicated by its EV sales which are 486.69% more than the sector average. Revenue growth was 29.94% meaning it was 448.22% more than the sector median of 5.46%. EPS diluted growth was also an outstanding 2,705.06% more than the sector median and EBITA margin was 47.15% more than the median as well.\n\nTSLA’s new Cyber Truck is getting mixed reviews, but this shouldn’t be too alarming. As TSLA continues innovating the way it has with the Cyber Truck, a new product should hit gold sparking a bull run. Once one product gains traction, generally others will follow suit. If TSLA continues innovating, its financials will only get better, and with rising financials come an unlimited ceiling. This unlimited ceiling potential is why I view TSLA as one of the top EV stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A Reuters report revealed on Jan. 11 that India data center company Yotta plans to purchase more AI GPUs from Nvidia worth $500 million, taking its total order book with the chipmaker to $1 billion.\n\nNvidia will have to contend with increased competition in the chip market this year as various rivals release their own AI GPUs. However, the industry is expanding rapidly, with the company's dominance unlikely to falter any time soon.\n\nHere's why Nvidia's stock remains a no-brainer buy this January.\n\nNvidia's AI supremacy has staying power\n\nOver the last year, countless companies have announced ventures into the AI chip market after witnessing Nvidia's meteoric rise. Leading chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Intel both have plans to begin shipping new GPUs soon in an attempt to chip away at Nvidia's market share. Plenty of companies new to the industry are also joining in, with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet all announcing ventures into AI chips last year.\n\nHowever, history suggests Nvidia's sovereignty will be a tough nut to crack. The company has held an over 80% market share in desktop GPUs for years, despite AMD's and Intel's presence in the sector.\n\nIntel only joined the industry last year, while AMD's history in desktop GPUs spans decades. Still, AMD's chips are more popular with enthusiasts than large-volume system builders, and they only represent about 10% of the market.\n\nA similar situation has occurred in another area of the chip market. Intel was a king in central processing units (CPUs) for years, with an 82% market share at the start of 2017 when AMD landed on the scene with its Ryzen line of CPUs. AMD has managed to steal a significant share from Intel since then. However, Intel still holds a market share above 60% in CPUs, with AMD's share at 35%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia's rise to the top of AI saw it attain an estimated 90% market share in AI GPUs. There may be an onslaught of new rivals in the industry this year, but history suggests the company will likely remain the preferred chip supplier for years.\n\nMajor upside over the next two years\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206% year over year, hitting $18 billion. Meanwhile, operating income soared more than 1,600% to $10 billion. This immense growth was mainly due to a 279% increase in data center revenue, representing a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nNvidia has enjoyed multiple quarters of glowing results due to a surge in chip demand, but the industry appears to be just getting started. According to data from Grand View Research, the AI market hit $197 billion last year and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. That trajectory would see the sector exceed $1 trillion before the end of the decade, suggesting Nvidia still has plenty of room left to run.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia is profiting from a gradual recovery in the PC market. PC shipments have been in decline for much of the last two years because of macroeconomic headwinds, falling 16% in 2022 and continuing to tumble for most of 2023. However, a recovery finally seems to be underway.\n\nPC shipments increased by 0.3% in Q4 2023. Meanwhile, Nvidia's gaming segment (which includes PC component sales) reported revenue growth of 81% in its latest quarter.\n\nAlongside AI, Nvidia could be in for another stellar growth year in 2024 as PC sales improve. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nMoreover, the chart above shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. That figure, multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45, implies a potential stock price of $1,080 per share, projecting a potential growth of 91% over the next two fiscal years. It's a lofty target, but based on reasonable financial projections.\n\nNvidia still has plenty to offer new investors with its powerful role in AI and secular tailwinds in other areas of tech, making its stock a no-brainer right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks With Big Catalysts Coming in Q1",
        "content": "With the artificial intelligence (AI) buzz capturing global attention, discerning investors must identify stocks with concrete revenue gains from AI. Analysts project the AI revolution as the fourth industrial revolution, foreseeing widespread applications across industries. Notable sectors like cybersecurity have successfully employed AI for threat detection, showcasing its potential beyond early adopters like Google.\n\nThat said, these innovative players, marked by market dominance and cutting-edge advancements, are poised for growth after a successful 2023. Let’s dive into the reasons these three companies remain among the top AI stocks for the upcoming year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) defied skeptics and proved to be a financial market favorite.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) Vivek Arya notes Nvidia’s robust free cash flow, providing strategic flexibility. In fact, Arya anticipates Nvidia exploring assets for a more substantial recurring revenue profile. Additionally, Wedbush’s Dan Ives is similarly optimistic. He asserts the start of a new tech bull market anchored in AI hardware industry growth.\n\nAlso, in 2023, Nvidia dominated the market for generative AI chips, propelling NVDA stock to a remarkable 269% increase. With a revenue surge of 206% in Q3, reaching $18.12 billion, Nvidia became the sixth-largest publicly traded company globally.\n\nNvidia boasts an 85% market share in accelerator chips. Despite challenges in the China market, NVDA remains robust with excellent fundamentals, trading at just 24-times FY2025 earnings. Therefore, expectations are positive for sustained strength in the coming year.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) operates in the AI sector without direct competitors. While large enterprise software firms could be potential rivals, founder Thomas Siebel noted unawareness of a competitive product from Oracle.\n\nStory continues\n\nC3.ai provides tools for optimizing operations and making data-driven forecasts. Recent agreements Nucor and the U.S. Navy, along with partnerships with Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft, showcase its growing presence.\n\nIn September, Siebel acknowledged the decision to postpone non-GAAP profitability due to heavy investments in generative AI. The Q2 2024 results revealed a 17% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth. This marks an improvement from previous quarters.\n\nAs anticipated, the company brought in a non-GAAP operating loss of $25.0 million in Q2. This was higher when compared to $15.0 million in the previous year. But for those seeking top-line growth, many look to C3.ai as an AI beneficiary that may be able to pick things up in Q1.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2023, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) faced stiff competition due to its delayed entry into generative AI.\n\nHowever, 2024 brings a turnaround. The release of Instinct MI300 accelerators underscores their capability of running generative AI applications. Projected to ship 400,000 units, AMD anticipates significant revenue growth. The Ryzen 8040 Series processors for laptops add to its revenue streams.\n\nWhile data center revenue remained stable, client-based revenue increased by 42%. Additionally, gaming segment earnings slightly decreased, and the embedded segment saw a slight decline.\n\nAt this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, AMD unveiled new silicon for PCs, featuring desktop CPUs and the budget-friendly Radeon RX 7600 XT graphics card. This marks the introduction of the Ryzen 8000 series for desktops. And the top offerings boast dedicated Neural Processing Units (NPUs), enhancing AI-focused workload capabilities for Photoshop, Zoom, and Windows 11 apps.\n\nWith a 120% increase in the last year, AMD stock shows resilience and earns an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Wall Street analysts conduct plenty of research before deciding which stocks to recommend. It’s part of their full-time jobs which makes them more present in the industry than most retail investors.\n\nInvestors can save a lot of time by reviewing analysts’ recommendations. However, an investor shouldn’t take an analyst’s recommendation at face value. Instead, investors should consider what the analyst says about the stock they are recommending. If the analyst brings up several points that make you excited about the stock, then it may be a good opportunity. However, it’s also possible that an analyst focuses on the wrong area or misses an important detail.\n\nBuying long-term stocks can save you even more time since you only have to buy them once and then let them sit in your portfolio. Investors who feel confident about a company can easily accumulate more shares without doing as much research the next time. Investors looking for long-term stocks may want to consider these Wall Street favorites.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a juggernaut for investors. The company is a leader in artificial intelligence and has experienced exceptional growth in multiple business verticals.\n\nIt’s no wonder that Nvidia topped the list as a Wall Street favorite. Shares have appreciated by 231% over the past year and have gained roughly 1,300% over the past five years. The stock is even off to a strong start with year-to-date (YTD) gains exceeding 10%.\n\nNvidia’s exceptional revenue and earnings growth have fueled the rally and made the stock look relatively affordable. Shares trade at a 28-forward P/E ratio. The Q3 FY24 206% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth and 1,259% YOY net income growth suggest the valuation will get more attractive throughout the year. Also, sequential growth for those metrics has been impressive.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the press release, Jensen Huang stated that Nvidia GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services, and Nvidia AI Enterprise software “are all growth engines in full throttle.”\n\nFurther, Nvidia is at the center of the generative AI boom and stands to reward shareholders. Despite a big rally over several years, Nvidia stock has more room to run.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is another top-rated long-term stock that Wall Street analysts love. The average price target from 21 analysts projects a 45% upside. The highest price target of $275 suggests the stock can go up by over 70%.\n\nHowever, solar panels and other clean energy sources hit a speed bump last year. First Solar lost 11% over the past year which is far better than competitor Enphase‘s (NASDAQ:ENPH) performance. FSLR’s 230% gain over the past five years paints a better picture of its achievement without headwinds.\n\nThe company has been reporting good financials during the sector’s contraction. Net sales reached $801 million in Q3 of 2023, representing a 27.4% YOY growth rate. Net income grew by 645.9% YOY, and the company has a $1.3 billion cash position.\n\nAdditionally, First Solar was already performing well during a slower market for solar panels. However, lower interest rates will reignite demand. FSLR seems poised to be a top beneficiary and can reward investors who load up now.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity stocks have received a lot of love from Wall Street analysts over the years. With cyber attacks on the rise, people will always need to keep their data safe. Small businesses and corporations invest considerable money into their cybersecurity defenses by enhancing software.\n\nCompanies like Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) offer top-notch solutions and generate annual recurring revenue. The stock has been a winner for long-term investors with a 190% gain over the past year. Shares have gained an even more impressive 342% over the past five years.\n\nAlso, a shift to profitability gives investors another reason to be bullish on the cybersecurity leader. The company delivered record profitability in Q3 of 2024 while increasing revenue by 35% YOY.\n\nFinally, Crowdstrike has 35 buy ratings and one hold rating from 36 analysts. While the 12-month forecast hints at a small downside from the current price, new analyst price targets have been coming in at above $300/share. Most new analyst price targets based on up-to-date information indicate more upside for the stock.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "7 Dow Stocks Poised to Shine in a Strong 2024 U.S. Economy",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is widely expected to continue to perform well in 2024. The index represents 30 of the most prominent U.S. firms that are considered to be the most important Equities within the New York Stock Exchange and the nasdaq.\n\nThe Dow is widely considered to be a representative barometer of the U.S. economy and stock market overall. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to cut rates multiple times which will serve to propel the index higher. So, it’s reasonable to broadly invest in the Dow Jones Industrial index and expect returns. That said, there are better Dow stocks amongst the 30 in which to invest.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith approximately a week left until American Express (NYSE:AXP) releases 4th quarter earnings investors should consider purchasing the stock. The company has done very well over the last year as Americans rack up record credit card debt.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat debt also comes with high interest rates due to high Fed funds rates intended to tamp down inflation. American Express provided strong fundamentals when it released its third quarter results months ago. However, investors should also anticipate that the fourth quarter will be strong.\n\nHoliday spending ended up being strong after expectations wavered. That implies that credit card spending will have been strong as well which bolsters the investment case for American Express.\n\nThe net result is that American Express will have created a new set of assets in the form of accounts payable during the last year or so. Again, consumers are leveraging credit at record rates and the interest charges are currently very high. Those consumers will be repaying American Express for some time to come which will result in stronger top and bottom line results overall for some time to come.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nIt’s easy to see why investors might be tempted to avoid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock early in 2024. The year hasn’t started out very well at all. iPhone sales in China continue to slump. Meanwhile, in the U.S., sales of its Apple watch continue to be blocked. Those blows have prompted prominent analyst houses to downgrade the stock in recent weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat raises an important question for investors: will Apple stand by idly as Microsoft passes it as the most valuable firm globally? The answer of course is no.\n\nBut it won’t be easy. The Chinese government will continue to prefer Huawei phones for its officials over Apple products. That isn’t going to change. That’s part and parcel of a broader conversation around Apple, China, and the US. Apple is going to continue to reassure part of its supply chain and customer base to appealing markets, particularly India.\n\nThere’s potential for Apple to derive wins from that situation. Whether that occurs or not it remains to be seen, of course. At the same time, the company is going to release its Vision Pro headset on Feb. 2 Which is one more reason to find optimism around Apple overall.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf 2024 is like 2023 then Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) will be among the best Dow stocks for investors to hold. In fact, Salesforce shares roughly doubled in 2023. Then, to start 2024, its shares emerged as the strongest performer through the first 10 days of 2024.\n\nOne factor to consider in that regard is the high institutional ownership of Salesforce equity. Institutional ownership accounts for 81% of all holdings of CRM shares. Institutional owners have a lot of collective power and as a result can shift share prices very quickly. If they see something they don’t like and offload their holdings — which tend to be substantial — share prices drop rapidly.\n\nThere are important macroeconomic cyclical reasons to believe that will not be the case. Primarily, the notion that multiple rate cuts are on the horizon. It is currently expected that the Federal Reserve will cut rates three times in 2024, likely beginning in March. That will result in cheaper borrowing which should prompt institutions to invest heavily in customer relationship management overall. That should be a boon to Salesforce which dominates the space.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was a massive winner in 2023 due to the emergence of AI, in particular generative AI. The company’s investment in OpenAI and ChatGPT served to propel its stock price substantially higher throughout the year.\n\nThat said, Microsoft’s connection to the artificial intelligence boom didn’t result in greater revenues. In truth, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the clearest case of a company that actually saw top-line results due to the AI boom; it managed to sell many many more chips leading to greater revenues\n\nMicrosoft, on the other hand, has largely benefited due to the hype surrounding AI to this point. The reason that Microsoft is expected to be strong in 2024 relates to its pursuit of AI-related revenues.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Microsoft’s AI Investments to begin to lift revenues in a substantial manner in 2024. The company has invested heavily in adding AI functionality to its Office suite, referred to as CoPilot. further, Wall Street expects the company’s Cloud Revenue to be boosted substantially by AI in 2024. That potential makes Microsoft one of the best choices on the Dow for 2024.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) Will continue to represent a compelling mix of income and growth potential in 2024. That makes its stock a strong choice throughout 2024.\n\nOn the income side, investors should consider that IBM pays a dividend yielding approximately 4.1% at present. It’s a very safe form of income having last been reduced in 1994. In short, IBM shares are going to continue to appeal to income investors.\n\nThat said, IBM isn’t without compelling growth narratives. Specifically, cloud and quantum computing. Both of those sectors continue to Garner a lot of attention from investors seeking growth opportunities. Cloud computing is expected to continue to strengthen especially due to the introduction of artificial intelligence. At the same time, IBM is a leading firm in the realm of quantum computing. Quantum computing promises to speed the development of artificial intelligence Beyond the capabilities of classic computers.\n\nConsequently, IBM is going to continue to garner a lot of attention for its potent mix of income and growth potential throughout 2024.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Isn’t a particularly flashy company. The company deals primarily in Internet protocol (IP) networking. Again, not flashy and so it’s arguable that Cisco Systems might not ‘shine’ in 2024 because it is somewhat ho-hum.\n\nYet Cisco Systems continues to grow. particularly in relation to revenues. Over the last 12 months revenue has grown at a rate of 12.6%. That rate exceeds the 6.2% revenue growth experienced over the last three years which itself exceeds the revenue growth over the past five years of 5.2%. That alone is a compelling case for the hypothesis that Cisco Systems is heating up.\n\nBroadly speaking, Cloud firms and other enterprises are going to continue to invest in strengthening their respective communications ability. The artificial intelligence opportunity makes that a near certainty.\n\nThat suggests that Cisco Systems growth rate has continued room for growth. Falling interest rates will serve to drive greater investment as lending costs fall which is yet another reason to consider Cisco systems. None of this even considers Cisco Systems’ dividend which currently yields more than 3%.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nArguments that favor investment in Visa (NYSE:V) and its stock are largely the same as those that apply to American Express, above.\n\nVisa has benefited from many of the same factors that have propelled American Express and other credit card firms higher. I won’t waste my time reiterating those factors. Everyone is well aware that credit card spending is at historical levels.\n\nThat truth is reflected in the strong growth rates for Visa during the last 5 years. Somewhat surprisingly, Visa’s revenue growth rate over the last 3 years is actually higher than it was over the last 12 months: 16.8% versus 14.1%.\n\nPerhaps the explanation lies in pandemic stimulus to some degree. Whatever the case, Visa continues to be strong overall with top-line growth well into the double digit rates no matter how you slice it. There continues to be a strong case for investing in credit card companies which have all the potential to outperform average Dow stocks in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Tue, January 16, 2024 at 2:10 PM EST\n\nJosh Schafer\n\nInvestors haven't loved small cap stocks this much in nearly three years\n\nSmall caps have been all the craze on Wall Street over the past two months.\n\nIn fact, according to Bank of America's latest fund managers survey, investors haven't been this bullish on small caps in almost three years.\n\nThe surveyconducted from Jan. 5-11 revealed investors see large cap companies underperforming small cap companies in the next 12 months for the first time since June 2021. A chart from Bank of America shows sentiment around large caps outperforming small caps has deteriorated in recent months. (BofA Global Fund Manager Survey)\n\nSmall caps have ripped higher amid the soft-landing fueled rally, which has seen investors price in roughly six interest rate cuts in 2024 as inflation has fallen faster than many predicted. From late October to mid December, it took just 48 days for the Russell 2000 to rise from a 52-week low to a new 52-week high, marking the fastest turnaround for the index ever, per Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nNow, with the index up over 16% since its October lows, the key question for investors is whether the index has already priced in the future benefits of lower interest rates, limiting the upside in buying small caps.\n\nGoldman Sachs says no.\n\n\"The combination of low current valuations and a healthy economic outlook implies that the Russell 2000 should return roughly 15% in the next 12 months,\" the Goldman Sachs equity strategy team led by David Kostin wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 12.\n\nA key caveat to this call could be if \"investor expectations for economic growth deteriorate.\"\n\nLori Calvasina at RBC Capital Markets has been recommending small cap stocks for months. Much of the Calvasina's case for why small caps could out perform remains in tact. That is: small cap stocks have outperformed in prior interest rate cutting periods—and their exposure to higher interest rates weren't as bad as feared. But a key part of Calvasina's call, that small caps had been oversold, has flipped amid the recent market rally.\n\nThis has Calvasina \"concerned\" about how popular the call for small cap stocks to gain has become.\n\n\"In December it felt like everyone we met with (including the many varieties of investors who are not focused on Small Cap investing) wanted to talk about Small Caps and was constructive on them,\" Calvasina wrote in a note on Jan. 8.\n\nShe added: \"We can’t remember the last time this happened.\" Tue, January 16, 2024 at 1:14 PM EST\n\nInes Ferré\n\nJetBlue-Spirit merger blocked, Spirit shares collapse\n\nSpirit Airlines (SAVE) stock sank as much as 60% on Tuesday after a proposed merger with domestic carrier JetBlue (JBLU) was blocked by a federal judge.\n\nThe ruling is a win for the Department of Justice, which sued to block the deal amid antitrust concerns.\n\nJetBlue's proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit would have created the fifth-largest airline in the US.\n\nOne week ago, JetBlue shares sank more than 10% in one session after the company announced a leadership change, further increasing doubts among investors on whether the merger with Spirit would be approved. JetBlue shares sank 7% after the deal was blocked on Tuesday.\n\n\"Summing it up, if JetBlue were permitted to gobble up Spirit — at least as proposed — it would eliminate one of the airline industry’s few primary competitors that provides unique innovation and price discipline,\" Federal Judge William Young wrote.\n\n\"It would further consolidate an oligopoly by immediately doubling JetBlue's stakeholder size in the industry. Worse yet, the merger would likely incentivize JetBlue further to abandon its roots as a maverick, low-cost carrier.\n\n\"While it is understandable that JetBlue seeks inorganic growth through acquisition of aircraft that would eliminate one of its primary competitors, the proposed acquisition, in this Court’s attempt to predict the future in murky times, does violence to the core principle of antitrust law: to protect the United States' markets — and its market participants — from anticompetitive harm.\" Tue, January 16, 2024 at 1:02 PM EST\n\nInes Ferré\n\nTrending tickers on Tuesday\n\nAMD (AMD)\n\nChipmaker AMD was the #1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance on Tuesday with the stock trading at its highest level since 2021.

        "title": "3 Top-Rated Tech Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are Loving Now: January 2024",
        "content": "While digital innovation served as the backbone of last year’s resilient market performance, investors moving forward may want to concentrate on top-rated tech stocks. Specifically, these ideas have the endorsement of Wall Street analysts who have pegged the enterprises as strong buys.\n\nOf course, you want to do your own research. And it also pays to understand that experts are, at the end of the day, human. They make mistakes just like everybody else. However, the difference is that these folks didn’t just luck into their lofty roles. Rather, they had to prove themselves – and the pressure is on to keep proving themselves.\n\nWhen it comes to top-rated tech stocks, the underlying endorsements are like reality TV cooking shows. You’re only as good as your last meal. Keep forwarding lackluster dishes to the judges and eventually, you’ll be on your way out.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStated differently, a natural incentive exists to put the best foot forward. On that note, below are top-rated tech stocks to consider.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps an obvious idea among innovators, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a result might not seem a compelling idea for top-rated tech stocks. However, it meets the criteria. According to TipRanks, the last rating for MSFT came three days ago – a “buy” from Piper Sandler with a $455 price target, implying over 17% upside. Overall, the average price target lands at $429.15.\n\nFundamentally, Microsoft ranks among the top-rated tech stocks because of its multiple relevancies. Recently, the company has made significant investments in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs). Enticingly, Grand View Research states that the global LLM sector reached a valuation of $4.35 billion last year. Further, the sector could hit $35.43 billion by 2030.\n\nAdding to the narrative, Microsoft commands the desktop PC sector, both in terms of operating system dominance along with productivity tools such as the Microsoft Office 365 suite of business-oriented programs. Although MSFT has already gained almost 62% of equity value in the past 52 weeks, analysts see more upside remaining. That’s a very positive sign.\n\nStory continues\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA global manufacturer of wet processing equipment and production tools, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) represents one of the most vital top-rated tech stocks. Through its cutting-edge equipment, ACM offers delicate silicon wafer cleaning solutions, a crucial step in chip fabrication. As well, the company provides other important needs such as electroplating and stress-free polishing.\n\nWhile it might not get the attention of a “frontline” semiconductor play like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), ACM is critical for the broader chip-manufacturing value chain. As a result, analysts peg shares as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as four buys and one hold. Further, the average price target lands at $28, with the high-side estimate reaching $32.\n\nThough the wafer-cleaning market equipment industry isn’t the sexiest out there, it does enjoy solid growth projections. In 2022, the sector reached a valuation of $7.11 billion. Experts see the space reaching $13.65 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5%. For a no-nonsense, relevant idea, ACMR offers a compelling look for top-rated tech stocks.\n\nAlight (ALIT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTo be sure, Alight (NYSE:ALIT) might not be on everyone’s radar. However, it probably should. According to TipRanks, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy. Also, we’re not talking about unanimity between two people. Rather, eight voices agree that it’s worth a look – nine if you include Bank of America Securities’ positive assessment from June of last year.\n\nEnticingly, the average price target stands at $12.25, implying over 46% upside potential. Further, the max target shoots to $14, projecting over 67% growth. So, why are the suits on Wall Street so eager to buy in? It may come down to the business. As a human capital management platform, Alight streamlines various HR functions such as payroll, benefits administration and employee health and wellness support programs under one umbrella.\n\nFundamentally, that may help reduce costs, particularly administrative overhead. Cynically, this directive may enable companies to seek business “accretive” talent as opposed to backend talent such as HR representatives.\n\nIn full disclosure, ALIT slipped 7% in the past 52 weeks. Still, it could be an intriguing contrarian idea among top-rated tech stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Pre-Earnings Power Plays: 7 Stocks to Buy Before They Report Next Week",
        "content": "This earnings season promises to be an interesting one. A lot is hinging on upcoming earnings, considering company reports set the stage for 2024 while acting as an official close to 2023’s holiday shopping season. For that reason – shopping season uncertainty – retail stocks are ones to avoid this earnings season if you’re even slightly risk-averse. Even a hint of poor holiday performance could send solid retail stocks into a tailspin, as we saw with Target’s (NYSE:TGT) disastrous 2022 earnings.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean there aren’t a handful of worthy stocks to buy before earnings. If you’re looking to tilt the odds in your favor, find stocks with strong tailwinds that capitalize on current market and economic forces. Better yet, focus on a few core sectors displaying outsized strength: niche financials (not banks, yet), nuts-and-bolts tech (not SaaS), and healthcare (a perennial favorite as the best companies break free from the post-pandemic slump).\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG)\n\nEarnings Date: Tuesday, January 23rd – After Hours\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a bit of a unique earnings play, considering the company posted preliminary results earlier last week. Shares popped 10% on the heels of the preliminary report’s strength – so the downside to adding ISRG to a list of stocks to buy before earnings is that some of the good news is already baked in.\n\nThe upside? ISRG’s stellar preliminary report points to continued dominance for the robotics and automation company, making it a HealthTech stock worth holding forever, even if next week’s actual earnings report doesn’t send shares much higher.\n\nIn its preliminary report, ISRG’s 4th quarter revenue climbed 17% year-over-year (YoY) to $1.93 billion, with projected annual revenue hitting a 14% YoY jump to $7.12 billion. Better yet, ISRG’s top-line growth is more than just increasing product pricing; its innovative da Vinci surgical platform saw robotic tech procedures increase 22% globally, with more expansion on the horizon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few caveats to ISRG’s prospects moving forward, though – and both center on China. The preliminary report indicates that a COVID-19 resurgence in the region had greater effects on ISRG’s planned procedure rate than expected as hospitals cut down on non-emergent surgery. This points to a continued COVID-19 threat for medical stocks, especially in regions like China that adhere to an FFTIS-centric approach.\n\nBut, more concerning for ISRG’s long-term strength is China’s increased pivot towards homegrown surgical robotics rather than continued reliance on da Vinci. This cuts into ISRG’s regional market share but could threaten the company globally if China expands its healthcare automation footprint abroad.\n\nStocks to Buy Before Earnings: DR Horton (DHI)\n\nEarnings Date: Tuesday, January 23rd – Pre-Market In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a series of dips, “new starts” in residential housing are climbing back to pre-pandemic levels, though still a hair below what we saw amid the pandemic’s ZIRP-mania. DR Horton’s (NYSE:DHI) upcoming earnings could prove the housing market has reached stability, inspiring investor confidence and potentially sending shares soaring.\n\nThe residential builder’s stock had a banger 2023, with shares climbing more than 60% even amid economic clampdown and slightly slowed housing starts. It’s important to note that because of nuances in revenue recognition, homebuilder earnings reports tend to lag slightly. So, for example, financial figures within a Q4 earnings report are sometimes more reflective of what actually happened in Q2 or Q3 the same year.\n\nThat latency is why other metrics are just as important to gauge homebuilder viability, and DHI is meeting the mark in that respect. Cancellations (buyers pulling out of a new home contract before closing) are one of those metrics that also serve as an overall economic bellwether. While cancellations are still fairly high, DHI reported that the overall rate fell from 32% to 21% in its most recent calculation. At the same time, DHI is making lemonade out of canceled contract lemons by getting into the long-term rental game with its inventory – and that business segment brought $217.2 million worth of profit into the company’s coffers in its last financial filing.\n\nFair Isaac Corp (FICO)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, January 26th – Time TBD Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks.\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nCredit-scoring monolith Fair Isaac Corp (NYSE:FICO) is on a run of its own, and its upcoming earnings could easily inflate the company’s stock, which has already climbed nearly 100% over the past year. As the credit crunch continues, of course, FICO’s credit-scoring services are increasingly in demand. That’s why FICO remains the gold standard of credit scoring, with 95% of all asset-backed securitizations using FICO scores as a core metric to vet and judge risk.\n\nBut lest you assume FICO’s national dominance marks the top for the company’s position in a saturated market, FICO is running the global game to open new income avenues. Late last year, FICO broke into India with a handful of banks adopting the FICO platform’s AI and automation opportunities to increase loan origination and streamline their lending processes. As India stands as one of the fastest-growing emerging markets economically, there’s an increased need for borrowing to fuel local business growth. And FICO tapped that market just in time. Investors should keep their ears open during the earnings call to see what management says about the state of FICO’s global operations – because that segment is what could send the company into the next growth tier.\n\nStocks to Buy Before Earnings: American Express (AXP)\n\nEarnings Date: Friday, January 26th – Pre-Market an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBetting on broad financial stocks during this earnings season is tough but, if you have to pick one, American Express (NYSE:AXP) is the easy answer. Compared to peers like Citigroup (NYSE:C), which fired thousands of workers just before Christmas, AXP is having a top-tier year as its net income climbed 30% in its last earnings report. The question of course, is whether AXP can continue the momentum next week on the heels of a questionable holiday shopping season.\n\nEarly signs point to yes. The previous quarter marked the company’s sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue, and even a modest sales season could maintain the credit spending trend. More importantly, unlike the retail stocks I referenced above, AXP is agnostic to any specific company performance and, instead, rides on the wave of overall consumer spending. And, after falling in 2023’s first quarter, credit card utilization rates ticked back up towards the end of the year. Combined with (slightly) rosier overall economic prospects, this indicates renewed consumer confidence more than over-leveraged households struggling to stay afloat.\n\nThat perspective is further evidenced by credit card delinquencies flatlining, which, in the words of one analyst, is “a sign we could be approaching peak normalization.” That statement came back in November, and if trends hold, we should see seasonality return to credit card borrowing – just in time for holiday shopping (and AXP’s earnings report next week).\n\nLogitech International (LOGI)\n\nEarnings Date: Monday, January 22nd – After Hours logitech (LOGI) logo behind a desk with laptops on it\n\nSource: Ismail Sadiron / Shutterstock.com\n\nLogitech International (NASDAQ:LOGI) struggled more than most hardware tech companies in the past year, but its Q3 earnings pointed to renewed strength that, if the renewed consumer sentiment thesis holds, could maintain momentum in next week’s earnings report. Last October’s earnings marked a reversal as the company posted its first earnings increase after eight consecutive declining quarters.\n\nAnalysts tend to be cool toward LOGI, with most recommending investors Hold and pinning the current price as slightly overvalued. Still, some of the biggest names in the business – including Barclays and JP Morgan – rate LOGI as a Buy and rate the current per-share pricing at or slightly below fair value. These factors combine to make Logitech somewhat of a dark horse earnings play, but there’s more upside than downside in this case. If the company’s earnings fall flat, then it stands broadly in line with expectations (barring any catastrophic news). But if LOGI closes another profitable quarter, then shares could surge on the beat.\n\nStocks to Buy Before Earnings: Texas Instruments (TXN)\n\nEarnings Date: Tuesday, January 23rd – After Hours Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductors remain a hot commodity, but among all the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hype, homegrown chipmaker Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) went largely unacknowledged in recent years. That could change, though, as the company’s rapid inroads into automotive chipmaking represent a major inflection point for the stock that offers an upside for its upcoming earnings report.\n\nNotably, rather than focusing on high-end chips, TXN focuses on low-end analog and embedded chips. While this might seem counterintuitive to growth prospects, the emphasis on this sector protects TXN from wider competition – particularly ongoing battles between Chinese companies battling high-end chipmakers like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). There’s value in keeping things low-key as others fight for dominance in saturated, sophisticated markets, and TXN has that segment locked down.\n\nBetter yet, TXN’s focused on process improvements in recent months rather than pure cost-cutting, which could have downstream effects that include production cost reductions as high as 40%. Ultimately, TXN is an “old reliable” that might not post stellar earnings but still maintains strength and stability that keeps your portfolio afloat amid wider volatility.\n\nTeledyne Technologies (TDY)\n\nEarnings Date: Wednesday, January 24th – Time TBD The logo for Teledyne (TDY) is seen on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want a cast a wide net, conglomerate Teledyne Technologies (NYSE:TDY) is the earnings play for you. The company owns and operates dozens of companies across instrumentation, imaging, aerospace, defense, and engineering sectors. In fact, the company’s products are so widespread that they boast the company “enables many of the products and services you use every day.” Better yet, each of its segments is firmly within a defensive (from a stock perspective) industry less affected by economic volatility than others.\n\nIn its last report, the company posted a solid earnings beat of $5.05 per share compared to analyst expectations of around $4.75 per share. Over the past five years, TDY marked a 14% compound earnings per share growth, and there’s little indication the upcoming earnings report will deviate from the trend.\n\nOne capital management firm summed up TDY’s bull thesis well, saying the company offers “Highly engineered, premium priced, critical technologies sold across a diverse range of end markets.” Likewise, the report pointed to TDY’s strong free cash flow and improved balance sheet as indications its current per-share pricing remains undervalued. Other analysts widely agree, with 71% of polled responders calling the stock a Buy before next week’s earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "By Chibuike Oguh\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices jumped on Tuesday as investor optimism over the prospects of higher demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chips prompted Wall Street analysts to hike their price targets for the semiconductor giants.\n\nNvidia currently has a dominant position in the market for advanced AI chips, but AMD is expected to gain ground this year as the company increases deliveries of its own chips to enterprise customers, Barclays analysts led by Tom O'Malley said in an investor note.\n\nNvidia's stock rose 3.4% to $565.60 and hit a new record high, while shares of AMD surged 8.2% to $158.64, rising to their highest level in more than two years. The value of Nvidia's shares more than tripled last year, making it the world's most valuable chipmaker, while those of AMD more than doubled.\n\nBarclays raised its price target for AMD shares to $200 from $120, while KeyBanc analysts raised theirs to $195 from $170.

        "content": "(Reuters) -Applied Digital lowered its full-year expectations on Tuesday, blaming a tight supply of sought-after networking components made by chipmaker Nvidia, sending shares of the data center service provider plunging nearly 23%.\n\nThe company is grappling with delayed deliveries of some parts, including Nvidia's InfiniBand, which works like an ethernet cable, linking clusters of chips across servers.\n\nInfiniBand enables AI computing. Demand for Nvidia's AI chips and accompanying tech has far outweighed supply as companies rush to adopt generative AI.\n\nWhile Applied Digital did not flag any issues with AI chip supply on its earnings call, it said it has pushed back deliveries of Nvidia graphic processing units (GPUs) due to the InfiniBand bottlenecks.\n\n\"We could have taken a significant number of GPUs in December, but there's no reason to do that,\" the company said, adding it would be \"detrimental\" to take deliveries.\n\nBut Applied Digital said it has seen an improvement in deliveries of the networking equipment in recent weeks, a sign the issue could be easing.\n\nThe company now expects 2024 total revenue to come in below its prior range of $385 million to $405 million.\n\nIt also expects annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to be below its previous forecast range of $195 million to $205 million.\n\nApplied Digital did not disclose its revised full-year projections for the metrics.\n\nThe company also missed estimates for second-quarter revenue.

        "title": "7 AR Stocks to Bet On Ahead of Apple’s Vision Pro Release",
        "content": "Over the last few years, investors have become increasingly interested in the idea of virtual reality (VR), or augmented reality (AR), as a broad opportunity. The emergence of the metaverse during the pandemic served to heat up conversation around the topic. And the apparent opportunity has only become clearer as the technology has developed. With this, AR stocks are on the rise.\n\nWith an expected CAGR above 24% between 2024 and 2029, the virtual reality market and stocks therein are very attractive. There’s also more immediate news that will inspire investors in the coming weeks – Apple is set to release its Vision Pro in early February. Its release will prompt greater interest in the sector overall and is a great reason for investors to consider directing money into these firms at the moment.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nThe News that Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro will be on store shelves on Feb. 2 makes it the most important stock in this conversation. The Vision Pro won’t contribute much to Apple’s fundamentals in the near term but that doesn’t mean it won’t serve to propel its shares higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe simple truth is that despite the Vision Pro’s high price of $3,499, sales aren’t expected to be particularly significant. Recent estimates suggest that Apple could sell about 1 million of the headsets in 2024. That means the company will only see a few billion dollars extra in revenues from The Vision Pro at best. Frankly, that doesn’t move the needle much for Apple due to its massive size.\n\nSo, why then should investors assume that the release of the Vision Pro will positively affect Apple’s share price? The most obvious answer is that sales could dramatically increase in the next few years, for one. In time, the Vision Pro could contribute significantly to Apple’s fundamental growth. And two, Apple has an incredibly strong track record of impactful product releases that tend to do very well.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) As Free Cash Flow Continues Rolling, So Will Facebook Stock\n\nSource: fyv6561 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has long been one of the leading names in the development of the virtual reality space. The company then known as Facebook acquired AR firm Oculus in 2014. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long been a strong proponent of virtual reality dating back beyond the metaverse branding pivot in 2021.\n\nBack in 2017 Zuckerberg announced at the Oculus Connect conference that he wanted to get 1 billion people in virtual reality. That was a bold assertion at the time given that the company had only sold roughly 1 million VR headsets at that point.\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg has not slowed down which was made all the more clear by the company’s brand pivot and renaming to Meta Platforms in late 2021. Fast forward a few years, and the company had sold more than 20 million VR headsets through early 2023.\n\nObviously 20 million is well short of 1 billion, but Meta Platforms is well positioned to chase that goal moving forward. Apple’s early February release of the Vision Pro 2 will rekindle interest in Meta Platforms as it chases that goal.\n\nUniversal Display Corporation (OLED) OLED screen representing OLED stock\n\nSource: Daniel Pieterson / Shutterstock.com\n\nUniversal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) supplies organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) that are critical to the manufacturer of VR/AR headsets. All kinds of companies including Sony (NYSE:SONY) and Apple use OLED in their headsets, making Universal Display Corporation an interesting stock to consider.\n\nInvestors should also note that Universal Display Corporation is positively regarded on Wall Street. Its shares currently benefit from an overall ‘buy’ rating and moved up from a lower ‘overweight’ rating just a month ago. The high target price among the 12 analysts with coverage suggests that OLED shares could rise by 50% in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nInformation regarding some of the company’s more than 5,500 current patents can be found here. The overall thrust, though, is clear – Universal Display Corporation is well positioned to benefit from licensing opportunities as the virtual reality space continues to develop. Companies like Sony and Apple will continue to purchase the rights to that technology. That truth is all the more pertinent as Apple gears up to release the Vision Pro in the coming weeks.\n\nUnity Software (U) The Unity Software website is displayed on a laptop screen. U stock\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) will continue to be an interesting stock to consider in the VR space for one simple fact: graphics are incredibly important to the success or failure of the entire sector. The company has developed software that allows developers to create the 3D images used throughout them. If those images are subpar, disaster is not far away.\n\nFor example, remember when Mark Zuckerberg and Meta Platforms first released their demos of the Metaverse? The graphics were downright childish and led to wide derision of the company’s Metaverse pivot. It wasn’t the end and that demo also did not fully represent the firm’s graphical capability. However, it does reinforce the idea that quality graphics are vitally important throughout the industry.\n\nMore to the point, Apple and Unity Software are already partners. The release of the Vision Pro in early February should serve to redirect investors again toward Unity software and its shares.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Unity Software, is a very important stock to consider in virtual reality in relation to the importance of graphics. Nvidia’s GPUs are known to be the very best and benefit from wide application in gaming consoles and PCs.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is that the world of virtual reality/mixed reality/augmented reality requires even better graphical capabilities. Users demand strong graphics first and foremost whereas graphics are less important in platform gaming. Nvidia has created a developer tool kit which is geared toward virtual reality.\n\nIn short, Nvidia’s graphical prowess is very well known at this point. The company clearly has a strong opportunity in the continued development of the virtual reality space and a highly established name overall. Its chips continue to be in high demand for multiple applications including virtual reality.\n\nFurther, Nvidia obviously has and will continue to have a massive opportunity in relation to artificial intelligence. Thus, its shares expose investors to multiple paths toward continued strong growth overall.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the largest tech companies in existence. Silicon Valley firms have a presence across almost any given area of technology. Thus, it shouldn’t surprise readers to understand that the company has a significant role in the development of virtual reality. MSFT stock is strong for many reasons with the VR opportunity serving to further bolster investor confidence.\n\nThat statement might seem a bit contradictory given recent news around Microsoft’s Windows VR headsets. The company announced in December that it was discontinuing those headsets, which have thus far been slower sellers relative to those of competitors throughout Silicon Valley.\n\nIt’s difficult to believe that Microsoft will scrap the project on a wholesale scale. The company’s HoloLens 2 has a wide enterprise level application. firms are using it to enhance productivity and capability in workplace situations. Despite some clear setbacks to date, anticipate that Microsoft will figure out a way to make money from future continued development of virtual reality. The company has shown a continued investment in the artificial intelligence space which only makes that possibility greater.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Is another firm that has a wide footprint across the technology sector. Like Microsoft, Qualcomm is a very well established player in Silicon Valley. Both stocks are very stable overall and are strong choices for investors looking to gain exposure to VR without substantial risk.\n\nLet’s begin with looking at the reasons to consider Qualcomm for the short to medium term. Most importantly, Qualcomm recently extended its contract with Apple through 2026. That contract provides Qualcomm with a lot of stability that eases prior concerns. As much as Apple would like to bring more of its chip production in house, it simply isn’t as easy as wishing it to be. Qualcomm continues to provide technology that Apple is incapable of replicating. The long and short of that truth is that Qualcomm will continue to be a steady stock in the coming years.\n\nIn short, Qualcomm is a very stable stock. That notion is reinforced by the fact that the company pays a dividend yielding roughly 2.3% last reduced more than two decades ago.\n\nAll of that said, Qualcomm is leveraging its well regarded Snapdragon chips for the development of virtual reality. Further, the company has developed its own virtual reality/augmented reality glasses. Qualcomm continues to be a strong stable stock overall and one that should benefit from increased interest following the release of the Vision Pro headset.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "If You'd Invest $350,000 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends",
        "content": "A group of technology giants dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" was responsible for a large proportion of the 26.3% gain in the S&P 500 last year. That's because their collective valuation of $12 trillion makes up 28% of the index, so they have a huge influence over the direction of the broader market.\n\nThese are the Magnificent Seven stocks, and how they performed in 2023: NVDA Total Return Price Chart\n\nThe Equal Weight S&P 500 index -- which assigns an identical weighting to all 500 stocks -- finished 2023 with a gain of just 11.5%. It highlights just how impactful the surging Magnificent Seven returns were on the actual S&P 500. If you didn't own that group of stocks last year, your portfolio probably lagged the market.\n\nBut it's not all about blockbuster gains, because some of the Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. I'm going to show you how much you could earn with a $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence, cloud computing, electric vehicles, and more\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies operate across every major segment of the technology sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the largest driver of value in 2023, which is why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the group higher. Its H100 and upcoming H200 data center chips are designed to process AI workloads, and demand continues to surge as more businesses seek to develop AI applications.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are some of the world's largest data center operators, and therefore some of Nvidia's biggest customers. They use those centralized data centers to deliver cloud services -- and the computing power necessary to develop AI -- to millions of businesses around the world. Plus, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet offer cloud customers a growing number of large language models (LLMs), which are the building blocks of many AI applications.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using AI to show more relevant content to each of its 3.1 billion monthly users. The company also created an LLM of its own called Llama, which is open source, so any developer can use it to build advanced AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) created its own LLM in-house, which it's using to develop an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT. It will pair nicely with the company's latest iPhone 15, because it's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads on-device. This will place AI at the fingertips of billions of people around the world.\n\nFinally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the world's leading electric vehicle company by sales up until the end of 2023, when it was edged out by China-based BYD. However, Tesla's future will likely be determined by the success of its AI-powered autonomous self-driving vehicle technology. It's yet to be publicly released, but it has the potential to transform the company's economics. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThree of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay dividends\n\nSome companies generate so much profit they can't possibly reinvest it all into their operations to fuel more growth, so they pay some of it to shareholders instead. Dividends are the most common form of distribution, and they usually come as quarterly cash payments.\n\nApple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that pay dividends. Each of them less than a 1% yield, which are the payouts investors can expect to receive annually, calculated based on the value of their holdings. MSFT Dividend Yield Chart\n\nYields often change. If a stock doubles, its yield will halve organically unless the company raises its dividend. It doesn't mean the payout shrinks in dollar terms, but it falls as a percentage of the value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers the highest yield, and while it seems small at face value, it translates to around $20 billion in dividend payments each year based on its current market capitalization of $2.8 trillion.\n\nIf you'd invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock) you would earn a dividend yield of 0.37% on $150,000, and no yield on the other $200,000. That translates to an effective yield of 0.18% on the $350,000, or an annual payment of $659.56.\n\nIt's a paltry sum given the yield investors can earn on cash in a savings account right now, but it's a nice bonus on top of the spectacular capital growth these stocks have delivered over the past year.\n\nDividends aren't the only form of distribution\n\nA dividend isn't the only way companies return money to shareholders. They can also execute stock buyback programs, where they purchase their own shares on the open market. Those shrink the number of available shares in circulation, which leads to a higher price per share.\n\nStock buybacks are preferable to dividends for many companies, because they give them the flexibility to distribute the money at a time of their choosing -- they aren't locked into paying out a specified sum each quarter.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven companies have active share repurchase programs, worth a combined $186.6 billion over the last 12 months. Tesla and Amazon are the two without active programs. AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nAre the Magnificent Seven stocks still a buy now?\n\nAs I touched on at the top, investors who didn't own the Magnificent Seven stocks in 2023 likely underperformed the S&P 500 index. The law of large numbers makes it somewhat counterintuitive to expect these enormous companies to continue delivering the best returns in the entire market, because it gets harder for them to grow their revenue and earnings each year.\n\nHowever, it so happens that the Magnificent Seven companies operate at the forefront of the fastest growing industries in the world. For any investor seeking exposure to technologies like AI, cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, or electric vehicles, it's nearly impossible to look past these stocks.\n\nDepending on which Wall Street forecast you rely on, AI alone could add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade. Each of the Magnificent Seven already has a foothold in the industry, and they will likely deploy their considerable financial resources to ensure they capture a large slice of the opportunity.\n\nTherefore, the Magnificent Seven will likely be a great place for investors to park their money for the long term, and any dividends earned are an added bonus.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "content": "Historically, the U.S. stock market is an excellent means of creating generational wealth, especially for long-term investors who hold on to their winning investments despite short-term noise. For example, $1,000 invested in the S&P 500 in 1950 would have grown to over $2.6 million by 2023, despite the multiple boom and bust cycles.\n\nHowever, to benefit from the stock market's power of compounding, it is also essential for investors to choose high-quality stocks with strong fundamentals and robust growth prospects. Here's why Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) fit the bill and can prove to be smart long-term buys now.\n\nNvidia\n\nPreviously famous for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and advanced gaming hardware, Nvidia is now better known for its indisputable leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Consumer internet companies, cloud service providers, and enterprises have been increasingly using Nvidia's GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), networking technologies, and AI-optimized software solutions to build the infrastructure needed for running power-hungry and complex generative AI applications.\n\nNvidia expects even more demand for its chips from sovereign AI cloud and regional AI cloud providers, as data and application security have become a priority for governments across the world. Enterprises such as Snowflake, ServiceNow, Adobe, and Databricks are increasingly integrating AI copilots and assistants in their platforms. Many companies across various industries are also building customized AI applications. The increasing adoption of AI by enterprises is driving up demand for Nvidia's accelerated computing solutions. Not surprisingly, Citi analyst Christopher Danely expects the company to account for at least a 90% share of the AI chip market in future years.\n\nBesides AI hardware, Nvidia is also making major strides in its software business. The company expects to end fiscal 2024 (ending Jan. 31, 2024) with an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for recurring software, support, and services offerings. Nvidia has also pointed out DGX Cloud service and AI Enterprise software as two major growth opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia licenses its DGX Cloud service (which gives access to AI models, software, security services, researchers, and engineers) to enterprise customers to enable them to build customized generative AI applications. DGX Cloud service is also integrated with Nvidia's AI enterprise software (enterprise-grade software suite optimized for AI workloads and closely integrated with Nvidia hardware).\n\nAll these initiatives have translated into solid financial success for Nvidia. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported a 206% year-over-year revenue increase, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 6 times more on a year-over-year basis. Analysts are also expecting the company's revenue to grow 232% year over year to $20.1 billion and earnings per share to grow by 411% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global AI market is estimated to grow from $515.3 billion in 2023 to just over $2 trillion in 2030. Considering Nvidia's dominance in the rapidly growing AI market and its annual run rate of just $44.9 billion, there is still much scope for growth in the coming years.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAfter a difficult 2022, social media giant Meta Platforms' share prices rose nearly 185% in 2023. However, the stock's upward trajectory may not be yet over and there are still many reasons to like this company.\n\nFirst, Meta Platforms owns and operates multiple social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, which together command nearly 3.96 billion monthly active users. With the company's user base accounting for more than 40% of the global population, Meta's platforms have become indispensable for the majority of advertisers.\n\nSecond, Meta is witnessing an acceleration in advertising revenue across multiple geographic segments. Increasing spending from Chinese advertisers targeting international markets and rising advertising demand in South Asian markets emerged as major growth drivers.\n\nThird, Meta has introduced new generative AI-powered advertising features such as text variations, image expansion, and background generation. These tools have been included in the Advantage+ solutions catalogue to make it easier for advertisers to create impactful advertisements. The Advantage+ shopping campaigns have already reached a $10 billion run rate, while over half of the company's advertisers are also using these tools.\n\nFourth, Meta has also managed to increase user engagement with AI-driven feed recommendations on Facebook and Instagram. In the third quarter, AI-driven recommendations resulted in a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, and a 6% increase in time spent on Instagram.\n\nBusiness messaging is also growing on Meta's platforms. With 600 million conversations between people and businesses daily, click-to-message advertising can prove to be a big opportunity for the company.\n\nFinally, Meta is also investing in new data center architecture to improve cost efficiencies and increase planning flexibility for new GPU and CPU capacity.\n\nAll these tailwinds have made Meta a compelling pick for 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Workplace culture doesn't get a lot of attention among stock market investors, but it's among the biggest determinants of success, and it's one of the most important jobs of a CEO.\n\nCultural values at a company don't show up on the bottom line or in financial statements, but they make a very real difference in a company's performance. Happy employees reach or exceed their potential, compared to unhappy ones, who languish and breed toxicity. They also act as ambassadors for the company, effectively recruiting future employees by telling people that their company is a great place to work.\n\nSatisfied employees also lead to lower turnover, which saves companies money on recruiting and training and helps maintain the culture, creating a shared corporate memory. Similarly, teams that work well together come up with better ideas, do better work, and finish projects faster, and the building blocks of any company are ultimately a group of people and their ideas. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's secret strength\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the belle of the artificial intelligence (AI) ball thus far. Its revenue and profits skyrocketed over the last year as its AI components have been in high demand. Competitors, meanwhile, have yet to introduce a product that can match Nvidia's AI accelerators and run the massive models used to train AI programs like ChatGPT.\n\nFor followers of the company, it might not come as a surprise then that Nvidia's culture is just as strong as its business.\n\nThe AI stock was just named the No. 2 place to work by Glassdoor, the employment review website, with a rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars. Only Bain & Company, a consulting firm, ranked higher.\n\nNot only does Nvidia rank second-highest of any company on Glassdoor, but 94% of respondents said that they would recommend the company to a friend, and a whopping 98% of the survey participants said they approve of the CEO, Jensen Huang. Nvidia isn't a stranger to the list of top places to work -- this is the fourth year that the company has been ranked in the top five.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of those high ratings might reflect the company's recent success as Nvidia employees are among the biggest beneficiaries of the stock's meteoric surge and a number of them mentioned restricted stock units in their posts, but there's more to the culture than just success and high compensation.\n\nHow Nvidia's culture separates it from the competition\n\nMany of Nvidia's employees comment on its flat hierarchical structure and its team-oriented business structure.\n\nThe company itself says on its website:\n\nThere's only one team at Nvidia. That means no politics, no hierarchy. Reporting lines exist, but teams form around projects based on the skills that are required.\n\nAccording to reviewers on sites like Blind, Nvidia's approach is a significant contrast with rival Intel, the legacy chipmaker that is expected to challenge Nvidia in AI.\n\nOne commenter confirmed Nvidia's cultural objective above, saying there was \"less hierarchy and way less politics\" at Nvidia compared to Intel. They also described groups \"actively trying to kill other groups' proposals\" and called it a \"very toxic environment.\" Others said the work-life balance was better at Nvidia. Morale also seems to be significantly at higher at Nvidia, though it's worth noting that Intel's ratings on Glassdoor were still generally high, at 4.1 stars. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuccess breeds success\n\nInternally, the biggest risk at a company like Nvidia that has had so much success is that employees can get complacent. Microsoft, for example, developed a reputation for having something of a country club culture in the early 2000s.\n\nHowever, Nvidia seems unlikely to fall into that trap as the company just announced a slew of new chips and partnerships at the CES trade show last week, delighting Wall Street and sending the stock soaring on the news.\n\nWhile competition should eventually narrow the performance gap and fill the shortages we've seen for AI components, the AI crown is Nvidia's to lose, and it's unlikely to loosen its grip soon.\n\nIts winning culture is a big reason why.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "The Once High-Flying Stock-Split Stock to Avoid Like the Plague in 2024",
        "content": "Investing on Wall Street has been akin to riding a roller coaster since this decade began. Over the past four years, the major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.\n\nWhen volatility rules the roost on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to pile into time-tested outperformers. While the FAANG stocks have certainly fit the bill for the past decade, it's companies enacting stock splits that have been investors' preference over the past couple of years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude, without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Stock splits can be used to make shares of a company more nominally affordable for everyday investors (a forward-stock split), or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (a reverse-stock split).\n\nInvestors have flocked to high-profile stock-split stocks for more than two years\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, nine high-flying companies have conducted forward-stock splits, including semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), internet search behemoth Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and e-commerce kingpin Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which effected respective splits of 4-for-1, 20-for-1, and 20-for-1.\n\nAlthough the act of splitting their respective shares is a very short-term catalyst driven by investor emotions, forward-stock splits more importantly act as a beacon for businesses that are out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nFor example, Nvidia has gone on to become the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution since conducting its split in July 2021. The company's A100 and H100 AI-inspired graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a greater than 90% share of GPUs in use by high-compute data centers this year. While Nvidia's stock would probably be soaring with or without its stock split in July 2021, its previous split has made shares more affordable for investors without access to fractional-share purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock splits have also served as a reminder of just how impressive Alphabet's and Amazon's respective moats are. Alphabet's Google tallied a nearly 92% share of global internet search in December, which is 88 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor. Google Cloud has also gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure services spending.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon brought in approximately 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022, per Insider Intelligence, and it's the leading provider of global cloud infrastructure services via Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS sports an annual sales run rate of $92 billion and is currently responsible for the lion's share of Amazon's operating income.\n\nLong story short, it's very easy to see why investors have flocked to high-profile stock-split stocks in recent years. Just keep in mind that not all stock-split stocks are worth investing in. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis ultra-popular stock-split stock is worth avoiding in 2024\n\nWhereas forward-stock splits are almost always conducted by top-notch companies, reverse-stock splits are, more often than not, a sign of trouble. Though there have been a few instances throughout history of reverse-stock splits working out nicely for long-term investors, such as tech-based travel company Booking Holdings, reverse splits are usually situations to avoid.\n\nFor once-high-flying marijuana stock Canopy Growth(NASDAQ: CGC), its recent split is all the more reason to keep your distance in 2024. Effective Dec. 20, 2023, the company completed a 1-for-10 reverse split. Had this split not taken place, Canopy's common stock would be trading for about $0.45 per share, which is more than 99% below its all-time high.\n\nAt one time, the Canadian pot industry appeared primed for success. When our neighbors to the north gave recreational weed the green light to be legally sold in October 2018, it was widely expected that vertically integrated licensed producers would thrive. In particular, Canopy Growth was expected to benefit from international exports and a domestic surge in demand for higher-margin cannabis derivatives (e.g., edibles, beverages, and vapes).\n\nUnfortunately, reality never came close to matching these expectations. Part of the blame does lie with Canadian regulators. Federal regulators were incredibly slow to approve cultivation licenses prior to October 2018, while provincial regulators in Ontario (Canada's largest province by population) initially relied on a lottery system to award dispensary licenses. This lottery system resulted in far too few retail locations opening in a key province.\n\nConsumer behavior didn't quite align with projections for Canadian cannabis companies, either. Cannabis users have gravitated toward value-based products and dried cannabis flower. In other words, margins for Canadian licensed producers are far below what was expected.\n\nBut let's not beat around the cannabis bush -- Canopy Growth deserves more than its fair share of the blame, too. Management grossly overestimated domestic and global production needs, which is one reason the company took a goodwill impairment charge of more than $1.4 billion in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2023).\n\nFurthermore, during the early stages of the marijuana craze, Canopy Growth's stock-based compensation was exorbitantly high. Even after hiring David Klein in 2020 from Constellation Brands to tighten Canopy Growth's proverbial belt, the company still hasn't been able to back its way into the profit column. CGC Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nA history of poor acquisitions, coupled with grossly overexpanding production capacity without understanding consumer demand trends, has decimated the company's once-robust cash pile. Since closing a roughly $4 billion equity investment from Constellation Brands in November 2018, Canopy Growth's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments have shrunk to around $201 million, as of Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nAlthough Canopy Growth has raised some cash by issuing stock and conducting private placements, the company's auditors have included a going concern warning in its operating results. This means Canopy may not have the capital to cover its expected operating liabilities over the next 12 months.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for Canopy Growth is that there's no guarantee the U.S. federal government will change marijuana's scheduling anytime soon. President Joe Biden has signaled no willingness to legalize cannabis for recreational purposes, and multiple attempts to enact banking reform measures have been stymied in the U.S. Senate. Without the ability to enter the most lucrative cannabis market in the world, Canopy Growth stock likely has further to fall.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Canopy Growth right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Canopy Growth, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Canopy Growth wasn't one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 1 Magnificent Growth Stock to Buy Before It Joins the $2 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index was in roaring form last year as it gained nearly 54% thanks to a variety of tailwinds, including the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), cooling inflation, and a resilient economy. And the good part is that the index could keep heading higher in 2024.\n\nHistorical data collected by fintech brokerage firm Capex.com suggests that a year in which the Nasdaq-100 clocks a gain of more than 40% is followed by another year of gains -- barring 1999, when the dot-com bubble was about to burst. These trends indicate that the Nasdaq-100 could jump 24% this year from 2023 levels.\n\nWall Street is also positive about the Nasdaq-100's prospects, predicting that the index could land between 17,000 and 18,500 this year. Using the higher end of the estimate, that would be a 10% jump from current levels. While past performance is definitely not an indicator of how the market could perform in the future, tailwinds such as a potential cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve could send the Nasdaq-100 even higher.\n\nThat's why now would be a good time to take a look at Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a chipmaker that saw major growth thanks to the booming demand for its AI chips. The stock has had a terrific start in 2024 with gains of more than 10% already, and it probably won't be long before this semiconductor stock hits a $2 trillion market cap. Let's see why.\n\nA $2 trillion market cap isn't too far away for Nvidia\n\nThe stock's AI-fueled surge in the past year has brought the company's market cap to $1.35 trillion, making it the world's sixth-largest company. This means Nvidia needs to jump another 48% from current levels to enter the $2 trillion club. There is a strong chance it could achieve that mark sooner rather than later given how fast its earnings are growing.\n\nNvidia is expected to finish its fiscal 2024 (which will end this month) with $12.25 in earnings per share (EPS), a big jump from the $3.34 in fiscal 2023. And as the following chart suggests, EPS could jump another 63% in the new fiscal year, beginning next month.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nNvidia currently has a forward earnings multiple of 55, higher than its five-year average of 42. Assuming it trades at a discounted 42 times after a year, in line with the five-year average, and hits Wall Street's estimated earnings target, its stock price could jump to $835. That would be a 52% jump from current levels.\n\nSo, the possibility of Nvidia hitting $2 trillion in market cap over the next year or so cannot be ruled out thanks to a collection of tailwinds.\n\nMultiple growth drivers should help this chip stock sustain its bull run\n\nShares are up an impressive 223% in the past year as the company's data center business has taken off with the robust demand for its AI chips. The good news is that Nvidia is set to benefit from more growth drivers in the coming year, along with AI, which could supercharge the company's earnings.\n\nFor example, the gaming market seems all set to move the needle in a bigger way for Nvidia thanks to the growth in the personal computer (PC) market, as well as the adoption of AI-enabled PCs. The company's gaming revenue was up 81% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Oct. 29) to $2.86 billion.\n\nThe trend is likely to continue as PC sales are expected to rebound 8% in 2024 from a decline of 12.4% last year, according to technology market analyst Canalys.\n\nAnother catalyst for Nvidia's PC business is that a big chunk of gamers are expected to upgrade their systems this year. According to a survey of 1,000 PC builders conducted by DFC Intelligence, 53% of respondents who built their PCs in 2020 plan to upgrade or build a new PC within the next year, while 84% are likely to upgrade within the next couple of years.\n\nThese tailwinds should ideally lead to higher demand for Nvidia's gaming GPUs (graphics processing units). Jon Peddie Research says that the shipments of discrete GPUs, which are used for gaming, increased 37% sequentially in the third quarter of 2023, indicating that this market is already in turnaround mode. Considering Nvidia's 80% share of the discrete GPU market, the company is in a position to capitalize on this turnaround.\n\nMeanwhile, the growing adoption of digital twins (virtual models of real-life objects) could turn out to be another catalyst for Nvidia in 2024. This market is expected to clock annual growth of 30% through 2027 as more and more manufacturers are forecast to adopt this technology to improve their operations. The company is already benefiting from this trend as major organizations have started deploying its digital-twin solutions. Given that this market could hit an estimated $92 billion in 2029, it could have a huge impact on Nvidia's business in the long run.\n\nConsidering that Nvidia enjoys terrific pricing power and market share in the fast-growing market for AI chips, there are several reasons why the company is on track for outstanding growth over the next year, and beyond.\n\nAll this indicates that investors would do well to buy Nvidia before the Nasdaq-100 heads higher in 2024, especially since this AI stock isn't as expensive when compared to the other chipmakers looking to capitalize on this market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "A Look Back at Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks' Q3 Earnings: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Vs The Rest Of The Pack\n\nWrapping up Q3 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the processors and graphics chips stocks, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and its peers.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a solid Q3; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.4% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Inflation (despite slowing) has investors prioritizing near-term cash flows, but processors and graphics chips stocks held their ground better than others, with the share prices up 19.3% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nInventor of the x86 processor that powered decades of technological innovation in PCs, data centers, and numerous other markets, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the leading manufacturer of computer processors and graphics chips.\n\nIntel reported revenues of $14.16 billion, down 7.7% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 4.1%. It was a very good quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' EPS estimates and a significant improvement in its operating margin.

It was a stunning quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin and an impressive beat of analysts' EPS estimates.\n\nStory continues Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is up 9.9% since the results and currently trades at $549.16.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nSlowest Q3: SMART (NASDAQ:SGH)\n\nBased in the US, SMART Global Holdings (NASDAQ:SGH) is a diversified semiconductor company offering memory, digital, and LED products.\n\nSMART reported revenues of $274.2 million, down 41.1% year on year, falling short of analyst expectations by 0.3%. It was a decent quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin but an increase in its inventory levels.\n\nSMART had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The stock is up 10% since the results and currently trades at $20.33.\n\nRead our full analysis of SMART's results here.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nOriginally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.\n\nBroadcom reported revenues of $9.30 billion, up 4.3% year on year, in line with analyst expectations.

        "content": "Step aside, CFOs: New generative AI technology stands to supplant you as your CEO's best friend.\n\nThis in part reflects how the latest crop of powerful tech can unlock major impact to worker productivity and corporate financials, according to a new study of CEOs by consultancy PwC. The survey was released ahead of an AI-themed World Economic Forum kicking off on Tuesday in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nAbout 68% of US CEOs surveyed say that the next 12 months will see generative AI increasing the amount of work that employees can accomplish. That number is 64% globally, according to PwC. Roughly half of US CEOs expect the technology to help them become more productive in their own work.\n\nThe productivity boost should serve up a jolt to profits, CEOs contend.\n\nNearly 44% of the CEOs questioned say they see generative AI providing a net increase in profits in the next 12 months, versus just 3% anticipating a net decrease.\n\n\"Investors are also increasingly demanding executives pursue profitable growth, prompting many CEOs to turn not only to cost containment strategies, but also to GenAI,\" explained PwC. \"What’s alluring about GenAI is its dual ability to produce efficiency gains that hold down current expenses while simultaneously enabling company reinvention. This may mean that, when the macroeconomic headwinds abate, the stage is set for a potentially faster rate of growth on a lower cost basis.\"\n\nPwC adds that 2024 is shaping up to be the year of \"business model reinvention.\"\n\nPrior research from PwC puts a bow on the broader generative AI economic impact.\n\nAI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined.\n\nThe greatest economic gains from generative AI, says PwC, will be in China (an approximate 26% boost to GDP in 2030) and North America (a roughly 14.5% GDP jolt).\n\nTo be sure, investors have been positioning to capture any major upside in profit increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock indexes such as the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) continue to hover around record highs in 2024. Large-cap tech companies with outsized AI exposure such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon remain top picks amongst Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnd the share price of generative AI chip giant — and market darling — Nvidia has pushed to fresh records in 2024's early going.\n\nIn total, Wall Street currently expects S&P 500 profits to grow an impressive 11% in 2024 as new AI tools proliferate and inflation cools. Last year, S&P 500 profits grew about 3% as companies invested aggressively in the first tranche of generative AI and dealt with lingering inflation.\n\n\"The potential rewards from large and transformative impacts of GenAI still outweigh the rising investor expectations implied by solid CY23 stock performance,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance. \"On the balance, we are just getting started.\" Davos 2024\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "If Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell really does reduce interest rates, then forward-looking investors ought to consider blockchain stocks. True, you can always go for the individual cryptocurrencies. However, this arena carries both market and what I would term “administrative” risks. From data breaches to agonizingly forgetting passwords, a lot of stuff can go wrong.\n\nI’m not saying that with blockchain stock picks that nothing can go wrong. Of course, this sector naturally carries high risks. For one thing, the underlying asset class is incredibly volatile and that translates into wildness in the charts. Also, data breaches are not an exclusive problem for crypto traders. That said, since equities trading involves custodial accounts, things like forgotten passwords aren’t really major issues.\n\nOn a much more important note, the Fed could be set to effectively make money cheaper. During prior cycles when interest rates were rising, the incentivization structure favored saving greenbacks. Under declining rates, the structure favors spending (or investing) dollars.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat should be good for cryptos. And what’s good for cryptos is usually positive for blockchain stocks.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nI’m going to ease into this topic of blockchain stocks with names that I can trust. For that, I’m going with IBM (NYSE:IBM). Now, before I get pummeled with emails – the good stuff is coming, I promise! – not too many enterprises related to decentralized transactional platforms (no matter how remotely) pay dividends. IBM does. At the moment, it carries a forward yield of 4%, much higher than the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%.\n\nIf I were to use an (American) football analogy, IBM is to blockchain stock picks what a free safety is to your defensive. It’s just good to know that as a cornerback, there’s somebody behind you that will assist in covering the long ball. And that’s what IBM offers. With its enterprise blockchain solutions and services, it’s not the sexiest way to manifest decentralization. But it gets the job done for high-level functionalities.\n\nStory continues\n\nI must say that are not enthused with Big Blue, rating shares a consensus hold. However, it’s undervalued and underappreciated. Given its myriad other relevancies, it could be a surprise idea among blockchain stocks.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother oddball idea for blockchain stock picks, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) doesn’t seem particularly attractive. For example, Intel only pays a forward dividend yield of 1.06%, which is below the tech sector’s average yield. Also, analysts are not at all enthusiastic about INTC, pegging it a consensus hold. With both Intel and IBM, the average price targets imply downside. What the heck?\n\nFirst, while Intel doesn’t offer a pure-play idea for blockchain stocks (obviously), it does bring relevance to the table. Specifically, its blockchain ASIC solution enables high-performance energy efficient hashing for demanding proof-of-work (PoW) workloads. And before you say that proof of stake (PoS) is becoming the standard mining protocol, it’s also a less-proven directive. From a meritocracy perspective, PoW arguably makes more sense.\n\nSecond, INTC in my opinion will frustrate the bears this year. I say that because institutional traders continue to sell call options. Basically, these short traders are egging on the bulls to take the opposite side of the wager. Well, given the speculative fervor post-pandemic, I’d say they will accept the challenge.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest winners of 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) – which offers graphics processors used in blockchain mining – is a tech juggernaut. In the past 52 weeks, NVDA gained nearly 224% of its equity value. That’s quite a lot, which makes some people think. After all, the trailing-six-month stat comes in at only 19% up. So, is the powerhouse losing gas?\n\nI don’t want to doubt Nvidia, especially since it’s off to an auspicious start in 2024 as well. Further, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy. Among 36 experts, four voices offer a dissenting opinion. But as holds and no sells, short traders would be taking a huge risk going against the grain. Plus, if cryptos soar because of the Fed’s monetary policy pivot, NVDA could once again fly higher.\n\nIt’s almost not fair – some semiconductor companies have all the luck. Last year, it was artificial intelligence. This year, it’s the rise of virtual currencies. Still, you got to respect the mass bullish sentiment. Because of that, NVDA could be one of the blockchain stocks to buy.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow we’re getting into the good stuff, beginning with Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT). Based in Castle Rock, Colorado, Riot Platforms is building the world’s leading benchmark-crypto-driven infrastructure platform. Per its website, digital assets create new value opportunities through the convergence of money and energy. As a result, Riot built massive mining facilities, which admittedly has sparked energy-consumption controversies.\n\nI can see both sides of this issue and I often go back and forth on it. Ultimately, though, the market will find a way to feed demand. And here’s the thing. While we’re on the cusp of a possible monetary policy pivot, we’re also sitting on a demographic goldmine. With members of Generation Z entering into the workforce every year, their purchasing power collectively increases. And what will they invest in?\n\nI believe the answer is obvious. Crypto investing skews young – that’s what every report I’ve seen states. Because Gen Z is the first digital-only generation that lacks awareness of the analog paradigm, it inherently gravitates toward cryptos. That’s probably good news for blockchain stock picks like RIOT.\n\nCipher Mining (CIFR) Concept art of crypto mining with little figuring and a Bitcoin token.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFor another enticing look at blockchain stocks, Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR) could be up your alley. Per its website, Cipher is dedicated to expanding and strengthening the benchmark crypto’s critical infrastructure in the U.S. In this vein, it’s almost identical to Riot Platforms. Notably, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy (among five expert voices). Plus, the price target lands at $5.20, implying almost 60% upside.\n\nIt’s really a toss-up whether you want to go with Cipher or Riot. As far as analyst ratings are concerned, RIOT is a consensus strong buy with a robust (but lower) implied upside potential. However, for speculators, the edge might go to CIFR simply based on the mobility aspect. Riot is more established, featuring a multi-billion-dollar market capitalization. On the other hand, CIFR features a market value of $838 million.\n\nTheoretically, if the stars align in the underlying crypto space, Cipher could yield greater capital gains. Of course, if circumstances go wrong, then CIFR may absorb a greater magnitude of red ink. The choice is yours.\n\nCanaan (CAN) web browser showing Canaan (CAN) logo on website\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Jarretera\n\nFor those that want to ramp up their risk-reward profile with blockchain stocks, I give you Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN). Unlike other crypto-related market ideas, CAN has been a losing entity. In the past 52 weeks, shares incurred downside of more than 34%. That’s the opposite of many other mining enterprises, which have seen incredible returns. So, what gives?\n\nContrary to a company like Riot Platforms or Cipher Mining, Canaan isn’t a direct mining business. Rather, it provides specialized mining equipment. Now, the aforementioned pivot to PoS protocols presents a headwind. That’s because PoS emphasizes stake in the underlying network whereas PoW emphasizes raw computing power. Less influence among PoW blockchains might spell problems for Canaan.\n\nHowever, I still like CAN as a speculative idea for blockchain stock picks because again, PoS is relatively unproven. And the protocol tends to benefit early adopters because they would have the most stake in the target network. That’s not decentralization – that’s an aristocracy, a concept that blockchain advocates generally despise.\n\nSo, look for Canaan to be a dark horse play among blockchain stocks.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’m going to save what I consider the wildcard among blockchain stocks for last and that would be Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). Clearly, as a crypto exchange and wallet service, Coinbase is a blockchain play under a tangential interpretation. Still, I think we can all agree that Coinbase wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the blockchain. Plus, it has done so much to help forward awareness of decentralized digital assets.\n\nStill, it’s not without its challenges. Due to the recent volatility that impacted the crypto space, COIN lost about 12% of equity value for the week ending Jan. 12. Since the beginning of the year, it’s down almost 25% so not the most auspicious of starts. And to add to the misery, analysts rate shares a consensus hold with a $119.22 price target. That implies almost 9% downside risk.\n\nNevertheless, the Fed could change everything with its monetary policy pivot. Under a dovish environment, an incentive to do something with dollars – rather than stuffing them under the mattress – materializes. Further, the more aggressive the cuts, the more that risk-on assets may benefit.\n\nThat could be a huge positive for cryptos and subsequently COIN stock. Therefore, it’s one of the blockchain stock picks for market gamblers to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing great Peter Lynch steered Fidelity Magellan from a fund with $20 million in assets under management (AUM) to $14 billion in AUM in just 13 years years. That’s a compounded annual growth rate greater than 29% and why he is considered a stock market legend. While Lynch may be a legend, that doesn’t mean that AI isn’t slowly becoming a savvy stock predictor as well. In face, there are stocks that AI predicts may become 10-baggers.\n\nCombing through the universe of stocks looking for ones that could grow to 10 times my initial investment is daunting. So why not enlist the help of artificial intelligence? It can sort through millions of data points in seconds and spit out stocks that meet your criteria.\n\nI turned to Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) CoPilot (formerly Bing Chat) because it’s the one place you can use the latest version of ChatGPT for free. GPT-4 is the more powerful and more accurate version of OpenAI’s chatbot. While I still wouldn’t trust AI to make my investment decisions for me, here are the three stocks AI thinks can be 10-baggers in 10 years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTo no one’s surprise, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tops the list of stocks the can increase 10 times over the next decade. If it maintains last year’s pace it will happen a heckuva lot sooner. The chipmaker more than tripled in value in 2023 and was largely responsible for the gains made by the S&P 500. Nvidia was the fifth largest and second most influential component in the index behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The stock is already up 10% in 2024.\n\nIf Nvidia can achieve this feat it will be because of AI. It is the leading chipmaker specializing in the kinds of technology needed for AI to process all the data required by supercomputers and data center infrastructure. Nvidia’s HGX with InfiniBand platform is already running most generative AI applications, including ChatGPT and CoPilot. Others include Adobe‘s (NASDAQ:ADBE) Firefly, ServiceNow‘s (NYSE:NOW) Now Assist, and Zoom Video‘s (NASDAQ:ZM) AI Companion.\n\nStory continues\n\nI’ve suggested Nvidia is priced for perfection and any sort of hiccup with AI’s adoption could send NVDA stock lower. However, a really good argument can be made that for a company like Nvidia that is on a long-term trajectory higher, waiting to buy is immaterial. The few dollars per share you’ll gain by holding off on buying now will be inconsequential if it achieves 10 times your original investment in 10 years.\n\nNio (NIO) NIO logo, sign atop of North American headquarters and global software development center in Silicon Valley. NIO is Chinese electric autonomous vehicles manufacturer\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) is another stock CoPilot picked to generate massive returns for investors. It is developing a portfolio of smart vehicles that blend the best of EV and autonomous vehicle capabilities. As a fast-growing EV maker in the world’s largest EV market while expanding sales to other markets, it seems like an easy pathway for growth.\n\nYet I’m hesitant about recommending Nio stock. It is cutting prices on its vehicles like most other manufacturers, new trade restrictions with China means entering the United States market won’t be easy, and it’s cutting jobs to conserve cash. Nio produces losses on every car it makes and those losses are widening.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates sovereign fund infused it with more than $3 billion in cash. The Middle East is shaping up to be an important market for EVs. Countries there are trying to diversify away from oil as their primary revenue source. Saudi Arabia is similarly investing heavily in Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID).\n\nNio has its battery-swap business to lean on but wants to spin it off to focus on making EVs profitably. Batteries-as-a-service is a model other EV makers could use to overcome buyer concerns about limited driving distances. Nio can swap out a battery in three minutes.\n\nIf NIO stock is going to grow 10 times your initial investment it’s off to a rocky start. It lost 10% last year and is down more than 20% year to date. It’s one reason why I think you can’t outsource your investment decisions to AI.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBut I do think Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a good pick to mint millionaires. It is using AI to transform “from being not only the number one CRM, but to the number one AI CRM.” Because of AI, CEO Marc Benioff says Salesforce is now the third-largest enterprise software company in the world by revenue behind Microsoft and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). This was achieved despite 2023 not being a great year for cloud software stocks.\n\nGlobal IT spending fell below 20% for the first time last year and fell to 16% in the third quarter. Analysts at Canalys, however, suggest the market has finally stabilized and AI will be the primary driver going forward. AI is already offsetting most of the decline in traditional cloud spending. That will only accelerate as enterprises pick up the pace of investing in new AI strategies.\n\nIt was AI that drove CRM’s Q3 revenue 11% higher while widening adjusted operating margins from 19.9% to 31.6%. Salesforce is also investing in other AI businesses to help them grow. Its $500 million Salesforce Ventures takes stakes in unique small AI startups such as Anthropic, Cohere, and Hugging Face.\n\nSalesforce was the best-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year and is rising again this year. The customer relationship management outfit’s total return over the past decade has nearly quadrupled in size. With AI pushing it forward, it could readily grow 10 times in 10 years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Market forces unleashed a sizable rally in U.S. equities in 2023. Although policymakers and equities traders were not out of the woods yet on the macroeconomic front, many positive signs in recent economic data fueled optimism. The Federal Reserve has already projected rate cuts most likely during the latter half of 2024, given how the December CPI report came in unexpectedly hot. Either way, interests will likely come down. Now is the time for investors to equilibrate and choose which stocks are poised to rally. Below are three of my ideas.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made many of my lists before, and I still stress investors do not count this stock out in terms of having a great impact on artificial intelligence (AI). AMD’s relentless innovation and strong business model allowed the chipmaker to overtake Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market during the last decade. Last year, the chipmaker announced how it would tackle the AI market. In particular, during its second-quarter earnings report, it finally announced the MI300x GPU chipset, competing directly with Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) A100 and H100 chips — used to train LLMs. AMD announced it expects to sell $2 billion in AI chips this year.\n\nIf AMD can compete with Nvidia on pricing, its AI chips will likely have traction, leading to an unprecedented rally in the company’s shares.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares in solar panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) returned only just over 15% in 2023. Last year, investor sentiment soured on clean energy stocks due to relatively lower fossil fuel energy prices when compared to 2022. However, First Solar generated $3.2 billion in revenue on an LTM basis, and perhaps most importantly, the company is profitable with a 15% net margin over the last 12 months. The company also maintained volatility throughout that year. It was able to consecutively increase earnings while growing revenue by double-digit percentage points. First Solar also made gains on the manufacturing front, with an announcement of a new $1.1 billion manufacturing site in Louisiana and a signed 15-year Power Purchase Agreement guaranteeing power to a new manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates, government support from the Inflation Reduction Act, and a relatively cheap EV/EBITDA multiple could help incite a rally in First Solar in 2024.\n\nFrontline (FRO) Aerial front side view of oil tanker ship sailing on open sea, Imperial Petroleum (IMPP) operates oil tankers\n\nSource: Igor Karasi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrontline (NYSE:FRO) is a large oil tanker company boasting a fleet of 84 vessels that transport crude oil and refined products across the globe. Frontline’s stock performed very well in 2023, nearly doubling in price. As a result of OPEC’s production cuts, oil tankers have found themselves increasingly traveling across to the Atlantic Ocean to ship crude from Brazil, the United States and Guyana to countries in Asia. Those longer distances have pushed up ton-miles, or the amount of crude shipped and the distance, and as a result, revenue.\n\nContinued geopolitical tumult in the Middle East has led many leading shipping companies, including Maersk (OTCMKTS:AMKBY), to abandon their routes through the Suez Canal due to recent attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels. That means ships from Asia destined for Europe (and vice versa) are largely electing to go around Africa to access the European continent. That will put upward pressure on ton-miles, which could generate a huge profit windfall for shipping companies. Frontline, for its part, also provides a dividend that could be even more generous this year as profit margins expand.\n\nMoreover, despite U.S. and U.K. strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, the safety of the Suez Canal is still not secured, and it only takes a handful of successful Houthi drones to scare shipping companies off. Investors should expect shipping rates to remain elevated for the short and medium term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The U.S. saw a record 1.2 million EV sales in 2023 amidst high inflation and interest rates and a drop in EV demand. However, this gives us pause to consider the effects of low inflation for EV makers. Now is the best time to consider the best EV stocks to buy.\n\nFurther, new leader BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) dethroned Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as fourth quarter EV sales surged. So, if BYD and Tesla are still too expensive for your wallet, now is the time to identify more affordable stocks that could become the next EV champion. Let’s examine three such companies for 2024.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto’s (NASDAQ:LI) steady revenue growth surpassed expectations, with proof in December delivery numbers of 50,353 vehicles, a 137% year over year (YOY) increase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd, for the quarter, the deliveries came in at 131,805, up 184% YOY. LI is hitting new milestones on its path of best quarter ever. For Q4, it expects revenue range between $5.27 billion to $5.40 billion.\n\nRecently, it announced a new partnership with the tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for autonomous driving. Nvidia’s centralized car computer DRIVE Thor will power the upcoming fleet of Li Auto, and it could work as a catalyst this year. The computer will include multiple functions in the single AI platform and could boost car sales.\n\nLI stock is trading at $31, appearing undervalued and feasibly doubling in 2024. The company plans to launch Li Mega MPV on March 1, with deliveries beginning a few days afterward. This will likely boost stock price. Back in November, LI had over 10,000 units reserved within the first two hours after pre-sales began. Li’s future looks bright.\n\nVolkswagen (VWAGY) Silhouettes of charging electric car and wind turbines. Getting electricity from renewable energy sources. EVs. Electric vehicles. EV stocks.\n\nSource: Scharfsinn / Shutterstock\n\nIf you want to make the most of the global transition towards EVs, it is time to consider Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). The company is already recognized worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith years of experience and global standing to the EV sector, and it looks cheap currently. Once the industry improves and demand rises, we could see the stock move higher. Known for sophisticated cars with a strong range, VWAGY is considered value for money. It aims to produce 3 million small EVs between 2025 to 2030 at its two plants in Spain.\n\nVolkswagen’s impressive sales of 531,500 all-electric vehicles in the first nine months of 2023 shows a 45% YOY increase. The revenue came in at $255.1 billion for the first three quarters, and the operating profit stood at $20.3 billion for the same period. The industry may have seen a slower EV demand, but Volkswagen knows this is temporary. Further, it is launching the third EV which is a sedan with a range of 300 miles.\n\nVWAGY is a good play as the industry gears up for a strong year, and buying the stock at the current level could be a solid move.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) 2024 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup truck at the New York Auto Show. GM stock.\n\nSource: quiggyt4 / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) suffered due to the drop in EV demand. Even potential investors started doubting the company’s ability when Warren Buffett exited his position in the company. But a lot is working in favor of the automaker. Recently, GM boosted its dividend, a move companies usually make when it has control of their finances.\n\nGeneral Motors’ newest quarterly results proved the same. It reported a revenue of $44.13 billion, up 5% YOY and the EPS increased to $2.28, up 1%. The company saw a rise in cash, total assets, and short-term investments, showing its resilience in an uncertain market. It has enough liquidity to continue investing in the business as it focuses upon autonomous technology.\n\nGM reinstated the full-year earnings guidance and announced a $10 billion share buyback program with a 33% rise in the dividend. It enjoys a dividend yield of 1.02% and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.09. The company had to suffer due to the cost of the Union Auto Workers strike, but that is temporary. So, it will be able to deliver profits in the year. Also, the stock is trading at $35 but has gone past the days when it was as low as $26.\n\nIf the company can manage to improve the EV lineup, we could see a significant rise in profit. While General Motors is on its way to the top, it’s a dividend stock that sets itself apart from the other EV stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) isn't just another tech buzzword; it's a groundbreaking force, reshaping our lives and businesses. In a memorable blog post from the spring of 2023, Microsoft founder Bill Gates compared AI's game-changing powers to the introduction of the internet and the mobile phone:\n\nIt will change the way people work, learn, travel, get healthcare, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.\n\nAnd Gates is not a lone voice in the wilderness. For instance, futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil respectfully dissented when asked to sign an open letter calling for a pause in high-powered AI research. \"There are tremendous benefits to advancing AI in critical fields such as medicine and health, education, pursuit of renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels, and scores of other fields,\" Kurzweil wrote.\n\nThe renowned scientist, serving as Alphabet's director of engineering since 2012, saw this revolution coming decades ago. Kurzweil used to believe that affordable household-level computers would eclipse human brain power around the year 2020. That deadline has moved to 2045 or thereabouts, but \"humanity 2.0\" is still coming. You can't stop progress -- you can only hope to contain it.\n\nThe world is changing before our eyes, and the next generation of humans will co-exist with AI-powered computers in a whole new way. These sea changes are rare and extremely powerful. Experts like Gates and Kurzweil argue that AI is the next truly game-changing technology.\n\nSo it's high time to prepare for what's next. For investors like you and me, that means grabbing a diversified basket of promising AI stocks. Here's why SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) and IBM(NYSE: IBM) would be helpful components of that basket.\n\nSoundHound: Making the leap from tunes to tech\n\nYou may know SoundHound for its music identification app. You know the drill -- play a few seconds of any song into your smartphone's microphone, give SoundHound another couple of seconds to find sonic patterns in that sample, and get data such as the song title, artist, composer, and lyrics.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivals like Shazam (now a part of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)) and Deezer work by \"fingerprinting\" the audio and matching the result to a database of known signatures. SoundHound's AI-based system digs deeper into the characteristics of the track before matching a more sophisticated range of patterns. For example, SoundHound can isolate the melody line, allowing you to find tunes by singing or humming into your phone -- in the wrong key, at an unexpected tempo, or in a noisy environment. Shazam's simpler approach can't do that.\n\nBut song-ID services are not terribly lucrative, so SoundHound has expanded its focus around the core expertise of AI-powered audio analysis. So SoundHound built a powerful audio recognition engine known as Houndify around its years of song-focused research and oodles of data from those 10-second samples. The company quickly found clients in the automotive industry and consumer electronics. More recently, SoundHound launched voice-driven tools for restaurant management.\n\nNow, SoundHound is a direct bet on AI technology delivering superior results to more traditional consumer-facing systems. You'll run across automated Houndify interactions at drive-through windows and in call center phone menus. If you've gotten used to telling your car what radio station to play or what temperature you want in the air conditioning, you may very well use SoundHound's Houndify every day without knowing it.\n\nAnd this little company is going places. SoundHound's trailing revenues stood at $19.6 million in the summer of 2022, just after its initial public offering (IPO). It has nearly doubled since then to $38.2 million. The company is unprofitable so far but getting closer to the breakeven point in every quarter. Furthermore, the stock isn't exactly setting the world on fire. SoundHound's shares have traded sideways since November 2022, despite the AI boom of 2023.\n\nI expect big things from SoundHound AI as it continues to expand into new target markets while refining its pricing and profits. In a worst-case scenario, the company could be a buyout target for some tech giant without a credible audio analysis platform. But ideally, this undervalued growth stock should have room to run higher for many years as a stand-alone business.\n\nIBM: Not your grandpa's old-school tech giant anymore\n\nBig Blue is a long-standing leader in the tech industry, with a trend-setting presence in the AI segment through its Watson platform. This AI system, famous for winning \"Jeopardy!\" and beating the world champion of chess in 1999, has evolved into a powerful tool for business analytics and cloud services. IBM is happy to leave consumer-grade AI tools to other companies, focusing on business-grade services instead.\n\nIBM's shift to hybrid cloud computing and AI-focused strategies under CEOs Ginni Rometty and Arvind Krishna signals a commitment to remaining relevant in the rapidly advancing tech landscape.\n\nThe company's recent financials show a steady trajectory, with a renewed focus on high-margin cloud and AI services. Sales are up by 7% over the last two years while free cash flows rose 15% and diluted earnings per share jumped 50% higher. These positive trends include an inflation-driven dip in 2022: IBM Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThis pivot positions IBM as a stable and promising investment in the AI field, backed by a legacy of innovation and a clear vision for the future. And investors seem to have forgotten about IBM's robust AI chops amid the recent boom. Big Blue's stock trades at a bargain-bin valuation of 12.5 times free cash flows and 22 times earnings, having gained a below-par 14% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nIf you're looking for a powerful AI stock without the lofty trillion-dollar price tags of market darlings like Nvidia or Microsoft, IBM strikes me as a top idea today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Top-rated AI stocks enjoyed a dominant 2023 as more investors realized the potential of this technology. But, when stocks experience significant rallies, it’s easy to wonder if they are due for corrections.\n\nMany AI stocks have continued to perform well in 2024, including some of the picks on this list. However, some AI stocks have missed out on the fun and look more reasonably valued given the sector’s fanfare.\n\nSome investors turn to Wall Street analysts to gauge whether they should buy a stock or stay away from it. Analysts study stocks for a living and have a better grasp on what to look. Investors looking to get more exposure to top-rated AI stocks may want to consider these Wall Street favorites.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) 3D rendering of a female robot looking very sad. Dark background. AI stocks are down. AI Stocks. doomed AI Stocks\n\nSource: Sarah Holmlund / Shutterstock.com\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a surging AI stock that has won praise from many analysts. The software and service provider has an average price target of $361.33 which implies an almost 7% upside. The median price target is $400 while the high is $500.\n\nThe company’s data center servers can process the high intensity of artificial intelligence. A partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) bodes well for the company and can fuel more revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThe stock outperformed Nvidia and most of the competition over the past year. Shares surged by over 300% during that time and are up by nearly 2,164% over the past five years. Shares currently trade at a 31 P/E ratio.\n\nSupermicro started fiscal 2024 with 14.4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. The company raised its fiscal 2024 outlook from $10 billion to $11 billion in revenue. The ongoing GPU supply constraints have not stopped the company from growing. Once this headwind fades away, hypergrowth may resume.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) is an undervalued semiconductor stock that offers ion implantation technology. Instead of making chips, the company assists chipmakers with making more efficient chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts Purion systems have experienced robust demand with order backlog exceeding the company’s revenue for all of 2022. The significant backlog is present in the context of booming revenue and earnings growth.\n\nIn the third quarter, revenue increased by 27.6% year-over-year while net income jumped by 63.7% year-over-year. The stock has been battered in recent months without much news to warrant the decline. Shares now trade at a 16 P/E ratio which looks like a bargain.\n\nThe stock has an average price target of $183 among five analysts. That price target implies a 60% upside from the current price. The highest price target is $215 while the lowest price target is $134. Even the lowest price target still suggests the stock can rally by 17.5% from here.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia seems to attract fans left and right while converting most, if not all, of its bearish investors. Any stock with a 209% gain over the past year and a 5-year gain of 1,295% is bound to draw attention.\n\nThe valuation was one of the few concerns investors had about the stock. However, Nvidia has silenced valuation concerns with stellar revenue and earnings growth. Revenue grew by 206% year-over-year while net income soared by 1,259% year-over-year. Investors don’t come across those types of numbers often.\n\nIt’s the first time I’ve seen a company achieve those growth rates for multiple quarters, and Nvidia isn’t even a microcap. The tech giant’s market cap exceeded $1 trillion in 2023 and it’s not a stretch to say that this company’s market cap can exceed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) within a few years.\n\nThere’s been a lot of AI hype, but Nvidia’s financial strength comes with a 28-forward P/E ratio and a 0.55 PEG ratio. There’s a lot to like about the stock, and analysts seem to agree. The average price target of $662 suggests a 21% upside from the current price. This average price target comes from 35 analysts. Of those analysts, 32 of them rated NVDA as a “Buy” while four of them rated it as a “Hold.”\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SMCI, ACLS and NVDA.

        "content": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke about the company's vision for AI at Chatham House, in London, on Monday. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will displace jobs but remains optimistic about the impact even as the IMF warned that almost 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of AI.\n\nNadella told an audience at London’s Chatham House on Monday that every big technological revolution displaces jobs but that the technology will help develop new career skills.\n\n“There will be jobs, the question is the shape of these jobs. If anything, these tools can be very helpful with getting us the skills for what is the new set of tasks,” he said.\n\n“Everyone can become an expert in anything because they have an AI assistant,” he added.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that AI is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs. The organisation said the impact will be greater for advanced economies, with around 60% of roles affected.\n\nRead more: LIVE: FTSE 100 hovers with AI in the spotlight as global leaders head to Davos\n\nAbout half of those workers will benefit from the integration of AI, which could boost productivity, but the remainder could see lower salaries, reduced hiring and, “in the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear”, according to the IMF.\n\n“In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions,” IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said.\n\nNadella has made a push for Microsoft to assume a global leadership role in AI. The company has a significant stake in leading AI startup ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, and reportedly invested up to $13bn in the startup. This alliance has been considered one of the tech industry’s most lucrative tie-ups.\n\nMicrosoft pushed for OpenAi’s chief executive Sam Altman to be reinstated after a messy corporate dispute in November.\n\nNadella and Altman are both scheduled to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI has allowed it to roll out Copilot, an AI enabled software assistant.\n\nGoing even further, a new Copilot key will ship on a variety of new PCs and laptops from Microsoft’s partners, providing quick access to Copilot straight from a keyboard button press.\n\nThe Copilot key is the first big change to the Windows PC keyboard layout in nearly three decades.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Crest Nicholson, PageGroup, Baidu and United Airlines\n\nThe hype around AI has allowed Microsoft to overtake Apple (AAPL) as the most valuable company in the world.\n\nOn Friday, Microsoft’s market capitalisation stood at $2.887tn, a new record high for the company, and above Apple’s market cap of $2.875tn.\n\nThe last time the software giant earned the title of most valuable company in the world was back in 2021.\n\nRead more: Microsoft topples Apple to become global market cap leader\n\nShares in Microsoft climbed over 50% in 2023 and analysts expect AI to take it even higher this year.\n\nOther AI-focused tech players such as Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet ( GOOG), also witnessed a big jump in their market cap in the past year, Reuters reported.\n\nAt Chatham House, Nadella also said that he is \"sanguine\" about the risk AI poses to political elections.\n\n“Election interference existed before AI,” the Microsoft CEO said, adding that the world can learn from these past election cycles.\n\nWatch: Apple & Microsoft: The future of AI in consumer tech<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">AAPL</a>) and Microsoft (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">MSFT</a>) at CES 2024 (Consumer Electronics Show) as, for a brief moment, Microsoft took over <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-briefly-overtakes-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-before-apple-takes-back-crown-165431534.html\\\">as the most valuable company</a> for the first time since 2021.

Not long after, it would hit a high of $17.47, with a near 7% yield to boot.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition to AT&T, here are some other top blue-chip stocks you can buy on the cheap.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Southwest Airlines (LUV) Southwest Airlines logo on aircraft that is taking off from McCarran in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nSource: Eliyahu Yosef Parypa / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Nov. 17, I also highlighted an opportunity in Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), as it traded at $24.50.\n\nAt the time, I noted, “the airline stock plummeted to a low of $22.01 – a low it hasn’t seen since 2014. However, with a good deal of negativity priced into the stock, the pullback appears a bit overdone.” Not long after, LUV would hit $29.84 and could see higher highs. Better, as we wait for further recovery, we can collect its current yield of 2.41%.\n\nHelping, analysts at Susquehanna just raised their price target to $30 from $23 on the LUV stock. “The firm believes 2024 is setting up to be a year where idiosyncratic factors drive absolute and relative stock returns for the airlines, with network exposure, the ‘premiumization’ of travel, fleets and order books, labor, service, and cost control driving the investment narratives and debates,” as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) the front wheels of a series of cars in a line\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nI also highlighted Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) on Nov. 17, as it traded at around $136. While it’s only up to $138.43, give it time. I still believe it could refill its bearish gap around $147.50, with patience. Plus, as we wait for that to happen, we can collect its yield of 2.75%. There’s nothing wrong with getting paid to wait – especially with a top blue-chip stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, earnings haven’t been anything to write home about, but most of that negativity has been priced into the stock. In its most recent quarter, the company posted third quarter EPS of $2.49, which beat expectations by seven cents. Unfortunately, revenue of $5.82 billion – up 2.5% year-over-year – did miss by $90 million.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaper. Blue-Chip Stocks at Low\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there’s always an exchange-traded fund to buy into. With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG) invests at least 80% of its funds in blue chip companies. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and many more of the biggest, most well-respected stocks on the market.\n\nSince the end of October, the ETF did run from about $27.50 to a high of $33.70. At its current price, it has become slightly over-extended and could see a healthy pullback. So, you may want to wait for that to happen before jumping in. Longer-term, I’d like to see it closer to $40.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also Nike (NYSE:NKE).\n\nOver the last few weeks, the stock gapped from about $122.85 to $105.90. All on news of concerning sales outlook. However, it looks like most of that negativity has been priced in, with the stock attempting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. The last time these indicators became this oversold, NKE bounced from about $89 to $122.85. From its current price of $105.90, I’d like to see it refill its gap around $122.85 again soon.\n\nBetter, while we wait for NKE to recover, we can collect its yield of 1.4%. Furthermore, analysts at Truist just raised their price target on NKE to $111 from $107. Citi analysts have also called the pullback a buying opportunity, with a $135 price target.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe can also look at Realty Income (NYSE:O), which pays out a monthly dividend, and carries a current yield of 5.19%.  Most recently, the company declared its 643rd consecutive monthly dividend of $0.2565 per share, or $3.078 annualized, payable on Feb. 15 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 1.\n\nNot only is Realty Income a reliable, dividend-paying realty powerhouse, it’s been around for more than 50 years now. Better, it has 13,100 properties, and it’s still seeing strong demand with an occupancy rate of 99%. Some of its top tenants include Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreen’s (NASDAQ:WBA), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), BJ’s (NYSE:BJ), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) to name just a few.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center.

According to the company, “P&G has been paying a dividend for 133 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890 and has increased its dividend for 67 consecutive years.”\n\nPlus, as a barometer of consumer strength, its earnings have been solid, too.  In its most recent quarter, the company posted core earnings of $1.83 a share on revenue of $21.9 billion. Analysts were only looking for $1.72 on $21.6 billion in sales.\n\n“We delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, putting us on track to deliver towards the higher end of our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales and core EPS growth,” said Jon Moeller, the company’s chairman and CEO.\n\nIn the long term, PG will remain one of the strongest, dividend-paying blue-chip stocks to own.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nOne of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) delivers growth, reliability, and dividends. With a yield of 3.08%, the company recently paid out a 46-cent dividend on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record as of Dec. 1. I expect to hear of a newer dividend shortly.\n\nEarnings have been solid, too. In its most recent quarter, the company earned 74 cents a share on revenue of $11.95 billion. That was well ahead of expectations for 69 cents and revenue of $11.4 billion. Better, the company expects to grow organic sales by 10% to 11% from prior guidance of 8% to 9%, as noted by Barron’s contributor Teresa Rivas.\n\nHelping, analysts at Citi just raised their price target on KO to $67 with a buy rating. Deutsche Bank raised its price target to $62, with a hold rating.

        "title": "2 Incredible Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024 Before They Rocket 101% and 182% Higher, According to 2 Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in 2023 and took the stock market along for the ride. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite helped lead the charge, soaring 43% last year. Stocks that are focused on advances in generative AI booked some of the most notable gains, and it appears that trend could continue in 2024.\n\nThe accelerating adoption of generative AI brings with it the promise of significant productivity gains. By automating certain processes, these algorithms can help make workers more productive. Its uses include generating updates from meetings, creating slide shows from existing documents, summarizing emails and drafting responses, and writing and debugging computer code.\n\nNo one knows for sure how lucrative AI will ultimately be, but estimates are eye-opening. Projections from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs estimate the economic impact at $6 trillion and $7 trillion, respectively, by the end of this decade.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, here are two stocks investors should consider buying before they rocket 101% and 182% (or more) over the coming year, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. SoundHound AI: Implied upside of 182%\n\nSoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) isn't a household name, but it has a long and distinguished history of providing voice and audio AI solutions to its customers.\n\nThe company has been at the cutting edge of voice-recognition AI for nearly two decades. What began as a music recognition and discovery app soon evolved into the leading voice recognition software used by a host of business and enterprise customers.\n\nThe company is currently focused on the automotive and restaurant industries and recently acquired SYNQ3, extending its market reach and making it the largest provider of voice AI services to restaurants. The company uses its generative AI to provide voice-ordering capabilities for restaurants via drive-thrus, self-serve kiosks, and phone orders.\n\nFor example, a collaboration with hamburger chain White Castle yielded drive-thru orders that were processed in under 60 seconds with a 90% order completion rate -- exceeding staff-based benchmarks. This comes at a time when restaurants are struggling to maintain adequate staffing.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the third quarter, SoundHound AI generated revenue of $13.3 million, up 19% year over year and 52% sequentially. The company isn't yet profitable but is making progress as its $0.09 loss per share improved from a $0.15 loss in the prior-year quarter. Add to that its small market cap of just $453 million as of this writing, and the stock is a bit on the risky side, but it has attracted the attention of Wall Street in a big way.\n\nD.A. Davidson analysts have a buy rating on SoundHound AI and a price target of $5, which suggests potential upside for investors of 182%. The analysts cited the performance of SoundHound's Voice AI platform, which they believe will \"set the standard for performance [...] in the voice artificial intelligence market,\" ultimately capturing substantial market share along the way.\n\nThey aren't the only ones. Of the five analysts who issued a rating in December, every single one rated it a buy or strong buy.\n\nLastly, trading at less than 5 times forward sales, the stock is near its cheapest valuation ever. Investors should consider a stake in the company as a small part of a balanced portfolio.\n\n2. Nvidia: Implied upside of 101%\n\nThe accelerating demand for AI solutions over the past year has been astonishing, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster child for that secular tailwind.\n\nIts graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for machine learning (an established branch of AI) with 95% of the market, according to market intelligence firm CB Insights. The company leaned into its expertise to usher in the era of generative AI and is capturing a large part of that market as well.\n\nNvidia recently developed the H200 Tensor Core GPU, specifically to meet the demands of AI. Management says the new superchip delivers nearly double the capacity and 2.4 times more bandwidth compared to its predecessor, the A100.\n\nAfter generating back-to-back quarters of triple-digit year-over-year growth, the company isn't letting up at all. Nvidia is guiding for its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter revenue to grow 231% to a record $20 billion, driven by accelerating adoption of AI.\n\nAs a result, the stock soared 239% in 2023, but Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann believes there's more upside ahead. He maintains a buy rating on the stock, with a Street-high price target of $1,100, suggesting the stock could soar 101% from here. Mosesmann said Nvidia's performance is \"simply unprecedented and just getting started.\"\n\nHe goes further, suggesting his peers are underestimating the need to modernize data centers, which will require the latest and greatest chips to handle the rigorous demands of AI uses in the cloud. Mosesmann calculates the data-center installed base at $1 trillion, resulting in an unparalleled upgrade cycle. Enter Nvidia, the leading provider of GPUs powering data centers -- with an estimated 95% of that market as well.\n\nMosesmann isn't alone. Of the 53 analysts with a rating for Nvidia in December, 51 rated it a buy or strong buy, and not one recommended selling.\n\nThe stock trades at an extremely reasonable price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1, compared to a PEG ratio of more than 2 for the S&P 500. By that measure, which factors in its meteoric growth, it's among the cheapest of all the high-growth AI stocks.\n\nGenerative AI is still in its infancy, which suggests a long and profitable road ahead for Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and SoundHound AI wasn't one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +11.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 12.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.49 per share, indicating a change of +410.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.31 points to a change of +268.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.07 indicates a change of +63.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $20.1 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +232.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $58.92 billion and $90.57 billion estimates indicate +118.4% and +53.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +205.5%. EPS of $4.02 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.9%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Nvidia Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company’s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company’s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company’s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.\r\n\r\nSanta Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023, slightly up from $26.91 billion in fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\nBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments – Graphics and Compute & Networking.\r\n\r\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\r\n\r\nCompute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 44% and 56% of fiscal 2023 revenues, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Nvidia a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2014 would be worth $139,122.70, or a 13,812.27% gain, as of January 15, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 159.66% and the price of gold increased 60.15% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.\n\nNVIDIA's Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nThe stock has jumped 11.90% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 15 higher, for fiscal 2024; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "AI Cheat Sheet: Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Keep Your Eyes On in 2024",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) took over Wall Street in 2023 and arguably drove the broader market's turnaround last year. But AI boils down to more than just owning any stock that happens to have some connection to those two magic letters. Inevitably, hype attracts both contenders and pretenders. Some AI stocks will be winners, and some won't.\n\nWant to know which AI stocks to consider in 2024? I've made you a cheat sheet to point you in the right direction.\n\nHere are the five AI stocks you need to have on your radar:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) PalantirTechnologies(NYSE: PLTR) ASML(NASDAQ: ASML)\n\nHere's why these five AI stocks are worth watching in 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe company's stock exploded by 230% over the past year, but the hype is warranted. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the go-to hardware for AI applications. Their cutting-edge technology and the fact that they're good for demanding computing applications helped propel Nvidia to an estimated 80% to 95% market share for AI chips. You can see how companywide revenue nearly doubled to $45 billion in 2023: NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nConsidering AI is still a nascent industry and given that Nvidia sits in the driver's seat, the company is poised for tremendous long-term earnings growth. Competitors will surely come for Nvidia's market share, but their success is no guarantee. Until proven otherwise, Nvidia remains the chip king in the AI industry.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nFor a technology giant like Microsoft, AI might seem like an afterthought. After all, Microsoft dabbles in virtually everything, including cloud computing, gaming, enterprise software, and personal electronics. However, don't be fooled: AI is a priority for Microsoft. Investors will want to own Microsoft stock for its hefty investments and tight partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. MSFT EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nOpenAI is one of the world's fastest-growing companies. Microsoft's multibillion-dollar tie-up gives it the pole position for enjoying that growth and using it to benefit its other business segments. For example, Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, powers all OpenAI computing loads. It's not an obvious AI stock, but don't overlook its long-term AI opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Snowflake\n\nData might be the most essential ingredient of AI technology outside of computing power. However, data often comes from multiple sources and can be disorganized and hard to use. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse platform that securely stores, analyzes, and shares data. That makes it a potentially crucial role player for companies using AI. SNOW EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nSnowflake's rapid growth backs that up. The company's revenue has multiplied over the past several years, and analysts believe profits could compound at over 60% annually on average. Snowflake's data marketplace could someday be the go-to channel where companies access the data needed for their AI models.\n\n4. Palantir Technologies\n\nAI has become critical to the world's political powers. Palantir answers that bell. It has built and sold custom software to the U.S. government for years. Government business is over half of Palantir's revenue. The company is rapidly expanding its commercial business, too. PLTR EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nMost importantly, Palantir last year released AIP, a platform for implementing AI models. Management has noted that more than 300 organizations have tried AIP in the first five months since its launch. How big could AIP be in a few years? Palantir's tremendous expansion opportunities could mean that top- and bottom-line growth continues well into the future.\n\n5. ASML\n\nMany people don't realize that companies like Nvidia don't build the high-tech chips they sell. Factories, called fabs, make them. In those factories are cutting-edge machines that ASML creates. It's fair to say ASML has a monopoly. It virtually owns an estimated 90% market share for extreme ultraviolet lithography machines used to make advanced semiconductor chips. ASML EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nIf advancing AI models need top-notch chips to power them, manufacturers will need more of ASML's machines to make them. That's already shown up in ASML's revenue growth, which hit a spurt in 2023. Analysts expect a healthy 22% average annual earnings growth, so investors should buckle up. Investors should continue looking at ASML stock for as long as its machines build those high-tech chips powering AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 15, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, The Boeing Co. BA, Sony Group Corp. SONY, The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) and Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS).\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for NVIDIA, Boeing and Sony\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. , The Boeing Co. and Sony Group Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past six months (+19.3% vs. +16.9%). The company’s computer & networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+4% vs. -6.8%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.\r\n\r\nA strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term.\r\n\r\nHowever, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier joint venture might cause it to incur some loss in the future. Rising jet fuel price also poses a threat to the stock’s future growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Boeing here >>>)\r\n\r\nSony’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Audio Video Production industry over the past year (+13.7% vs. +12.7%). The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in the Games & Network (G&NS) segment. The company continues to expect to sell more than 25 million units of its PlayStation 5 in the current year.\r\n\r\nSONY sold 4.9 million units of PS5 in Q2, up 25% year over year. Strength in Music, and Pictures segments are other tailwinds. The Music segment benefits from higher recorded music and music publishing sales from paid subscription streaming services. Frequent product launches and strategic collaborations bode well.\r\n\r\nThe company also raised overall guidance for fiscal 2023 revenues It now expects sales of ¥12,400 billion compared with the earlier guidance of ¥12,200 billion. However, SONY lowered guidance for Pictures and Financial Services segments. Stiff competition and weak global macroeconomic conditions are concerning.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Sony here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Charles Schwab Corp. and Synopsys, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "IMF managing director on AI's impact: New social safety nets may be needed",
        "content": "The AI revolution may exert pressure on governments to enact new social safety nets to protect people who lose their jobs but are unable to upskill themselves, warns the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\"If we don't have thoughtful distribution of benefits [of AI] and inequality grows dramatically, that can break the social fabric in a way that is going to be very unhealthy for the world,\" IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva tells Yahoo Finance Live. \"Social safety nets in a world of artificial intelligence are paramount.\"\n\nGeorgieva's comments come amid the release of an extensive IMF study on the global economic impact of AI's proliferation on Sunday. The findings coincide with the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where AI will be a hot topic amongst high-profile tech attendees such as Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, OpenAI's Sam Altman, and Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nThose social safety nets may need a hefty amount of funds, if the IMF's findings are any indication.\n\nAbout 40% of global employment is exposed to AI, according to the IMF. In advanced economies, roughly 60% of jobs are exposed to AI due to the prevalence of \"cognitive task\" oriented jobs. Overall exposure is 40% in emerging markets and 26% in low-income countries, says the IMF.\n\nAlthough many emerging markets and developing economies may experience less immediate AI-related disruption, the IMF reasons they are also ready to capitalize on AI's advantages. This could \"exacerbate\" the \"digital divide\" and \"cross-country income disparity,\" the study concludes.\n\nGeorgieva thinks the elderly could see an outsized impact from AI's widespread adoption and be in need of a social safety net.\n\n\"You have to be able to support those that fall off a cliff because their jobs are wiped out. We also look at who are most adaptable. Obviously the younger generation, in some areas, women more adaptable, but in others less. And the older generation may need more support to catch up in this new world,\" Georgieva adds.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe IMF isn't a singular voice on possible economic aftershocks from AI.\n\nIn research of its own in 2023, Goldman Sachs economists found that advances in AI could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs globally to automation. In other words, job loss.\n\nGoldman's economists projected that roughly two-thirds of US occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI.\n\nLook no further than the news industry as a prime example of what the IMF and Goldman are discussing.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are well down the path of ingesting news and information and spewing it out to the global masses, lessening the need to visit a website. Media organizations, meantime, have moved to automate some functions of newsrooms to increase content quantity and slash costs.\n\nNews Corporation CEO Robert Thomson (NWSA) told Yahoo Finance Live in late 2023 that AI will be \"epochal\" for news.\n\nThomson went onto warn that the industry could face a \"tsunami potentially of job losses\" due to the new tech.\n\n\"These are not just jobs lost, it's insights lost. So it's important that all media companies understand the impact, but also, it's incumbent on the big AI players to understand their impact,\" Thomson added.

        "title": "China's military and government acquire Nvidia chips despite US ban",
        "content": "By Eduardo Baptista\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese military bodies, state-run artificial intelligence research institutes and universities have over the past year purchased small batches of Nvidia semiconductors banned by the U.S. from export to China, a Reuters review of tender documents show.\n\nThe sales by largely unknown Chinese suppliers highlight the difficulties Washington faces, despite its bans, in completely cutting off China's access to advanced U.S. chips that could fuel breakthroughs in AI and sophisticated computers for its military.\n\nBuying or selling high-end U.S. chips is not illegal in China and the publicly available tender documents show dozens of Chinese entities have bought and taken receipt of Nvidia semiconductors since restrictions were imposed.\n\nThese include its A100 and the more powerful H100 chip - whose exports to China and Hong Kong were banned in September 2022 - as well as the slower A800 and H800 chips Nvidia then developed for the Chinese market but which were also banned last October.\n\nThe graphic processing units - a type of chip - that are built by Nvidia are widely seen as far superior to rival products for AI work as they can more efficiently process huge amounts of data needed for machine-learning tasks.\n\nThe continued demand for and access to banned Nvidia chips also underlines the lack of good alternatives for Chinese firms despite the nascent development of rival products from Huawei and others. Prior to the bans, Nvidia commanded a 90% share of China's AI chip market.\n\nPurchasers included elite universities as well as two entities subject to U.S. export restrictions - the Harbin Institute of Technology and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, which have been accused of involvement in military matters or being affiliated to a military body contrary to U.S. national interest.\n\nThe former purchased six Nvidia A100 chips in May to train a deep-learning model. The latter purchased one A100 in December 2022. Its purpose was not identified.\n\nStory continues\n\nNone of the purchasers mentioned in this article responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe Reuters review found neither Nvidia nor retailers approved by the company were among the suppliers identified. It was not clear how the suppliers have procured their Nvidia chips. FILE PHOTO: Illustration shows NVIDIA logo\n\nIn the wake of U.S. curbs, however, an underground market for such chips in China has sprung up. Chinese vendors have previously said they snatch up excess stock that finds its way to the market after Nvidia ships large quantities to big U.S. firms, or import through companies locally incorporated in places such as India, Taiwan and Singapore.\n\nReuters sought comment from 10 of the suppliers listed in tender documents including those mentioned in this article - none of them answered.\n\nNvidia said it complies with all applicable export control laws and requires its customers to do the same.\n\n\"If we learn that a customer has made an unlawful resale to third parties, we'll take immediate and appropriate action,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce declined to comment. U.S. authorities have vowed to close loopholes in the export restrictions and have moved to limit access to the chips by units of Chinese companies located outside China.\n\nChris Miller, professor at Tufts University and author of \"Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology\", said it was unrealistic to think U.S. export restrictions could be watertight given that chips are small and can easily be smuggled.\n\nThe main aim is \"to throw sand in the gears of China's AI development\" by making it difficult to build large clusters of advanced chips capable of training AI systems, he added.\n\nMILITARY, AI BUYERS\n\nThe review includes more than 100 tenders where state entities have procured A100 chips and dozens of tenders since the October ban show purchases of the A800.\n\nTenders published last month also show Tsinghua University procured two H100 chips while a laboratory run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology procured one.\n\nThe buyers include one unnamed People's Liberation Army entity based in the city of Wuxi, Jiangsu province, according to tenders from a military database. It sought 3 A100 chips in October and one H100 chip this month.\n\nMilitary tenders in China are often heavily redacted and Reuters was not able to learn who won the bids or the reason for the purchase.\n\nMost tenders show the chips are being used for AI. The quantities of most purchases are, however, very small, far from what's needed to build a sophisticated AI large language model from scratch.\n\nA model similar to OpenAI's GPT would require more than 30,000 Nvidia A100 cards, according to research firm TrendForce. But a handful can run complex machine-learning tasks and enhance existing AI models.\n\nIn one example, the Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute awarded a 290,000 yuan ($40,500) contract for 5 A100 chips to Shandong Chengxiang Electronic Technology last month.\n\nMany of the tenders stipulate suppliers have to deliver and install the products before receiving payment. Most universities also published notices showing the transaction was completed.\n\nTsinghua University, dubbed China's Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a prolific issuer of tenders and has purchased some 80 A100 chips since the 2022 ban.\n\nIn December, Chongqing University published a tender for one A100 chip that explicitly stated it could not be second-hand or disassembled but had to be \"brand new\". The delivery was completed this month, a notice showed.\n\n($1 = 7.1592 Chinese yuan)\n\n(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista; Additional reporting by Josh Ye in Hong Kong and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

        "title": "Billionaire Steve Cohen Aggressively Bought These 12 Stocks Recently",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 stocks that billionaire Steve Cohen bought aggressively recently. If you want to skip our overview of the billionaire hedge fund boss, his firm, and the latest news, then you can take a look at Billionaire Steve Cohen Aggressively Bought These 5 Stocks Recently.\n\nSteve Cohen is one of the richest people in the world, with Forbes estimating his net worth at $19.8 billion. The source of his wealth and fortune is the finance industry, with Mr. Cohen being known for having set up and run the hedge fund Point72 Asset Management. Mr. Cohen's hedge fund is also one of the biggest financial institutions in the world, with its latest portfolio estimate worth coming in at $34 billion.\n\nPoint72 Asset Management itself has somewhat of a controversial history. The hedge fund traces its roots back to 1992 when it was originally set up as SAC Capital. After being set up, the fund would end up posting double digit percentage returns. But its fortunes would dwindle as an insider trading investigation would see the firm pay more than a billion dollars to the SEC and cease operating in 2014. Two years later, Point72, a separate entity, would start accepting capital from outside investors.\n\nWhile Mr. Cohen is primarily in the news these days due to his sports franchise, his hedge fund has also been making big moves. 2022 and 2023 have been some of the most disruptive years for the hedge fund industry in its recent history as they have seen investors swing between traditional equities such as oil companies and high growth sectors such as artificial intelligence. Throughout 2022, the industry had to cope with the effects of high inflation on the growth sector and a re-balancing of the global oil supply chain in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Then, as it entered 2023 with calls of recession, funds had to re-balance their approach to focus on artificial intelligence as stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) raced to set record highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst this turmoil, Point72 has been busy re-calibrating its teams to better match the changed financial environment these days. 2024 is starkly different for the finance industry as investors have to cope with an era of high interest rates and their impact on stock valuations. Higher rates drag down stock valuations as a whole, and they also make it trickier for hedge funds to utilize leverage to finance their bets. As far as Mr. Cohen's hedge fund is concerned, it is expanding its macroeconomics teams to deal with today's environment. According to media reports, Point72 will have 51 macro trading teams this year, with two high profile executives due to join its ranks. The growth comes after the hedge fund brought eight money managers within its fold last year to grow its macro teams to 49. Macro teams focus on broader economic trends such as inflation and interest rates, and multiple quarters believe that the era of high interest rates is perfect for this particular trading sub segment.\n\nBut what about performance? Point72 is one of several hedge funds that have lagged the S&P 500 in returns last year. Data shows that the hedge fund ended the year by posting returns of 10.6%, while the S&P and the tech-heavy NASDAQ indexes delivered 24% and 41% returns during the same time period.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the stocks that Steve Cohen is aggressively buying. The top three are Axos Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AX), Hibbett, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIBB), and Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO).

        "content": "Investing.com-- Hong Kong shares of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) slid as much as 10% on Monday after the South China Morning Post reported that the technology giant’s flagship Ernie artificial intelligence was used in testing by the People’s Liberation Army.\n\nBaidu’s shares (HK:9888) fell 7.9% to HK$104.60 by 21:18 ET (02:18 GMT), after falling as far as 10% earlier in the session. The stock was headed for its worst day in nearly two years.\n\nThe broader Hang Seng index rose 0.1%.\n\nThe South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that a research laboratory associated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support Force had tested an experimental AI system on Baidu’s Ernie and peer IFlyTek’s Spark large language models.\n\nBaidu told the SCMP that the company had no affiliation with the laboratory, and that any version of the Ernie bot used in the testing was likely a publicly available version.\n\nBut the report ramped up concerns that any potential affiliation with the PLA could attract sanctions from the U.S., especially as both countries explore military applications of AI.\n\nBaidu’s Ernie bot was the company’s answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, coming just a few months after the latter, amid a global push into large language models. Baidu had already begun monetizing the model by late-2023, logging stronger sales in the third quarter on revenue from its AI offerings.\n\nBaidu’s Chinese peers Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) (HK:9988) and Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) had also raced to release their own offerings in 2023.\n\nBut China’s AI aspirations face some headwinds, particularly from the U.S. banning the sale of key AI-linked chips to Chinese entities. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the poster-child of making chips for AI development, can no longer sell its latest chips in China.\n\nTencent and Alibaba had warned that the ban could potentially hamper their AI development efforts. China has also hit back against the ban with sanctions of its own.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

Semiconductor stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Israel, Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSEM) manufactures integrated circuits (ICs) using specialty process technologies. Broadly, Tower represents a foundry service, meaning that it manufactures chips for other companies. Its acumen covers both analog and mixed-signal ICs, making the company vital for various industries. These applications include automotive, medical and industrial automation.\n\nJust to give an idea of the size of the total addressable market, by year’s end, experts in the field project revenue in the IC sector to reach $500.7 billion. Further, the segment could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.22% to 2027. If so, by the forecast culmination, the ecosystem could command market volume of over $600 billion.\n\nJust for context, TSEM’s market capitalization is a little over $3 billion.\n\nEnticingly, Tower shares trade at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 6X. Further, they trade at a trailing-year revenue multiple of 2.13X. Both stats are undervalued. Lastly, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $36.50 average price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nSkyWater Technology (SKYT) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in Bloomington, Minnesota, SkyWater Technology (NASDAQ:SKYT) offers geopolitical relevance. Per its public profile, SkyWater is the only U.S.-owned, pure-play silicon foundry. That’s significant due to the disruption of the global semiconductor supply chain during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis. There are too many chokepoints that could crimp economic development. Thus, SkyWater provides a sense of confidence and relief.\n\nWhile I don’t want to go down a rabbit hole, China’s overtures toward Taiwan presents huge risks. Let’s face it – Taiwan absolutely dominates the foundry market. Moreover, Allied Market Research points out that this sector reached a valuation of nearly $107 billion in 2022. Further, it could hit $231.5 billion by 2032, representing a CAGR of 8.1% from 2032.\n\nIt’s no wonder so many countries are jittery about the Taiwan independence issue. If it goes, the global economy could sink. And if that wasn’t enough to entice investors, SKYT trades at only 1.42X sales, below the sector median of 3X. With a unanimous strong buy rating, it’s one of the best semiconductor stocks.\n\nSemtech (SMTC) SMTC stock: The Semtech logo on a sign outside its building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Camarillo, California, Semtech (NASDAQ:SMTC) is a supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors. It also provides advanced algorithms for consumer, enterprise computing, communications, and industrial end markets. To be upfront, SMTC incurred considerable choppiness and volatility in 2023. I must say, it’s also not off to the most auspicious of starts to the new year.\n\nNevertheless, Semtech might make a case for the best semiconductor stocks on a comeback trail. With its acumen, the company provides various connectivity and signal conditioning applications. Many of its manufactured chips are integrated into audio/video, industrial, wireless, and data center functionalities. Unless you envision that all these market segments will become antiquated, SMTC carries at least some comeback credibility.\n\nAlso, SMTC trades for only 1.58X trailing-year revenue. While it may not have the most sterling financials, its revenue is above average and it’s consistently profitable. Finally, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $29.70 average price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 3 Red-Hot Tech Stocks That Could Split Their Shares in 2024",
        "content": "One of the most intriguing developments for investors over the past few years has been the return to popularity of stock splits. By and large, these moves have come on the heels of strong business performance, leading to equally strong stock price appreciation. Since stock splits don't have any effect on the underlying value of the business, the primary reason cited by companies is the desire to keep their shares affordable for the average retail investor.\n\nA look back at the past couple of years helps highlight this trend as numerous high-profile companies split their shares. These included:\n\nAmazon: 20-for-1 split June 3, 2022 DexCom: 4-for-1 split June 10, 2022 Shopify: 10-for-1 split June 28, 2022 Alphabet: 20-for-1 split July 15, 2022 Tesla: 3-for-1 split Aug. 24, 2022 Palo Alto Networks: 3-for-1 split Sept. 13, 2022 Monster Beverage: 2-for-1 split March 27, 2023 Celsius Holdings: 3-for-1 split Nov. 15, 2023\n\nA look at a few of the top-performing stocks of last year suggests there could be more stock splits on the docket in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is best known for pioneering the graphics processing units (GPUs) that render lifelike images in video games. Over the years, the company has adapted its chips to provide the computational horsepower necessary for cloud computing and data center uses and, most recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to data compiled by New Market Research, Nvidia currently controls roughly 95% of the market for processors used in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI. This suggests the company is well positioned to lead the generative AI market as well.\n\nRecent financial results seem to support that view. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), Nvidia delivered record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.71 surged 1,274%. Tepid results from the prior year skewed the comparison, but it helps illustrate the long runway ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has a long history of impressive growth, but excitement regarding its AI-fueled results drove the stock up 239% in 2023. Its performance is even more pronounced when considered over the past 10 years. Revenue has soared 1,480%, driving net income up 6,190%. This growth has fueled Nvidia's surging stock price, which is up more than 13,650%, with a price of $531 as of Tuesday's market close. Despite its performance, Nvidia still trades for a reasonable price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the benchmark for an inexpensive stock.\n\nThe company's most recent stock split was announced in May 2021 when the stock was trading at about $600 per share, just 13% above its current price. If things continue along the current trajectory -- and history is any indication -- it won't be long before Nvidia announces its next stock split.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is best known for its Office suite of productivity tools and ubiquitous Windows PC operating system. Last year, however, the company made a big splash in the field of generative AI. After taking a big stake in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, Microsoft released Copilot, a suite of AI-infused assistants designed to streamline mundane, time-consuming tasks. These moves kicked off the current AI arms race.\n\nStrong demand for Microsoft's AI tools helped kick-start growth for Azure Cloud, its \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure service. Not only did growth outpace its rivals in the calendar third quarter, but Microsoft also attributed three percentage points of that growth directly to demand for AI.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), Microsoft's revenue grew 13% year over year, while EPS climbed 27%. However, Copilot wasn't made available for general release until November, which means the impact hasn't yet hit the financial statements.\n\nMicrosoft has a long, distinguished track record of enviable growth, but the company's prescient AI moves helped drive the stock price up 57% in 2023. The results are even more compelling if we take a step back. Over the past decade, revenue has grown 177%, driving net income up 294%. This has pushed Microsoft's stock price higher, up nearly 817%, with a price of about $376 as of Tuesday's market close. The stock is selling for 33 times forward earnings but, considering its history, deserves a slight premium.\n\nThe company conducted nine stock splits between 1987 and 2003, rarely letting its stock price exceed $175. While Microsoft hasn't split its shares since 2003, the stock is now trading at a new all-time high of more than twice that price. And the company has only just scratched the surface of its AI opportunity, which suggests more stock price gains are ahead.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't indicated any plans for a stock split, but given its robust growth, this may be the year it joins its tech peers in splitting its high-priced shares.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\n2023 was a banner year for Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), with a number of catalysts helping lift the stock. The company's cost-cutting campaign showed dramatic results, digital advertising began to recover from its historic drought, and AI went viral. Each of these factors helped Meta regain its footing, which sent its stock up 194%.\n\nMeta's long history with AI helped the company pivot to capitalize on that expertise. Meta quickly developed Llama AI, which was released on all the major cloud services -- for a fee. Llama AI 2 was introduced late last year, and rumors suggest Llama 3 will debut in early 2024.\n\nIn the third quarter, Meta's revenue of $34.1 billion climbed 23% year over year, while its EPS of $4.39 surged 168% -- even as digital ad spending grew just 7.8% last year. As ad spending ramps back up, Meta's growth will get a boost.\n\nThen there's Advantage+, AI tools designed to empower advertisers on Meta's social media platforms. It has quickly become \"one of the fastest-growing ad products\" in Meta's history. A recent trial generated a 35% increase in return on ad spending and a 58% decrease in incremental costs per purchase. By streamlining and automating ad campaigns, Meta is simplifying the process, making it more profitable, and attracting more advertisers.\n\nMeta's growth last year was notable, but the past decade has been even more impressive. Revenue has grown by 1,260%, while net income surged 1,700%. This has fueled Meta's robust stock price gains of 493%, with the stock price of roughly $357 as of Tuesday's market close -- within 6% of a new all-time high. Not bad, considering Meta's stock is selling for a PEG ratio of less than 1.\n\nGiven its history of consistent growth and its ties to AI, 2024 could be the year Meta joins its big tech peers in conducting a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks had an absolutely smashing year in 2023.\n\nAll seven of the market's biggest tech stocks outperformed both the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500, and three of the seven stocks doubled last year. However, none performed better than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the chipmaker that has asserted itself as the clear leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nvidia's stock jumped 239% last year, and its results explain why.\n\nThe company was the clear winner in the early stages of the generative AI boom, as its revenue and profits skyrocketed last year. Revenue jumped 206% in its third quarter from the quarter a year ago, and soaring prices for its in-demand graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators have led to bumper profits. Net income on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis jumped more than 13 times from $680 million to $9.24 billion, representing a near-50% improvement to its profit margin over the equivalent quarter in the previous fiscal year.\n\nWhile you might expect Nvidia's valuation to have gotten stretched by those gains, the stock actually looks cheaper than it has in a long time because its profits have soared. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26 based on estimates for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025, and those could easily get revised higher in the coming months, as Nvidia has soared past estimates in its recent quarters.\n\nIf you're bullish on Nvidia stock, you're not alone. The average Wall Street analyst now expects the stock to jump 20% in 2024, according to TipRanks, and all the 36 analysts covering the stock expect it to gain this year. In the meantime, 32 analysts rate the stock a buy, and four call it a hold. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy Nvidia stock can keep climbing\n\nYou only need to look at Nvidia's recent product release at the CES trade show to see why the stock can keep moving higher. The company announced a slate of new products and partnerships, spanning a broad range of chip categories and industries. Overall, the news showed the company has no intention of taking its foot off the gas in the AI race and aims to extend its lead.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, the company announced a new series of GeForce RTX 40 Super GPUs to improve gaming and generative AI performance, and it's signed up gaming titans like Ubisoft and Tencent to use its new Nvidia Ace AI game-making tool.\n\nGetty Images, one of the world's biggest databases of stock photos, said it's launching a new generative AI service powered by Nvidia Picasso, an AI foundry focused on visual design. Nvidia's technology will allow anyone to create 4K imagery from text with an AI model that's been trained on Getty Images' catalog of photos.\n\nFinally, the chip giant said that biotech company Amgen is using Nvidia's DGX SuperPOD to train state-of-the-art models to help accelerate drug discovery and development.\n\nThere's no shortage of applications for Nvidia's chips, as the advent of generative AI has implications for nearly every industry and business. Nvidia's technology is even being used in the retail industry to help prevent organized theft and for personalized shopping advice.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is also challenging Intel with three new chips for AI PCs, pushing back against a company expected to challenge Nvidia in AI.\n\nIs Nvidia a buy?\n\nNvidia's series of announcements at CES and comments from the likes of Oracle and OpenAI about a severe shortage of AI components (from Nvidia) show that the generative AI boom is only getting started.\n\nConsidering that the stock trades at a P/E ratio in line with the broad market, based on the coming year's earnings, the stock looks like a no-brainer buy right now.\n\nIf generative AI is here to stay, which nearly every tech CEO believes it is, Nvidia stock could still have a lot of room to run higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Forget AI, Nvidia's Next Big Catalyst Might Be Nintendo's Switch",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock quadrupled over the past three years as the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market lit a fire under its data center business. Its high-end GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks, and most of the world's leading AI companies -- including ChatGPT's creator OpenAI -- currently use its chips.\n\nBut as the AI hype winds down, many investors are likely wondering if Nvidia can maintain its momentum. The AI market should continue to expand, but investors shouldn't ignore another potential catalyst for Nvidia's stock in 2024: Nintendo's (OTC: NTDOY) rumored launch of its next Switch console. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe relationship between Nvidia and Nintendo\n\nNintendo has sold 132.5 million Switch consoles (including the original, Lite, and OLED versions) since its launch in 2017, making it the best-selling gaming console in the world. By comparison, Sony has sold an estimated 117.2 million PS4s since 2013 and 15.8 million PS5 since 2020, while Microsoft has sold 58 million Xbox Ones since 2013 and 25.4 million Xbox Series S and X consoles since 2020.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch is less powerful than Sony and Microsoft's consoles, but it gained a loyal following with its hybrid form factor (it can be used both as a handheld and a docked system) and its large library of exclusive first-party games.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch runs on Nvidia's Tegra X1 system on a chip (SoC), which the chipmaker previously installed in its own Shield tablet and Android TV devices. The Arm-based Tegra isn't a graphical powerhouse like the custom Advanced Micro Devices APUs that power Sony and Microsoft's latest consoles, but it gives the Switch the mobility and power efficiency of a high-end smartphone or gaming tablet.\n\nNvidia reported its Tegra chip sales separately until fiscal 2020 (which ended in January 2020). During that year, it generated $1.45 billion in revenue, or 13% of its top line, from its Tegra chips (which include its gaming SoCs, automotive chips, and embedded AI chips) -- but that represented a 6% drop from fiscal 2019. It mainly attributed that decline to its slower sales of gaming SoCs, which partly offset its rising sales of automotive chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nStarting in fiscal 2021, Nvidia stopped disclosing its Tegra sales and bundled them into its newly created \"graphics\" segment -- which also houses its GeForce gaming GPUs, Quadro workstation GPUs, automotive chips, and cloud-based services. That reorganization preceded Nintendo's declining shipments of Switch consoles -- which declined 20% in fiscal 2022 (ended in March 2022) and dropped another 22% in fiscal 2023.\n\nIt's time for a major upgrade\n\nNintendo's Switch sales declined for three reasons. First, it faced tough comparisons to the pandemic in 2020, which brought new players to the console with hit games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Second, the Switch had largely saturated its core market and was showing its age. That's why its OLED upgrade in 2021 disappointed a lot of gamers and investors who had expected a brand new console. Lastly, the persistent supply chain constraints exacerbated all that pressure.\n\nHowever, a series of recent rumors suggested Nintendo would finally launch its long-awaited \"Switch 2\" this year. Most of these reports claim the console will be powered by a next-gen Nvidia Tegra SoC, which adds support for 4K gaming along with the DLSS (deep learning super sampling) features that are currently exclusive to its top-tier RTX gaming GPUs for PCs.\n\nWe should take those rumors with a grain of salt, but there's likely a lot of pent-up demand for a new Nintendo console. Therefore, the arrival of the Switch 2 could significantly boost Nvidia's Tegra sales this year and coincide with the broader recovery of the PC market -- which is finally stabilizing after a slowdown in 2022 and 2023. If that happens, Nvidia's gaming sales, which accounted for 16% of its top line in its latest quarter, could rise and offset a potential slowdown in its data center sales, which brought in 80% of its revenue but still relies heavily on the expansion of the red-hot AI market.\n\nNvidia's investors should look beyond the AI market\n\nNvidia has never publicly disclosed the price tag of its Tegra chips for Nintendo, but the general consensus is around $30 per device for the initial batch of chips. So assuming the next Tegra chip costs roughly the same and Nintendo sells another 130 million Switch 2 consoles, it could potentially translate to $3 billion to $4 billion in long-term sales for Nvidia.\n\nThat's all speculation for now, but it's still a meaningful figure for a chipmaker expected to generate $58.9 billion in sales this fiscal year. The Tegra certainly won't generate as much revenue as its data center or gaming GPUs, but I believe the launch of the Switch 2 might just give the bulls a fresh reason to buy Nvidia's high-flying stock this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. is off to its strongest-ever start to a year by one measure, keeping up a blistering rally that saw shares gain nearly 240% in 2023.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Shutter 121-Person San Diego AI Team in Reorganization Biden Says US Doesn’t Support Taiwan Independence After Vote Taiwan Elects US-Friendly President, Defying China Warnings Bill Ackman Is Bringing Activist Playbook to America’s Culture Wars\n\nThe artificial-intelligence darling has added roughly $128 billion in market capitalization after rising about 10% this month, an unprecedented gain in value in the first nine trading days of the year for the company.\n\nIt’s a boon for Nvidia bulls and signals that the AI trend still has momentum, at least for the firm viewed by many as one of the biggest early winners. Nvidia this year is easily outpacing the broader market and the rest of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks. That’s making it a major bright spot as the S&P 500 Index has stalled near record highs amid questions around corporate profits and the timing of anticipated Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.\n\n“From my standpoint, Nvidia is best of breed,” said Shana Sissel, chief executive officer of Banrion Capital Management LLC, adding that it’s dominant in its marketplace, has strong customer relationships and is growing fast. “It’s hard to find a lot of holes in the story.”\n\nRead more: Nvidia Is Soaring Again as 3-Day Rally Hits 11%: Tech Watch\n\nNvidia had a better start on a percentage basis last year, to kick off its record rally. To be fair, those gains came after the stock lost half its value in 2022. For the next 12 months, analysts covering Nvidia have an average target price of almost $650, indicating roughly 19% upside for a company that now has a market capitalization greater than $1.3 trillion.\n\nThe CES trade show this month solidified confidence for proponents of Nvidia shares.

        "title": "The 2 Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms, and Tesla. They earned that moniker because of their incredible valuations and far-reaching impact on different areas of the technology sector, and they have delivered incredible returns over the last year.\n\nCrucially, each of these companies also has big advantages in artificial intelligence (AI) and massive opportunities to benefit from it over the long term. But while each of the Magnificent Seven should benefit from some AI-related performance catalysts, some will necessarily perform better than others.\n\nIf you're looking for top ways to benefit from the AI revolution, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors identified Nvidia and Alphabet as the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2024 and beyond.\n\nIncredible momentum and massive opportunities\n\nKeith Noonan (Nvidia): With gains of roughly 238% over the last year, Nvidia has performed better than any other Magnificent Seven stock -- and there are good reasons to think that its incredible run will continue. Demand for Nvidia's high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) has soared in tandem with demand for AI services. Thanks to this catalyst, the company's sales and earnings have shot through the roof.\n\nIn the third quarter, the chipmaker posted sales of $18.12 billion, up 206% year over year. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share soared 593% compared to the prior-year period.\n\nThe company even expects sales growth to accelerate significantly in the fourth quarter. With guidance for sales of roughly $20 billion in the period, management's target calls for year-over-year growth of roughly 230%. And the GPU leader has crushed its own guidance and Wall Street's performance targets over the last year.\n\nThe business has gone from being centered around GPUs for the consumer markets to focusing on processors for data centers used by large organizations. Data center hardware will likely remain the key foundation of its business, but the AI leader might be in the early stages of a new transformation.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia already has the foundations to be the most important hardware provider for enterprise AI applications, but it's moving to bolster its own recurring-revenue base with subscription services. It's rolling out new AI-focused software and offering computations for AI apps as a service.\n\nAs the company increases the software and services component of its business, it should see strong sales and margin tailwinds. These new growth drivers and its already stellar performance make Nvidia stock still look like a great buy in 2024.\n\nMagnificent, to be sure\n\nParkev Tatevosian (Alphabet): My top Magnificent Seven stock for 2024 is Google parent Alphabet, which has an excellent business model that generates billions in revenue and profits, and sells at a relatively cheap valuation.\n\nIndeed, Alphabet's sales expanded from $56 billion in 2013 to $283 billion in 2022. The company generates revenue primarily from advertising and has benefited as marketers have been transitioning their ads to digital channels.\n\nLegacy ads were hard to target with any precision, and exact measurements of results were nearly impossible with billboards, newspapers, and magazines. (How many people saw your billboard on Sunset Boulevard? Who knows?)\n\nBut online, businesses can target their ads more precisely and see how many people clicked on their messages and made a purchase. GOOG PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nThe business has been lucrative. Alphabet's operating income soared from $15 billion to $75 billion in the years shown above. The industry is unlikely to reverse course, which could lead to growing profitability for Alphabet for several years. Although it's unlikely to grow at the rate it achieved in the previous decade.\n\nStill, that could already be reflected in Alphabet's attractive valuation. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6, a bargain given the company's dominant position in a lucrative industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Nvidia Next?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has split its stock five times since 2000. The most recent split was July 2021, when the company issued a 4-for-1 stock split -- meaning shareholders received four shares for every one share they held.\n\nStock splits are not free shares and don't change the overall value of the company. The main benefit of a stock split is that it makes a company's shares more affordable, and therefore more available to be purchased by a wider base of investors, especially those who can't buy fractional shares through their broker.\n\nMany investors may want to invest in Nvidia but may not be able to afford to buy a single share after last year's performance. The shares soared 239% in 2023 and currently sit at $531. The last time Nvidia split its stock, the shares were trading at $748 -- a post-split price of $187.\n\nNvidia shares may only get more expensive in 2024. Here's why Nvidia is positioned to have another big year of growth, and why that increases the chance of another stock split.\n\nWhy 2024 should be another banner year for Nvidia\n\nThe demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts. In the fiscal third quarter, revenue more than tripled compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by demand for its H100 data center GPU. Competition will heat up this year from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel in the AI chip market, but Nvidia continues to plow more resources into innovation that has major corporate customers lining up to install its new chips in their data centers. Nvidia total revenue compared to data center revenue.\n\nIn November, Nvidia announced the new H200 chip, which is specifically designed to process massive amounts of data to train large language models for generative AI applications, among other advanced computing needs. Nvidia says the H200 is twice as fast as the H100 for AI inferencing, the process by which computers learn to make predictions on their own from new data.\n\nNvidia said that cloud service providers drove about half of its data center revenue in fiscal Q3. Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud are already on board to offer H200-powered AI processing to their customers next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to slow in the near term, it's still going to put up strong double-digit growth rates. Not only is it selling every chip it makes, but management mentioned on the November earnings call that it would expand its offering and release new products faster to meet growing demand across a range of AI opportunities.\n\nWhy a stock split could come sooner rather than later\n\nNvidia has strong relationships with all of the major cloud service providers. Its innovation and long history of specializing in GPU development means it can price its chips at a premium. This is bolstering Nvidia's profit margin and fueling robust earnings growth. While analysts expect Nvidia to post revenue growth of 56% this year, earnings per share are projected to increase by 66%.\n\nThose estimates would represent a significant slowdown from the triple-digit growth rates we've seen in recent quarters. But the stock could still be a bargain.\n\nNvidia shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 25 times next year's earnings estimate. That's less than half the growth of the company's earnings, which is usually a good signal that a growth stock is undervalued.\n\nGrowing demand for AI chips should keep Nvidia in growth mode. A relatively modest valuation sets the stage for the share price to move higher, and therefore increases the chances of another split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Forget C3.ai: Buy This Killer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "There's a strong argument that 2023 was the year that artificial intelligence (AI) came of age, sparking a market recovery in the process. After plunging 35% in 2022, the Nasdaq Composite rebounded with a vengeance last year, gaining 43%.\n\nWhile AI has been around for decades, recent advances in the field of generative AI have been a game changer. This breakthrough technology can, among other things, create original text and images based on a few user prompts. But that's just the beginning. These sophisticated algorithms can search company databases and the internet for information, summarize emails and draft responses, recap meetings, create presentations from available data, and even write and review computer code. The resulting productivity advances are expected to be worth trillions of dollars, and companies are scrambling to capture their share of this windfall.\n\nInvestors, too, are looking to profit from this trend, snatching up any stock they can in the field of AI. While that's certainly understandable, not all AI stocks are created equal. One high-profile example is C3.ai(NYSE: AI). The stock soared more than 156% last year, driven by the excitement surrounding AI. A review of the evidence, however, suggests there's a better way for investors to profit from the AI revolution -- one that provides much more upside potential. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for (and against) C3.ai\n\nInvestors' attraction to this stock isn't surprising given C3.ai's eponymous ticker, but looks can be deceiving. The company bills itself as a \"leading enterprise AI software provider for building enterprise-scale AI applications.\" Management goes on to point out that the company \"provides over 40 turnkey enterprise AI applications that meet the business-critical needs of global enterprises,\" serving a number of business and industry verticals.\n\nThis would seem to suggest that C3.ai would be well situated to benefit from the AI gold rush. However, the company's business performance is lackluster at best.\n\nStory continues\n\nC3.ai's recent financial results held more questions than answers. During its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), C3.ai delivered revenue that grew 17% year over year to $3.2 million, resulting in a loss per share of $0.59, barely improved from the $0.63-per-share loss it generated in the year-ago period. This is particularly troubling given the mad dash to adopt AI over the past year should have dramatically boosted C3.ai's fortunes. But that simply hasn't been the case. Furthermore, the company continues to burn cash, with free cash flow of negative $55.1 million.\n\nTo be fair, C3.ai is making some progress, boasting of \"a return to accelerating revenue growth,\" though the numbers are hardly inspiring. \"We have seen top-line year-over-year revenue growth increase from -4% in Q3 FY23, to 0% in Q4 FY23, to 11% in Q1 FY24, to 17% in Q2 FY24,\" said CEO Thomas Siebel.\n\nHowever, its forecast suggests that trend may be over, as management is calling for fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue of $76 million at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent year-over-year growth of 14%, while its operating losses will continue to mount. Despite its tepid results and weak outlook, the stock sells for 11 times sales, and with not even the suggestion of profitability on the horizon.\n\nIn the face of unprecedented adoption of AI, C3.ai should be scrambling to meet the burgeoning demand. Given its lackluster performance thus far, investors would do better looking elsewhere to profit from AI.\n\nA much better AI play\n\nThe breakout beneficiary of the AI boom thus far has been Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and the evidence suggests the trend will continue. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) were originally designed to generate lifelike images in video games but have evolved over time.\n\nThe secret to its success is parallel processing, which takes massive, computationally intensive tasks and breaks them up into bite-sized bits, allowing it to perform a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. Researchers and scientists found this provided the computational horsepower necessary to accelerate AI tasks.\n\nRivals have tried to unseat Nvidia from its position as the industry leader, but those efforts have thus far proven unsuccessful. If you have any doubts, consider this: Nvidia is the leading provider of processors used for machine learning, an earlier, more established branch of AI, according to data supplied by New Street Research. It also maintains an estimated 95% share of the GPUs used in the data center market -- where most business-centric AI lives -- according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. While the field of generative AI is still in its infancy, it stands to reason that Nvidia will control an equally dominant share of the market. As evidence, there's been a run on Nvidia AI chips that shows no signs of slowing.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), Nvidia generated record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $3.71 soared 1,274%. Management left no doubt the surging demand was the result of the rapid adoption of AI.\n\nFor its fiscal fourth quarter, Nvidia forecast all-time high revenue of roughly $20 billion, representing growth of 231% year over year and 10% sequentially.\n\nA quick look at its valuation shows that Nvidia stock is remarkably inexpensive. For a high-growth stock like this, the most appropriate valuation metric is the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. For Nvidia, this clocks in at less than 1 -- the benchmark for an undervalued stock, compared to 2 for the S&P 500, which shows just how cheap it really is by comparison.\n\nThe evidence clearly shows that Nvidia is a much better AI stock than C3.ai.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in C3.ai right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and C3.ai wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Hidden High-Yielders: 7 Overlooked Stocks with Attractive Dividends",
        "content": "If you’re a growth investor, an article about overlooked high-yield dividend stocks is not for you. However, with the recent numbers showing that inflation is that dinner party guest that is overstaying its welcome, you may not want to dismiss income-generating stocks too quickly.\n\nNow, if you’re still with me, I’ll also say that this I’m not recommending that you find the dividend stocks with the highest dividend yields and be done with it.\n\nWhile high-yield dividend stocks are attractive, they’re only one part of a stock’s total return. Not only do you want to ensure that a company’s dividend is safe (and preferably growing), but you also want to buy shares of a company that are going to deliver reasonable capital gains to go along with that dividend.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, if you’re looking to own stocks for the long haul, you’re going to have to deal with a bad year here and there. But over time, owning quality high-yield dividend stocks is a solid strategy for building wealth.\n\nCompanies that pay dividends are often blue-chip companies that are at a mature stage in their business cycle. This means they deliver predictable, some may say boring, revenue and earnings. But boring can quickly become beautiful when it’s time for those dividends to be paid.\n\nHere are seven overlooked high-yield dividend stocks for you to consider in 2024.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve recommended Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and it may not be the last. PFE stock is a no-go for many investors based on reasons that have nothing to do with the company’s fundamentals. Fair enough, every investor needs to know where their line is.\n\nAnd from a total return standpoint, Pfizer has been a tough hold. The stock is down 38.9% in the last 12 months. The reason is simple. The record revenue and earnings per share (EPS) growth the company saw in 2021 and 2022 has normalized. Faced with tougher comps in 2023, Pfizer couldn’t deliver.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the company reported 7% growth in revenue from its non-Covid products in the third quarter. And, Pfizer projects full-year revenue growth for those products between 6%-8%.\n\nBeyond its current portfolio, Pfizer has a strong pipeline backed by $7.9 billion in internal reserarch and development spending. The pipeline includes many drugs and therapeutics centered around the concept of precision medicine, which focuses on the biological basis of diseases.\n\nPfizer is expected to post 45% earnings growth in the next 12 months. Still PFE stock trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18x. Investors also get a dividend that has been growing for 14 consecutive years and has a juicy 5.91% yield.\n\nPhilip Morris International (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.\n\nSource: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext on this list of overlooked high-yield dividend stocks is Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). One reason why the company may be overlooked is that it’s in the category of equities loosely labeled sin stocks.\n\nAs you consider the bullish case for Philip Morris, think to the electric vehicle (EV) industry. While this industry has its startups, the legacy automakers weren’t going to allow this threat to their business to emerge without getting a seat at the table.\n\nIn the same way, Philip Morris is a key player in the smokeless tobacco categories. Traditional nicotine products continue to have a place in the company’s portfolio. But an increasing amount of revenue is coming from smoke-free products. In its third quarter 2023 earnings report, that category was responsible for 36% of the company’s revenue.\n\nThat’s why no matter how you look at it, or disagree with it, Philip Morris is an exceptional defensive stock. PM stock is down 7% in the last 12 months, but analysts are expecting a 15% recovery in the company’s share price. And investors get a juicy dividend that currently yields 5.50% and has increased for 16 consecutive years.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) Albuquerque, New Mexico / USA - November 2 2020: Boxes of Band-Aids in Walmart in the pharmacy and over-the-counter medication aisle. Kenvue (KVUE) split from JNJ and now owns the Band-aid brand.\n\nSource: Giovanni Nastukov / Shutterstock.com\n\nKenvue (NYSE:KVUE) is the former consumer products division of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The company formally spun off from J&J in May and began publicly trading at that time. The early returns have been underwhelming with the stock down 18%.\n\nNevertheless, Kenvue represents the most defensive sector of its former parent company’s portfolio with brand names like Band-Aid, Listerine, and Tylenol. Those popular brands are literally household names and staple items in medicine cabinets.\n\nBut should you buy the stock? Earnings are expected to be flat to slightly lower. But analysts have a sense that the sell-off may be overdone. They assign KVUE stock with a $24.27 consensus price target which is 10% higher than the price as of this writing.\n\nAnd then there’s the dividend which currently has a yield of 3.65%. For now, ratings agencies are giving Kenvue a halo effect from Johnson & Johnson. The stock gets mostly ‘A’ ratings as analysts expect that Kenvue management won’t depart from J&J’s emphasis on the dividend.\n\nChevron (CVX) chevron stock\n\nSource: LesPalenik / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe fall rally in oil prices reversed sharply in the last two months of 2023, and with it went the share price of oil stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX). The energy sector in general disappointed investors in 2023. In fact, CVX stock earned the dubious distinction of being one of the Dogs of the Dow in 2023.\n\nTo be fair, there are many factors that can impact the direction of oil prices. However, despite the state of interest rates, oil prices have been ticking higher. If the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, for whatever reason, it will be exceptionally bullish for oil.\n\nBut won’t that just be a rising tide that lifts all oil stocks? The experts are projecting earnings per share for companies in the oil and gas industry will rise at an average rate of 6.3% for the next 12 months. However, Chevron is expected to grow earnings by over 16% and analysts give CVX stock a consensus price target of $177.61 which is a 22% gain.\n\nIn addition to that sector-beating performance, Chevron is a dividend aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 36 consecutive years. The dividend currently has a yield of 4.16%.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) clocks in with a dividend yield of 4.07%. And in 2023, that was the only comfort that investors got from owning UPS stock. Shares of the delivery giant are down 11.5% in the last 12 months. The company faced tough comparisons to 2022. A labor dispute didn’t help matters as some customers took their business elsewhere.\n\nBut the stock has been trending higher along with the broader market. The company has taken cost-cutting measures and is projecting earnings growth of over 6.8% in the next 12 months. Analysts give the share price about a 5% upside. And on Jan. 10, Stifel Nicolaus reiterated its Buy rating on the stock while bumping its price target to $190.\n\nThat’s more exciting. However, for UPS Stock to hit that number, you’re betting on the consumer to stay strong. The December CPI number showed that inflation won’t go quietly, but it also provides some evidence that the consumer continues to spend.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree.

That includes stocks like Nvidia (NYSE:NVDA) which may continue to be a great stock.\n\nBut as Josh Enomoto explained to InvestorPlace readers, Nvidia may be many things, but it’s not part of the overlooked high-yield dividend stocks club. So, if you’ve stuck with me to this point, you may find International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) to be an interesting choice.\n\nOne reason for that is, ironically, AI. Many investors don’t realize that IBM has been involved in the area of machine learning long before ChatGPT caught the attention of students across the globe. And the company’s recent announcement of its Quantum System Two computer has the opportunity to leap frog the company into a prominent position in the AI space.\n\nThat being said, IBM is the only stock on this list that is forecast to have a lower stock price in the next 12 months. But with a dividend that yields over 4% you get a nice benefit while you wait on the stock to move higher.\n\nArmour Residential REIT (ARR) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nFor many investors, finding high-yield dividend stocks means looking at monthly dividend payers. And that means real estate investment trusts (REITs). Armour Residential REIT (NYSE:ARR) is one of the more intriguing names to look for in 2024.\n\nBut it’s not without risk. The company is a mortgage REIT (mREIT) that’s primary revenue is derived from buying government agency securities on people’s mortgages. The environment for mREITs has been terrible to say the least as interest rates have moved higher because the value of existing loans – the kind that Armour buys – is lower.\n\nThomas Niel explains why the company’s current dividend yield of over 24% may not be sustainable. But REITs are still required to pay at least 90% of their earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. In 2023, the amount the company is paying in dividends still exceeds the company’s net loss on paper.\n\nThat may be a simplistic way of looking at things, but when you’re considering investing in a REIT, it’s all about the dividend. Armour looks like a good choice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock increased significantly by 19% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:\n\n57% = US$19b ÷ US$33b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.57 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nNVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 57% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that NVIDIA has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, NVIDIA's considerable five year net income growth of 28% was to be expected.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 30% in the same 5-year period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about NVIDIA's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs NVIDIA Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nNVIDIA's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 5.4% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (95%) of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.\n\nMoreover, NVIDIA is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 0.6% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 71% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with NVIDIA's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

        "content": "After falling more than 25% in 2022, the stock market came roaring back in 2023, and history suggests there's more to come. The S&P 500 closed just shy of its all-time high as of market close on Tuesday. When it does finally hit a new record high, that event combined with a more than 20% increase from its recent low will mark the start of the next bull market.\n\nSo why does it matter? Well, since 1957, bull markets on average have lasted nearly five years, rewarding investors with average gains of just over 169%. Going back to the beginning of trading for the Nasdaq Composite in 1972, history shows that in every year following a market recovery, the tech-centric index has generated average annual gains of 19%.\n\nThe economy is generally unpredictable, so things could still get worse before they get better, but the historical data suggests a good year is ahead for investors.\n\nThere are many reasons to buy a stock, and many of them include the expectation that the stock will ultimately make investors money. One of those reasons is a bull market tends to benefit a lot of stocks. Here are my top 10 growth stocks to buy for 2024 before the bull market charges ahead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nA significant decline in digital advertising in 2022 and a pause in the growth of cloud spending hit Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) hard, but the improving economy is sparking a rebound. Google remains the global search leader, the world's largest online advertiser, and a \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure provider, which will continue to buoy its fortunes.\n\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst will be Alphabet's efforts involving artificial intelligence (AI). Alphabet recently rolled out Gemini, a program it claims is the most advanced generative AI system yet. It also offers more than 100 prebuilt AI models via Google Cloud and custom tools to make users more productive.\n\nThis gives Alphabet multiple catalysts to boost its stock in 2024. Trading at 4 times forward sales, the stock is historically cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nEconomic headwinds, led by soaring inflation, weighed heavily on Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2022, but green shoots of growth are appearing across its vast operations. Digital retail is bouncing back, and AI is boosting cloud spending, fueling its two largest growth areas.\n\nThe company has also planted its stake in AI, providing cloud customers with all the top generative AI models via Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company continues to integrate AI into every aspect of its operations, improving productivity along the way.\n\nThe twin tailwinds of an improving economy and AI will drive Alphabet higher. Trading at just 2 times forward sales, the stock is a steal.\n\n3. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) is likely the least well-known company on this list. It's the leading provider of e-commerce and digital payments services in Latin America, and business is brisk. In the third quarter, revenue climbed 69%, while operating income surged 194% -- despite generating record-setting growth last year.\n\nThis trend is expected to continue. The adoption of e-commerce in the region is among the fastest in the world, and with a population of nearly 668 million, it's twice the size of the U.S., so its pool of potential customers is much larger.\n\nAdd to that MercadoLibre's margin expansion and strong cash flow, and investors shouldn't sleep on this Latin American powerhouse.\n\n4. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) suffered from the same headwinds as its tech rivals but responded by kicking off the AI gold rush with a $13 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. What followed was a flurry of activity, integrating generative AI tools across its suite of products and services and AI cloud offerings. Its AI-fueled digital assistant Copilot is seeing robust demand, the headliner in the \"fastest-growing $10 billion business\" in Microsoft's history.\n\nThe demand is unmistakable. Microsoft's Azure cloud revenue growth outpaced rivals in the calendar third quarter, with three percentage points of that growth attributable to demand for AI.\n\nThe stock is selling for 32 times forward earnings, particularly reasonable in light of its prospects.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) processors have long been the gold standard for gaming, data center, and artificial intelligence (AI) use cases, capitalizing on the generative AI boom that hit last year. The resulting shortage of AI chips is expected to persist through 2024. Nvidia ramped up production to meet the accelerating demand and continues pouring money into research and development, creating ever-improving solutions.\n\nThe company has generated triple-digit year-over-year revenue and profit growth in each of the past two quarters, and soaring demand for AI is expected to continue. Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 is cheaper than the broader market, making this stock a steal.\n\n6. Palantir Technologies\n\nWith decades of experience under its belt, Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) was ready when AI went viral last year. The company quickly pivoted, adding generative AI models to its repertoire, which work hand in hand with Palantir's AI-powered data analytics. The resulting Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has generated robust interest, and management said, \"Demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past 20 years.\"\n\nThe stock might seem pricey at 11 times forward sales, but with four successive quarters of profitability, Palantir is \"eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500,\" management noted on the company's recent earnings call. As one of the few pure-play AI stocks out there, Palantir is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI gold rush.\n\n7. Roku\n\nDespite a punishing couple of years, Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) remains the world's most widely used streaming platform, with 51% of the market. The dearth of ad spending last year has begun to lift, and with multiple viewers across its 76 million active accounts, it's a compelling opportunity advertisers can't ignore, fueling ad growth on its platform.\n\nFurthermore, the secular tailwinds of cord-cutting and the deterioration of broadcast viewing have caused an ongoing advertising shift from broadcast to streaming. Roku is the one place to reach these highly engaged viewers, who consumed 26.7 billion hours, or roughly 3.9 hours per day. And at roughly 3 times forward sales, investors are getting a bargain.\n\n8. Shopify\n\nWith the downturn largely in the rearview mirror, things are looking up for Shopify(NYSE: SHOP). E-commerce spending has returned to growth, and as the leading provider of software tools for online merchants, Shopify is positioned to thrive. The company released new generative AI tools to help sellers prosper and it has a minority stake in Global-e Online, which helps merchants expand into international markets.\n\nShopify streamlined its operations last year, trimming staff and shedding its logistics business to focus on its mission to empower digital retailers. This has fueled strong growth and profitability, making Shopify a compelling opportunity for investors.\n\n9. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has a reputation as a battleground stock, but it continues to defy detractors. Last year, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car by a comfortable margin, a first for an electric vehicle. Despite headwinds and price adjustments -- which led to temporary profit declines -- the company continued to drive further into the automotive mainstream.\n\nWith inflation cooling and interest rates expected to drop next year, conditions will be much more favorable for Tesla. This could help the company return to its long-term production goal of 50% annual growth while also helping expand its profit margins.\n\nFinally, 5 times forward sales is a pretty reasonable valuation, especially considering the stock price gains of more than 2,300% over the past decade.\n\n10. The Trade Desk\n\nSome investors were surprised by the impact the aforementioned decline in marketing spending in 2022 had on The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD). The company's self-service digital advertising platform actually took market share from the walled gardens, including Alphabet and Meta Platforms, notching growth even as its rivals suffered year-over-year revenue declines.\n\nLate last year, CEO Jeff Green said, \"Over the last few quarters ... we have gained more market share than in any other period in our company's history.\" The Trade Desk's recently released Koa AI copilot should fuel this trend, helping advertisers get the most out of their ad campaigns.\n\nFinally, with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the standard for an underpriced stock -- the Trade Desk is a compelling bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the16 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.\n\nLatest data shows that more and more Americans are investing in stocks, a trend that started during the COVID-19 pandemic days. In December, a Wall Street Journal report cited data from the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances which said that about 58% of U.S. households owned stocks in 2022, up from 53% in 2019. This was the highest household stock-ownership rate recorded in the survey that is conducted after every three years. This data shows that the rise of individual investors seen after the pandemic was not a temporary trend. As millions of Americans received stimulus checks during the pandemic days, they turned to retail investing platforms like Robinhood and other investing apps to pile into stocks. That trend is still going on despite the massive decline in stocks seen in 2022 following the inflation storm and rate hikes.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we used Robinhood Investor Index (which shows the most popular stocks on the investing platform Robinhood), some research reports and screeners highlighting the most popular stocks among individual investors to find out 16 most widely held stocks among individual investors. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals\n\nPhoto by Chris Liverani on Unsplash\n\n16. Sphere 3D Corp (NASDAQ:ANY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 1\n\nSphere 3D Corp (NASDAQ:ANY) is one of the most popular stocks among individual investors, according to Fintel Retail Ownership stock screener. The carbon neutral bitcoin mining company Sphere 3D Corp (NASDAQ:ANY) said it mined 73.5 bitcoins in December, higher than 71.7 bitcoins mined in November and 17.9 bitcoins in the year-ago month.\n\n15. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 9\n\nMany data platforms tracking retail investor activity show GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) continues to be one of the most widely held stocks by individual investors. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) has fallen from its glory days when it skyrocketed thanks to the short squeeze launched by retail investors on Reddit. The stock has lost about 14% in value over the past one year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.00, beating estimates by $0.08. Revenue in the quarter fell 9.2% year over year to $1.08 billion, missing estimates by $100 million.\n\nIn addition to stocks like GameStop, individual investors are also buying mega-cap tech stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\n14. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) ranks 14th in our list of the stocks widely held by individual investors. In November, the entertainment company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) posted strong third quarter results thanks to Barbie and Oppenheimer.\n\nAdjusted EPS in the quarter came in at -$0.09, beating estimates by $0.16. Revenue in the period jumped 45.2% year over year to $1.41 billion, beating estimates by $150 million.\n\n13. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nChinese EV company Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) ranks 13th in our list of the stocks widely held by individuals. According to data from Robinhood, Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) is amongst the most popular stocks on the platform.\n\nEarlier this month, BofA Securities downgraded the stock to Neutral. BofA said lack of new models in the first half of 2024 will affect company sales.\n\n12. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) is one of the most popular stocks among retail investors. Hedge fund sentiment for the automaker also inched up in the third quarter of 2023, as 43 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F), up from 40 hedge funds in the previous quarter.\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) sold 25,937 electric cars in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was up 24% on a YoY basis.\n\n11. Invesco QQQ ETF\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nInvesco QQQ ETF tracks the NASDAQ-100 index and gives investors exposure to some of the top technology and growth stocks. Over the past few years it has become one of the most famous ETFs among individual investors.\n\n10. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains one of the most favorite stocks of individual investors. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) produced 494,989 vehicles and delivered over 484,507 vehicles, beating estimates of 483,000 deliveries.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). The most notable stakeholder of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was Catherine D. Wood's ARK Investment Management which owns a stake worth over $1 billion.\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it's relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.\"\n\n9. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 82\n\nThere has been an increase in popularity of broader market ETFs and index funds among individual investors especially after the inflation storm and rate hikes.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is among the most held ETFs by individual investors.\n\n8. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 89\n\nAccording to Robinhood index tracker, Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most popular stocks on the Robinhood platform.\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) has been seeing a lot of activity in the hedge fund space as it prepares to enter a battle with Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners. Peltz is seeking two board seats at Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS).\n\nActivist hedge fund Blackwells Capital will nominate three directors to Walt Disney Co’s (NYSE:DIS) board in support of Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and ValueAct Capital Management recently entered an agreement according to which Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) will provide information to the investment firm and consult with ValueAct on strategic matters, including through meetings with the Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) Board and management.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).  The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.\"\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has made a comeback against NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) by launching new chips for AI and the company plans to continue to up its AI game.\n\nWells Fargo analysts led by Aaron Rakers earlier this month said in a note that they like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the current levels as they believe the semiconductor industry is set for a rebound.\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD's data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company's AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD's product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD's inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock's strong performance run, led us to trim the position.\"\n\n6. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 180\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has seen a huge rise in popularity among retail and institutional investors amid the AI boom. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 234% over the past one year, with many analysts repeatedly saying there’s a lot more room to run for the stock because of a burgeoning demand for AI chips.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, hedge funds and retail investors are piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\n\n\"Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those three stocks, as well as Microsoft, were among the leading contributors to Strategy performance for the quarter. Microsoft and Nvidia continued to be supported by strong execution and leadership positions in the implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThese are high-quality, cash flow generative businesses that we will continue to own, actively adjusting our positioning sizes based on risk/reward and portfolio construction priorities. With Nvidia shares more than tripling in 2023, we opportunistically took profits throughout the year, an approach that continued in the fourth quarter with additional trims that brought the position down to 6% of overall assets.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.\"\n\nClick to continue reading and see 16 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Analysts 11 Most Promising Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks According to Analysts 16 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 41% and 111% in 2024, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Data centers are physical locations where companies keep computing infrastructure like servers, network equipment, and data storage solutions. They come in different shapes and sizes, but cloud data centers have become particularly popular over the last decade. Cloud computing allows businesses to provision hardware and software services instantly, without spending a lot of money upfront.\n\nCountless companies have capitalized on that IT reshuffling, but few have benefited more than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Nvidia chips have become key data center accelerators for workloads like artificial intelligence (AI), and Amazon is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services. Critical positioning in a booming industry drove both stocks higher. Nvidia returned 12,800% during the last decade and Amazon returned 630%.\n\nThat substantial price appreciation led both companies to split their stocks somewhat recently:\n\nNvidia: 4-for-1 split July 2021. Amazon: 20-for-1 split in June 2022.\n\nCertain Wall Street analysts see big gains for shareholders in 2024. Specifically, Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt has a 12-month price target on Nvidia of $1,100 per share, implying a 111% upside from its current price. Similarly, Scott Devitt at Wedbush Securities has a 12-month price target on Amazon of $210 per share, implying a 41% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has three primary growth engines in its gaming, professional visualization, and data center businesses, though the automotive segment could become a substantial source of revenue as the robotaxi market blossoms.\n\nNvidia has deep roots in gaming and professional visualization. Its invention of the GPU (graphics processing unit) in 1999 revolutionized computer graphics, and the company still holds more than 90% market share in workstation graphics processors. But Nvidia also added monetization opportunities by branching into software with Omniverse, a suite of applications that support 3D design and virtual simulation. The latter is useful in training machine learning models for autonomous robots and self-driving cars.\n\nStory continues\n\nGuided by visionary CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia moved into data centers in 2006 when it introduced the CUDA programming model, turning its GPUs into general-purpose processors. That innovation laid the foundation for tremendous success. Today, Nvidia dominates the market for data center accelerators and machine learning chips. In fact, Forrester Research has said Nvidia GPUs are synonymous with AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann highlighted adjacent AI monetization opportunities in data center networking and software. To elaborate, networking sales tripled over the past year to become a $10 billion business, and CEO Jensen Huang says it will get much larger. Similarly, CFO Colette Kress says Nvidia started to see excellent adoption of AI software during the most recent quarter, an encouraging update, given that management sees it as a $150 billion market opportunity.\n\nHere's the bottom line: GPU sales are projected to increase by 28% annually through 2030, while the AI market is projected to expand by 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at 25% annual sales growth through the end of the decade. Despite that, its present valuation of 29 times sales looks a little pricey, especially when the three-year average is 23.5 times sales.\n\nInvestors comfortable with volatility can buy a small position today, provided they are willing to hold the stock for at least five years. The triple-digit return baked into Rosenblatt's 12-month price target is unlikely, given the elevated valuation, but it is possible over a five-year time period.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has three main growth engines: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. The first two opportunities are interconnected. Specifically, Amazon operates the most-visited online marketplace on the planet, and eMarketer says the platform accounted for 38.7% of retail e-commerce sales across North America and Western Europe last year.\n\nThat scale means Amazon is uniquely positioned to engage shoppers and source data from its marketplace, and the company has leveraged that advantage to build a booming advertising business. In fact, Amazon recently became the third-largest ad tech company in the world. And its recent decision to bring ads to Prime Video adds yet another opportunity.\n\nNot surprisingly, Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Devitt is particularly bullish on Amazon's ad tech business, and he recently wrote: \"The company is well positioned to continue taking share of global digital advertising spending over a multi-year period.\" But Devitt is also optimistic about the cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), where he believes growth will accelerate in 2024.\n\nWhether that happens or not, AWS is indeed primed for long-term growth as the AI boom unfolds. Consultancy Gartner has recognized its leadership in cloud AI developer services, and AWS recently extended its portfolio with the launch of Bedrock and Amazon Q. The former is a development platform for generative AI applications, and the latter is a generative AI business assistant. Both could help AWS tap the growing demand for generative AI software, a market Bloomberg believes will grow at 69% annually through 2032.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Retail e-commerce sales are projected to increase at 8% annually through 2030, while the ad tech and cloud computing markets are forecast to grow at 14% annually during the same period. Amazon will likely split the difference, meaning annual sales growth could range from 10% to 12% through the end of the decade. That estimate leaves room for upside should Amazon be especially successful in its AI ambitions.\n\nIn either case, its current valuation of 2.8 times sales looks quite reasonable, especially when the three-year average is 3 times sales. Patient investors should consider buying a small position today, but the key word is patient. The 41% upside baked into Wedbush's 12-month price target seems a bit too optimistic, but Amazon could certainly beat the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Spilt Stocks Crushing It in Artificial Intelligence That Could Soar in 2024",
        "content": "Data from Grand View Research shows that the artificial intelligence (AI) market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the decade's end. So it's not surprising that countless tech firms have restructured their businesses to prioritize AI, thus creating multiple ways to invest in the budding industry.\n\nDespite a surge in AI stocks last year, the market's immense potential indicates it's not too late for new investors to see major gains from the market. Meanwhile, companies that have recently split their shares are attractive options, as the move is often followed by significant growth.\n\nHere are two stock-split stocks crushing it in AI that could soar in 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded in recent years, with its shares soaring more than 1,300% since 2019. Stellar growth led management to trigger a 4-to-1 stock split in July 2021, its fifth split since 2000. And the company appears to just be getting started.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Nvidia emerged as one of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, achieving an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. The company's years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) allowed it to get a head start, while rivals like AMD and Intel have yet to catch up.\n\nIncreased demand for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) has seen Nvidia's earnings soar. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206%, with operating income up more than 1,600% thanks to a spike in chip sales in its data center segment. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nData by YCharts\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. That figure, multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45, implies a potential stock price of $1,080, projecting growth of 97% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a lucrative role in AI and tech in general. The company will need to contend with increased competition this year as other companies release new chips. However, its dominance will be challenging to overcome.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the market's growth potential suggests there's enough room for Nvidia to retain its lead and welcome newcomers. As a result, this stock-split stock is too good to pass up in the new year.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, it's impossible to deny Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) powerful role in tech. Its stock has risen 402% over the last decade, with its last split occurring in July 2022 in a 20-to-1 split.\n\nMuch of the company's success over the years stems from the billions of users its services attract. Alphabet has used its massive user base to build a lucrative digital advertising business, responsible for about 25% of the $740 billion digital ad market. Popular platforms like Google Search and YouTube present almost endless advertising opportunities for the company and have helped its earnings soar in recent years.\n\nSince 2019, Alphabet's annual revenue rose 75%, with operating income up 108%. Meanwhile, the company's free cash flow has climbed 200% in the last five years to $78 billion, indicating that Alphabet has the funds to invest heavily in its research and development and venture into burgeoning areas of tech -- such as AI.\n\nIn December, the tech giant unveiled its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini, which is expected to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4. The new model could open the door to countless growth opportunities in AI for Alphabet.\n\nGemini and the popularity of platforms like Google Search, Cloud, and YouTube could be a powerful combination. The company could have an advantage in AI with the ability to create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, add new AI tools on Google Cloud, offer more efficient advertising, and better track viewing trends on YouTube. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThese charts show Alphabet's stock is also significantly cheaper than that of its biggest competitors in AI, fellow cloud giants Microsoft and Amazon. The company has lower figures in two key valuation metrics: forward P/E and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratios. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/FCF divides its market cap by free cash flow. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nForward P/E and P/FCF are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In this case, Alphabet is a far bigger bargain than Microsoft or Amazon.\n\nAlongside a solid outlook in AI and consistent financial growth, Alphabet is a screaming buy in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "History Tells Us the Nasdaq Is About to Surge: 1 Stock to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Even after a big rally over the last year (it jumped 43% in 2023), the Nasdaq Composite index is still down roughly 7% from its record high. While past performance doesn't necessarily dictate future results, there's a historical connection between lower interest rates and stronger performance for growth stocks.\n\nSome analysts predict the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates this year. Rate cuts generally lead to lower yields on bonds, which makes borrowing money cheaper. Such conditions also tend to increase the appeal of stocks as an investment vehicle. In addition to the potential for positive valuation catalysts stemming from rate cuts, strong demand for companies involved with artificial intelligence (AI) could further power strong growth for the Nasdaq in 2024.\n\nWithin the AI space, no company has a stronger competitive position than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). If you're aiming to position your portfolio for the next Nasdaq bull market, read on to see why building a position in this AI leader stands out as a smart move. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has an unparalleled position in AI\n\nNvidia is the leading provider of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). While these hardware technologies were originally used for video games, they've become crucial for AI and cloud computing as well. The company currently controls roughly 90% of the market for high-performance GPUs, and it doesn't seem that its rivals, which include Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, will be able to match its technologies any time soon. As a result, Nvidia is expected to be one of the biggest winners in the still-nascent AI revolution.\n\nNvidia has already reported stellar business momentum. Here are some key performance points from Q3 of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ending Oct. 29, 2023):\n\nData center revenue surged 279% year over year to reach $14.51 billion. Overall revenue rose 206% year over year to hit $18.12 billion. Gross margin increased to 74%, up from 70.1% in Q2 2023 and 53.6% in Q3 of 2023. Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share soared 593% year over year to hit $4.02.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, Nvidia guided for the stellar growth to continue in fiscal 2024's Q4. The company's midpoint sales target calls for revenue of roughly $20 billion -- good for annual growth of roughly 231%. Meanwhile, the company expects continued margin expansion -- with its adjusted gross margin expected to tick up to 75%. It's also worth noting that Nvidia's guidance has proven to be very conservative over the last year.\n\nNvidia could still be greatly undervalued\n\nNvidia stock trades at roughly 45 times this year's expected earnings. On the face of it, that's a highly growth-dependent valuation. However, the company's current forward earnings multiple actually comes in far lower than might usually be expected given how fast the business is increasing its profits. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFor comparison, Microsoft posted earnings growth of 27% year over year in its last quarter and trades at a forward PE of 34. Meanwhile, Apple grew earnings by 13% year over year in its most recently reported quarter and has a forward PE of roughly 28.\n\nGiven that Nvidia has been posting such incredible growth, the company's current PE could indicate the stock is quite cheap. Why is the GPU leader trading at such a comparatively low earnings multiple given its growth? The core reason is that Nvidia's business has historically been prone to cyclical performance shifts.\n\nBut continued tailwinds from AI may be underestimated, and the company is making moves that could limit its exposure to future cyclical downturns. These initiatives revolve around building software and service components that generate dependable recurring revenue streams at consistently high margins.\n\nAs the leading provider of GPUs for high-performance-computing applications, Nvidia is perfectly positioned to build its own data center business. The company just started to expand its AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) business, and there's a good chance that this initiative will reduce cyclicality and open up new, high-margin sales streams.\n\nThe AI leader is on track to be a huge winner\n\nNvidia is still in the early stages of capitalizing on massive long-term trends connected to the AI revolution and trades at earnings multiples that look low in the context of its incredible momentum and opportunities.\n\nIf the Fed shifts to a policy of significantly cutting interest rates this year and beyond, it's reasonable to expect that investors could become willing to assign significantly more growth-dependent valuation multiples to stocks. While there's no guarantee that rate cuts and AI will push the Nasdaq to new highs this year, Nvidia stock is a great way to play AI trends.\n\nLong-term investors who build positions in top companies at the forefront of world-shaping trends position themselves to reap the rewards whenever the next bull market hits. Nvidia certainly fits the bill.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia. Here's a Better \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock for 2024.",
        "content": "Among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) had the best run in 2023, rising 239%. With that kind of one-year performance, investors shouldn't expect another repeat, or even for Nvidia to once again claim the crown of the best \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in 2024.\n\nInstead, I think investors should be looking at Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) to outperform its peers. Alphabet also had a strong 2023, up 58%. But it's valued much lower than Nvidia despite strong tailwinds. This all adds up to what should be a phenomenal year for Alphabet stock in 2024.\n\nAds are still Alphabet's primary business\n\nFirst and foremost, Alphabet's primary business is advertising. While most people are excited about its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities or cloud computing, the reality is that nearly 80% of revenue comes from its ad business.\n\nAlphabet has multiple ad streams, but its largest is its Google Search division. While this segment struggled throughout late 2022 and early 2023, the third quarter was different, as it grew revenue by 11% to $44 billion. Another key platform is YouTube, which holds the highest screen time among all streaming services. Revenue grew 12% in Q3, but expect this segment to have a big year as ad spending bounces back. Data source: Nielsen.\n\nWhile ads keep the lights on for Alphabet, other investments are starting to take shape.\n\nAlphabet's AI bets are starting to take form\n\nArtificial intelligence has been a key investment theme for Alphabet ever since CEO Sundar Pichai declared Alphabet an AI-first company. While this takes several forms (including optimizing the ad business to be more AI-powered), the latest iteration has been generative AI.\n\nThis movement took the world by storm when ChatGPT became popular in late 2022, and multiple companies began offering generative AI solutions for business. However, these models need to be built on a platform, and Alphabet's Gemini looks like a top option. Gemini beat the competition in several key benchmark tests, including becoming the first model to outperform human experts on the massive multitask language understanding test. Alphabet has yet to monetize this platform, but investors can expect that sometime in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso in Alphabet's AI aspirations is its cloud computing business, Google Cloud. Google Cloud currently sits in third place in terms of market share, but that position isn't a big deal considering how large this market is. Google Cloud has steadily grown above 20% year over year, yet hasn't optimized for profits. With an operating margin of just 3%, Google Cloud could be a massive profit boost when the company changes its mindset from growth at all costs to profitability. While that likely won't happen in 2024, it's a long-term booster for investors to consider.\n\nDespite these strong tailwinds, Alphabet still trades at a reasonable valuation.\n\nAlphabet's stock is attractively priced\n\nAlphabet's stock looks far more reasonable than Nvidia's 70 times trailing and 43 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nA valuation of 20 times forward earnings isn't a bad price, especially considering that Alphabet's stock hasn't traded that low in some time. Furthermore, with the right conditions, Alphabet could easily surpass these projections, making it an even better stock to own in 2024.\n\nWhile Nvidia is still a strong business, the stock has gotten ahead of itself. Investors are better off purchasing a stock like Alphabet right now, which provides growth at a reasonable price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Call them secret stocks or hidden gems. While the media tends to trumpet the same stocks repeatedly, plenty of stocks get almost zero notice. And, often they are crushing the broader market and helping to make their shareholders wealthy.\n\nInvestors need to explore these securities and add them to their portfolios if they hope to achieve long-term growth. This may require looking off the beaten path and tuning out the noise on TV and online message boards. Growth stocks are ripe for the picking, so let’s take a look at three such picks poised for massive growth.\n\nConstellation Software (CSU) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMaybe its because the company’s founder and president Mark Leonard is a enigma who keeps a low profile. Or maybe its because the company doesn’t hold earnings calls with analysts and shareholders. Whatever the reason, Toronto-based Constellation Software (TSE:CSU) appears set for massive growth in coming years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, Constellation Software is already a powerhouse growth stock. CSU stock has gained nearly 60% in the past 12 months and is currently trading at an all-time high. Over the last five years, the share price has risen 284%. And, the stock has grown a staggering 1,473% in the past decade. Constellation Software focuses on buying software companies that have strong management teams, consistent earnings, and a track record of growing profits.\n\nThe business model and stock performance has drawn comparisons to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), another holding company with a similar approach. CSU has been upgraded by numerous analysts, including RBC Capital Markets (NYSE:RY). It raised its price target on the CSU shares to $3,900 from $3,400 and maintained a buy equivalent rating. Constellation’s stock has never split. However, rumors are circulating that it could finally do so later this year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps it’s because it is a mid-cap stock that trades on the Russell 2000 index, but Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is definitely an overlooked security.\n\nConsider that SMCI stock has gained 327% in the last year and is up nearly 2,200% in the past five years. With these kinds of returns, you’d think analysts would be pounding the table on Super Micro Computer.\n\nThe red hot run in SMCI stock is due to an agreement with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to produce artificial intelligence (AI) servers for the chipmaker. In business since 1993, high-performance servers for the technology industry is Super Micro Computer’s bread and butter. And business is expected to boom in coming years as demand for AI servers grows significantly. Owing to the rising demand, SMCI’s recent earnings prints have toppled Wall Street forecasts.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt may not be the most overlooked growth stock on the market. After all, cloud-computing giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has gained 80% in the last 12 months and was the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2023.\n\nYet, CRM stock has not gotten the same amount of attention as other tech stocks, especially those that are part of the Magnificent Seven. However, expectations continue to run high for Salesforce and its stock.\n\nAnalysts at Baird investment firm just upgraded CRM stock to a buy from hold and lifted their price target on the shares to $300 from $240, implying 11% upside from current levels. Baird credited its upgrade to improving profit margins at Salesforce and the fact that the stock’s valuation is at historic lows. CRM stock jumped 10% higher after the company issued Q3 results in November that beat Wall Street forecasts. Additionally, the company is buying back $10 billion of its own stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 2 Magnificent Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Before It's Too Late",
        "content": "If you want to jump into the market in 2024, historical patterns are on your side. According to an analysis of the Nasdaq Composite going back to 1971, the tech-heavy index has risen an average of 19% every year following a recovery year like we experienced in 2023.\n\nFor investors, stock-split stocks can be a way to bet on the pattern continuing. Stock splits occur when a company divides each share into lower-priced units to make them more liquid and available to smaller investors. While these events don't impact company fundamentals, they are an encouraging sign that a stock is moving in the right direction.\n\nLet's discuss why two recently split stocks -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) -- could be great buys in the new year and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nAside from a massive crash in 2022, Nvidia's stock has risen almost exponentially over the last decade. To keep prices down to Earth, its management has conducted five stock splits -- most recently, a 4-for-1 conversion in July 2021. And while shares have risen dramatically since then, it's not too late for investors to bet on continued success.\n\nHistorically, Nvidia's growth has relied on its ability to take advantage of new technologies faster than rivals. This started with its graphics processing units (GPUs), which were initially designed to render video game visuals before finding another use in cryptocurrency mining. But generative artificial intelligence (AI) may be the big break that defines Nvidia's future for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the third quarter, AI chip sales helped send revenue up 206% year over year to $18.1 billion. With industry experts expecting the market for AI training hardware to expand from $45 billion to $400 billion by 2027, Nvidia has plenty of room for continued growth.\n\nTo be fair, competition will probably increase. But Nvidia's economic moat comes from its speed to market, which has given it a robust developer community that has built software and servers around its hardware and may be reluctant to switch to less-compatible rivals.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Monster Beverage\n\nLike Nvidia, Monster Beverage stock has risen dramatically over the past decade, leading to constant stock splits (six in total). The most recent conversion occurred in March of last year and gave investors two shares for each one they previously owned. And despite its $60 billion market cap, the energy drink maker still enjoys healthy business momentum.\n\nWhile net sales increased by a modest 14.3% year over year to $1.9 billion, the company enjoyed particularly impressive growth in its new alcohol business, which saw sales jump a whopping 58% to $42.3 million following the rollout of new products such as The Beast Unleashed line of malt alcohol drinks -- designed to appeal to its existing energy drink customers with similar flavors and branding. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMonster's burgeoning success in alcohol highlights its brand appeal and ability to use its existing supply chains and distribution networks to diversify its operations.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31, Monster stock is slightly more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 average of 28. However, the premium looks justified, considering its bottom-line momentum. Third-quarter net income rose 40% year over year to $452 million.\n\nFocus on the fundamentals\n\nWhile stock splits and historical patterns can make investors more confident in putting money into the stock market, fundamentals should be the biggest consideration. Nvidia and Monster Energy have performed well in the past. But more importantly, both companies have what it takes to continue rewarding investors over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and Top 11 Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and His Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nJim Cramer kicked off 2024 with an observation that the market might be undergoing a rotation where investors are taking profits from major mega-cap tech stocks and pouring these profits into the laggards of 2023 like banks, healthcare and consumer companies.\n\nWhat Jim Cramer's 'Crystal Ball' Says About 2024\n\nJim Cramer said that according to his \"crystal ball,\" investors this year would take profits selling \"best of the best\" and invest in companies that \"haven’t gotten respect for ages.\" By best of the best Cramer meant the Magnificent Seven group of stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  and \"richly valued\" software companies.\n\nCramer talked about his early days in the Wall Street where the beginning of every new year would bring excitement and enthusiasm among investors that caused \"repositioning\" in the market. Cramer said that most of the times this repositioning is temporary and does not have a lot of importance in the long run. Cramer said that some circles believe the Magnificent Seven group of stocks won't be able to sustain their rally. Cramer said he reluctantly agrees with this notion but long-term investors should approach these sell-offs as buying opportunities.\n\n\"A Heck With These Traders\"\n\nCramer predicted that 2024 markets would be defined by what the Fed does about inflation as traders will keep looking over their shoulder for the next inflation report and Jerome Powell's comments. But Cramer advised his viewers to \"don’t be one of those people,\" referring to investors who impulsively react to any \"utterances\" from the Fed, traders, economists or politicians about the stock market.\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer expressed his frustration with this short-term, reactive investing approach and said:\n\n\"Me? I say a heck with these traders.\"\n\nCramer Says AI and Software Bubbles Will be Popped\n\nJim Cramer said during beginning of every new year investors usually sell stocks that perform extremely well in the previous year and invest their money into beaten down stocks. But that trend changes after earnings season begins and investors come back to top performers of the previous year. Jim Cramer predicted that the artificial intelligence and enterprises software \"bubbles will be popped.\" But once these stocks come back to reasonable valuations compared to other stocks they will once again be bought, Cramer thinks.\n\nJim Cramer went through different sectors to weigh options for investors. For the healthcare sector, Cramer said \"no thank you\" since he believes healthcare stocks do not perform well during election years. For retail, Cramer said these companies are \"finally getting their arms around the shoplifting problem\" and could produce better returns. For the oil industry, Cramer said \"very difficult\" since \"we produce so much crude in this country\" that it's hard for oil prices to go higher.\n\nWait for the Sell-Off and Then Do \"Some Buying\"\n\nJim Cramer said he told his investing club members that they'll be \"rewarded\" if they bought stocks with decent valuations, not dramatically expensive when compared to average S&P 500 multiples. Cramer said investors should be patient and wait for the sell-off he's expecting and then do \"some buying.\" Jim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and Top 10 Stock Picks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC during early January and picked 11 stocks he's bullish on.\n\n11.

(NYSE:MODG), which manufactures golf equipment and accessories, as well as operates entertainment venues. Revenues were shy of expectations because recent wildfires in Canada led to temporary closures of Topgolf locations there. However, the company’s equipment sales showed larger-than-expected volumes and recent golf industry data indicated higher activity levels.”\n\n8. Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nAnswering a question about Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM), Jim Cramer recently said that Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) CEO Rene Haas is doing a \"fantastic job.\" Cramer said some circles have sounded skepticism around the stock amid weakness  in cell phone and PC business.\n\nCramer said that this company is doing \"so much so right, they are going to dominate cell phone, PC, hyperscale.\"\n\nCramer said he'd want to buy Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) for his charitable trust.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM).

(NASDAQ:GEHC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“That said, current macro factors of higher inflation, rising rates, and a slowing economy are affecting stock prices in the short-term. Against this backdrop, many consumer stocks and financing-based business models declined in the third quarter. For example, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) was our largest detractor for the period. A recent spinout from GE, the company is the world’s largest medical imaging supplier with steady growth and higher margins. We purchased the stock in the first quarter of 2023 when it was trading at 14 times normalized earnings, a significant discount to peers. Our research concluded that GEHC’s profit margins were temporarily depressed due to the spinoff and one-time Research & Development charges, and that management’s plan for improvement was credible. The stock got off to a strong start early in the year, but returned the bulk of its gains as higher borrowing rates for their customers created demand uncertainty. As well, 15% of GE Healthcare’s business is from China, where demand has slowed along with the economy. We view these headwinds as temporary, and added to our position during the stock’s recent pullback.”\n\n6. Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nJim Cramer was excited about aerospace-related engineering services company Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) recently.

        "title": "Better Semiconductor Stock: Nvidia vs. AMD",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have been in fine form on the market in the past year, which is evident from the 61% jump in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, and this terrific jump has helped two of the index's constituents -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nWhile shares of Nvidia are up a terrific 252% in the past year, AMD has gained 128% over the same period. It won't be surprising to see both these semiconductor stocks sustaining their red-hot run in 2024, especially considering that the semiconductor industry is expected to accelerate nicely this year.\n\nMarket research firm Gartner estimates that global semiconductor revenue could increase 17% in 2024 to $624 billion. That would be a huge improvement over last year's decline of 11%, which was caused by the weakness in the smartphone and personal computer (PC) markets, as well as tepid spending in the enterprise data center market.\n\nSo, which of these two chipmakers is in a better position to capitalize on the semiconductor industry's growth in 2024? And, more importantly, is Nvidia or AMD is a better bet right now from a valuation perspective following their red-hot run last year? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nWhile the semiconductor market was down last year, the demand for chips deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) servers for training large language models (LLMs) remained robust. Nvidia rode this gravy train and is on track to finish the ongoing fiscal 2024 with $59 billion in revenue, which will be more than double the $27 billion revenue it generated in the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe good news for Nvidia investors is that the demand for AI chips is set to keep growing rapidly in the coming years. According to investment bank UBS, the market for AI graphics cards and chips could grow at an annual rate of 60% through 2027, generating an annual revenue of $165 billion. Nvidia is predicted to maintain a dominant 85% share of this booming AI chip market in 2024, according to Raymond James, which should lead to impressive growth in the company's data center revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nRaymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri estimates that Nvidia's data center business could deliver $65 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025 (which begins next month). Nvidia has generated $29 billion in revenue from its data center business in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, which points toward an annual revenue of $39 billion based on the quarterly run rate.\n\nAccording to Raymond James' forecast, Nvidia's data center revenue could increase 66% in the new fiscal year. That won't be surprising, considering the solid demand for AI chips and Nvidia's share of this market. This, however, isn't the only side of the semiconductor market from which Nvidia stands to gain this year. The demand for the company's graphics cards that are deployed in gaming PCs (personal computers) should increase as well, thanks to a turnaround in this market and the adoption of AI-enabled computers.\n\nAll this indicates why Nvidia's total revenue is expected to jump a healthy 56% in fiscal 2025 to $92 billion. Even better, its earnings are expected to jump 66% in the upcoming fiscal year to $20.44 per share, giving growth-oriented investors a solid reason to keep buying this semiconductor stock.\n\nThe case for AMD\n\nUnlike Nvidia, which gets 80% of its total revenue from selling data center chips, the majority of AMD's revenue comes from selling central processing units (CPUs), graphics cards, and semi-custom chips used in PCs and gaming consoles. For example, in the third quarter of 2023, the company got 51% of its total revenue from selling chips into these markets.\n\nThis is why the recovery in the PC market is going to be a key catalyst for AMD in 2024. Canalys is forecasting an 8% increase in PC shipments this year, a nice turnaround following last year's drop of 12%. Moreover, AMD has positioned itself to capitalize on the market for AI-enabled PCs with its CPUs that are powering such computers. This should unlock a solid long-term growth opportunity for AMD as sales of AI-powered PCs are expected to post annual growth of 50% through 2030, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nHowever, AMD's gaming segment could continue to weigh on the company's performance. Its revenue from this segment was down 8% in the third quarter of 2023 due to tepid sales of its semi-custom chips, which are used by Microsoft and Sony in their popular gaming consoles. Given that the sales of gaming consoles are expected to increase by just 1.6% globally in 2024, AMD's gaming business may not get a big lift in 2024.\n\nAlso, Nvidia is the dominant player in gaming graphics cards with an 80% share, which means AMD isn't the best bet to capitalize on this market's growth. On the other hand, AMD's AI-focused business has yet to take off like that of Nvidia's. AMD is forecasting $2 billion in revenue from AI-related sales in 2024, which pales in comparison to Nvidia's revenue from this market.\n\nAll this tells us why AMD's growth is expected to be slower than Nvidia's. Analysts forecast its revenue to increase by 16.6% in 2024 to $26.4 billion, while earnings are forecast to increase by 41%. This relatively slower growth, however, isn't the only reason why Nvidia is looking like the better semiconductor stock of the two.\n\nThe verdict\n\nThe points cited above make it clear that Nvidia is set to clock faster growth. But what makes Nvidia an even better bet over AMD is the valuation. As the following chart indicates, Nvidia is significantly cheaper than AMD as far as the forward and trailing earnings multiples are concerned. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nAs such, investors looking to benefit from the semiconductor market's growth this year and capitalize on hot trends such as AI would likely be better off buying Nvidia over AMD.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Friday, January 12, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), The Boeing Co. (BA) and Sony Group Corp. (SONY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past six months (+19.3% vs. +16.9%). The company’s computer & networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+4% vs. -6.8%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.\r\n\r\nA strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term.\r\n\r\nHowever, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier joint venture might cause it to incur some loss in the future. Rising jet fuel price also poses a threat to the stock’s future growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Boeing here >>>)\r\n\r\nSony’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Audio Video Production industry over the past year (+13.7% vs. +12.7%). The company’s performance is benefiting from continued strength in the Games & Network (G&NS) segment. The company continues to expect to sell more than 25 million units of its PlayStation 5 in the current year.\r\n\r\nSONY sold 4.9 million units of PS5 in Q2, up 25% year over year. Strength in Music, and Pictures segments are other tailwinds. The Music segment benefits from higher recorded music and music publishing sales from paid subscription streaming services. Frequent product launches and strategic collaborations bode well.\r\n\r\nThe company also raised overall guidance for fiscal 2023 revenues It now expects sales of ¥12,400 billion compared with the earlier guidance of ¥12,200 billion. However, SONY lowered guidance for Pictures and Financial Services segments. Stiff competition and weak global macroeconomic conditions are concerning.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Sony here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), The Cigna Group (CI) and Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\n\nStory continues\n\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Yet, higher costs and subdued trading revenues are woes.\n\nCigna (CI) Benefits from Growing Membership, High Costs Hurt\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Cigna gains from improving membership and solid performances of Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare businesses. However, rising costs are a concern.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Banks on Strong Product Menu, Contract Wins\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Synopsys' focus on strengthening its product portfolio is helping it cater to the growing demand in the EDA market. Deal wins at leading semiconductor companies is a tailwind.\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Rides on Portfolio Strength, Solid Demand\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, the growing adoption of Workday's AI native human capital and financial management solutions in the retail and hospitality industry will likely boost the top-line growth.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions Aid Centene (CNC), High Costs Hurt\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, strategic buyouts are expanding Centene's markets and membership. However, elevated expenses remain a concern.\n\nMAP 2025 Plans Aid RPM International (RPM), High Costs Ail\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, RPM International is aiding from efficient execution of MAP 2025 initiatives and solid demand for infrastructure and reshoring projects. Yet, high costs are hurting prospects.\n\nUnited Therapeutics (UTHR) Dependence on PAH Drugs A Concern\r\nUnited Therapeutics is a leader in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and markets four drugs. However, the company's overdependence on PAH concerns the Zacks Analyst.\n\nNew Upgrades\n\nBooz Allen (BAH) Benefits From Differentiated Business Models\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Booz Allen Hamilton has developed its solutions business in a way that allows it to create differentiated business models and sales channels, and increase client acquisition.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions & Organic Growth Aids Fraklin (BEN)\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Franklin's strategic acquisitions, solid AUM balance and a strong distribution platform will likely support its top line. Decent liquidity aids sustainable capital distributions\n\nBusiness Growth via Acquisitions Continue to Aid DaVita (DVA)\r\nThe Zacks analyst is upbeat about DaVita's business strategy, which includes growth via acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses. A patient-centric care model also raises optimism.\n\nNew Downgrades\n\nHuge Debt Load, Rising Expenses Likely to Hurt BP's Margins\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, BP's debt-laden balance sheet can lead to volatile earnings, limiting its financial flexibility. The company's rising exploration expenses are also concerning.\n\nWeak Market Condition in Europe Ail Commercial Metals (CMC)\r\nPer the Zacks Analyst, Commercial Metals' results are impacted by the sluggish demand in Europe. Lower margins on steel products are other woes.\n\nMacro Woes, Dull North America Results Ail Envista (NVST)\r\nThe Zacks analyst is worried about Envista facing a weaker demand for its larger imaging equipments due to the ongoing macro issues. Disappointing North American implant business is also a concern.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "You’ll Wish You Had Bought Broadcom Stock at $1,000",
        "content": "Go ahead — pick a reason, or two or three, to buy Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock. Maybe you’re seeking portfolio exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. Or, perhaps you’re a passive-income investor or just want to balance growth and value. By taking a share position in Broadcom, you can get all of the above with just one technology stock.\n\nIndeed, Broadcom is a company that ought to be mentioned more often in the financial press. Granted, Broadcom isn’t part of the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” but it’s a magnificent idea to start a position in AVGO stock before $1,000 is just a distant memory.\n\nTarget Momentum and Yield With AVGO Stock\n\nWhile the press is busy talking about the massive gains in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock last year, they’re overlooking a semiconductor-devices stock that also provided stellar returns. Specifically, AVGO stock rode the AI hardware wave in 2023 from $600 to $1,000.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite this share-price growth, Broadcom isn’t extremely overvalued. Notably, Broadcom’s GAAP-measured trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 32.1x. That’s not too elevated when compared to Nvidia’s trailing P/E ratio of 62.66x and the valuations of some other “Magnificent Seven” companies.\n\nIt’s not only AVGO stock that’s growing. Broadcom’s financials are also growing, with the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 net revenue increasing 4% year over year.\n\nPlus, for all of fiscal year 2023, Broadcaom’s revenue grew 8% year over year to a company record of $35.8 billion. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan attributed this and other positive quarterly results to “investments in accelerators and network connectivity for AI by hyperscalers.”\n\nOn top of all that, Broadcom offers a forward annual dividend yield of 1.76%. That’s an added bonus — and by the way, some “Magnificent Seven” companies don’t offer any dividends at all.\n\nIs Broadcom Just the ‘Poor Man’s Nvidia’?\n\nLike I said earlier, Broadcom doesn’t receive a lot of coverage in the financial media. So, I was glad to see a strategist, Laffer Tengler Investments CEO Nancy Tengler, discussing Broadcom recently.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, I was shocked to hear Tengler call Broadcom the “poor man’s Nvidia.” Tengler also acknowledged that Broadcom is a “leader in AI.”\n\nStill, I must object to the idea that Broadcom is just a lesser version of Nvidia. Broadcom is a disruptor and innovator in its own right.\n\nFor instance, Broadcom is collaborating with Caltech, a world-renowned institute of technology and science. Together, Broadcom and Caltech will work to advance research in quantum science.\n\nIn addition, Broadcom supplies components for the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. So, it’s not really fair to characterize Broadcom as a “poor man’s” version of another company.\n\nBroadcom Stock: Buy It at $1,000 Now, or a Higher Price Later\n\nBroadcom stock will, sooner or later, trade at much more than $1,000. Remember, this is a world-class company that will ride the AI hardware wave higher, just like Nvidia has done.\n\nIt’s also a nice bonus that Broadcom pays a dividend and isn’t extremely overvalued. In the final analysis, investors should take a close look at AVGO stock and seriously consider a buy-and-hold position today.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

In Symington’s case, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was his first 100-bagger as an active investor. It took him 13 years to achieve this challenging target.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt’s safe to say that when Symington first invested in Nvidia in 2010, it wasn’t nearly as well known as it is today. If you Google the term “emerging stocks to watch 2010,” you might find Nvidia was on a list or two.\n\nFast forward to 2024. I’ve been tasked with creating a trio of stocks to buy before they become household names. Here are my three possibilities.\n\nRxSight (RXST) Image of a woman with a digital display over her eye.\n\nSource: Who is Danny / Shutterstock.com\n\nHere’s what RxSight’s (NASDAQ:RXST) 10-K says about its business:\n\n“We are a commercial-stage medical technology company dedicated to improving the vision of patients following cataract surgery,” pg. 1 of its 2022 10-K states.\n\n“Our proprietary RxSight® Light Adjustable Lens system (“RxSight system”) is the first and only commercially available premium cataract technology that enables doctors to customize and optimize visual acuity for patients after surgery.”\n\nMost people know someone who’s had cataract surgery in the past. I probably need more than two hands to count all my friends and family who’ve had the procedure done. According to RxSight, approximately 50% of people 60 or older develop some form of cataracts.\n\nTypically, the surgeon removes the eye’s cloudy natural lens, replacing it with a clear intraocular lens (IOL). With traditional premium IOLs, patients specify their vision needs before surgery. If the surgery doesn’t meet those needs, future procedures must meet them.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the company’s Light Adjustable Lens (LAL), the doctor implants the LAL, and then after getting the patient’s input about vision shortcomings, uses its Light Delivery Device (LDD) to make the corrections necessary to meet the patient’s desired vision outcome.\n\nCustomization has become a significant differentiator in all industries and sectors. There is no more critical sector for customization than healthcare.\n\nGlobally, the premium IOL market generated revenue of $2.1 billion in 2022. It’s expected to grow by 13% annually over the next four years. Not only is RxSight going after this market, but it’s also working to convert the 75% of cataract surgeries that don’t opt for premium IOL procedures.\n\nThis is a potentially lucrative secondary revenue stream, with 28 million cataract surgeries performed worldwide in 2022.\n\nI expect to hear more from RxSight in 2024.\n\nRemitly (RELY) An image of two cellphones with coins flying from one screen into the other. Fintech Growth Stocks\n\nSource: kentoh/Shutterstock\n\nRemitly (NASDAQ:RELY) is a Seattle-based company founded in 2011 that provides digital cross-border remittance for its 5.4 million customers. In the last 12 months, its customers have sent $36 billion in funds to loved ones in more than 170 countries worldwide.\n\nThe company disrupts the money transfer industry, taking market share from legacy providers Western Union (NYSE:WU) and Moneygram, now owned by Madison Dearborn Partners, a Chicago private equity firm.\n\nIn Q3 2023, Remitly’s active customers grew by 42% to 5.4 million from 3.8 million a year ago. The volume of money sent increased by 36% to $10.2 billion, resulting in $242 million in revenue, 43% higher than Q3 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, its adjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million, 384% higher than a year earlier.\n\nIn 2023, its revenues should grow at least 43% to $935 million, with adjusted EBITDA of at least $36 million, $3 million higher than its previous guidance.\n\nThe remittance market is estimated at $1 trillion annually, and it’s not going away. I could see Remitly continuing to take market share from the legacy providers for years.\n\nSouth African internet giant Naspers (OTCMKTS:NPSNY) owns 21% of its shares.\n\nGreen Brick Partners (GRBK) A photo of a man with a clipboard in front of a home under construction.\n\nSource: Shutterstock.com\n\nGreen Brick Partners (NYSE:GRBK) is a $2-billion homebuilder backed by hedge fund investor David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital owns 36% of its stock.\n\nA year ago, I recommended GRBK stock as one of seven stock picks to buy in December 2022. The company’s plan to capture market share while generating industry-leading gross margins would hold it in good stead heading into 2023. Since the article was published on Nov. 27, 2022, its shares are up 126%.\n\nI expect them to continue moving higher in the years ahead as its various home brands operating in Texas, Georgia, Florida, and Colorado become better known to homebuyers.\n\nIn Q3 2023, it had 788 net new home orders, 95% higher than a year earlier, with a $622.6 million backlog, 10.4% higher than at the end of Q3 2022. Although income was down slightly in the quarter due to a higher income tax rate, it’s poised for another good year in 2024.\n\nThis is a long-term buy. David Einhorn’s been happy with his investment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Nvidia Surged Even Higher This Week",
        "content": "It's been a bullish week for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. As of midday Friday, the index has leapt by almost 3% since last week's close. But the stock of tech giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has blown away those results. The advanced semiconductor chipmaker's shares have surged by 11.3%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThat follows a banner year in 2023 that saw the stock more than triple. But much of those gains came in the first half of 2023 after the markets realized just how much revenue was growing from Nvidia's leading artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nBut the move to start 2024 has the stock breaking out of a more than six-month trading range. This week's gains come after the company made a splash at both the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference and the CES (formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas.\n\nAI takes center stage\n\nMost investors know that Nvidia stock soared when revenue from AI applications exploded early last year. But with no real additional catalysts, the stock has traded in a relatively steady range for the last half of 2023. But it started to break out of that range in 2024, and has accelerated gains this week.\n\nThat was triggered as investors start to see additional uses for its AI chips. At the J.P. Morgan conference, Nvidia healthcare Vice President Kimberly Powell emphasized how computer aided drug discovery will accelerate progress similar to how computer aided design (CAD) did for chip design. She added that the company's BioNeMo AI platform for drug discovery has already been deployed by an Amgen subsidiary for its genomics foundation molecular models.\n\nThe next catalysts\n\nThat, along with new gaming, generative AI, and robotics innovations revealed at the CES has investors thinking the next wave of revenue-generating catalysts are imminent. Nvidia also said this week that it is planning to address new U.S. government regulations on advanced chips going to China by planning a new series of AI chips with more limited capabilities that will comply.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's one more headwind being addressed that could have impacted revenue growth. But all the news this week points to further jumps in sales, and investors are jumping into Nvidia stock before the company reveals more details in its next financial update on Feb. 21.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) Still Looks Cheap Near Highs. Here’s Why",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has managed to pull it off again, recently surging to hit new highs after many months of consolidating the explosive gains from last year. It may be hard to believe, but the stock’s valuation still doesn’t seem all that absurd. Undoubtedly, it took a few fantastic quarters for the semiconductor kingpin to grow into its lofty multiple. Given the pace of growth (which shows no signs of grinding to a slowdown) and its market leadership, I have to maintain a bullish stance.\n\nWith the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom still heating up (one could argue it’s still in the early innings), there’s a good chance Nvidia could prove the “value crowd” wrong as sales not only meet today’s high slate of expectations but exceed them.\n\nWall Street Still Sees Value in NVDA Stock\n\nIt’s not a mystery why Wall Street still views NVDA stock as a Buy. I think it’s hard to be anything but bullish if you recognize the massive demand potential for next-generation chips as nascent technologies like generative AI, the metaverse, and self-driving (and electric) vehicles come onto the scene.\n\nFurther, the company’s ability to stay in the lead as new entrants give it their all to take a bit of share leaves me incredibly encouraged and perhaps willing to pay up a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple north of 72 times for the $1.35 trillion chip juggernaut.\n\nFor 2024, the analyst community is continuing to pound the table, with few highlighting valuation as an issue, at least compared to many of its AI rivals who’ve suffered downgrades following last year’s hot tech surge.\n\nOppenheimer’s Rick Schafer has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock, with a $650.00 price target, which entails 18.6% in gains for the year ahead. Schafer isn’t just bullish on Nvidia stock for 2024; he views it as one of his “top 2024 picks” to bet on AI.\n\nWhat could help power the next leg of gains for Nvidia? Schafer views Nvidia’s B100 GPU — an AI chip that reportedly will double the performance of its H200 chip — as a potential catalyst once it’s released this year. Those are some serious performance gains that could help Nvidia gain even more ground over its chip peers. In many ways, Nvidia seems to be sprinting in the AI race as many of its competitors merely jog.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Nvidia Stock Deserves an Even Higher Multiple\n\nIt’s tough to make an argument that a stock going for more than 70 times trailing P/E is undervalued. Looking at the forward P/E multiple one year out (currently at 27.5 times, just 25% more than the semiconductor industry average of 21.8 times), though, it becomes more apparent that Nvidia is delivering on the earnings growth front, perhaps sooner than many skeptics may have anticipated.\n\nPerhaps Nvidia’s generational growth prospects warrant an even higher price tag and certainly a greater premium over the peer group.\n\nI’ll admit that I was one of the Nvidia skeptics who questioned the stock’s sky-high multiple and the firm’s abilities to meet what I thought were absurdly high expectations. I’ve since changed my tune, given Nvidia’s ability to deliver chips that outdo predecessors by leaps and bounds.\n\nFurther, the AI arms race could stand to heat up again as firms get serious about having the very best hardware to power their AI models. In 2024, the firms that possess B100 chips may have a competitive advantage over rivals with the H-series line of chips.\n\nMany big-name analysts on Wall Street make a compelling case for why it makes sense to view the seemingly expensive growth stock as a potential value play. As the great Warren Buffett once put it, “growth and value investing are joined at the hip.”\n\nGrowth and value investing are similar in that investors strive to get more (intrinsic value) for less. At this juncture, Nvidia stock may very well be a play that momentum and value investors can appreciate.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 36 analyst ratings, there are 32 Buys and four Hold recommendations. The average NVDA stock price target is $661.64, implying upside potential of 21.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $560 per share to a high of $1,100 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock\n\nA lead in the chip scene, I believe, ought to be worth a far larger premium to the industry, given how difficult it is for laggards to catch up to leaders in the world of chips.\n\nIndeed, by the time a competitor launches its latest and greatest offering that’s comparable to a past Nvidia chip, Nvidia has likely already moved on to its next product (for 2024, that’d be the B100 chip), one that’s likely more powerful, faster, and perhaps even more power efficient.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Time to Load Up on This New Magnificent 7 of ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks",
        "content": "Wall Street analysts tend to always look on the bright side of life. (Cue the Monty Python song). But even though bullish “buy” ratings for top stocks are far more common than tepid “hold” recommendations and the dreaded four-letter curse word of “sell,” there are some companies that analysts like more than others. How can you tell? In addition to looking at the rating, it’s important to see what the consensus price target is for the stock. After all, what use is it to an investor if someone has a “strong buy” on a stock but only thinks that it will go up slightly from current levels?\n\nWith that in mind, I looked on TipRanks and used the free screening tool at Finviz to find actively traded stocks where analysts had assigned both their top ratings AND had a price target that’s at least 20% above current levels. That way, you’re getting a stock that analysts truly believe will go a lot higher.\n\nUsing this methodology, I came up with a septet of stocks, a new Magnificent 7 if you will. One of the stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), actually is a member of the vaunted top seven stocks of the Nasdaq. It’s no secret why Wall Street continues to adore Nvidia (32 out of 36 analysts have it rated at least a “buy”). The graphics chip giant is benefiting from the boom in artificial intelligence and could gain further ground from the rebound in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices now that spot ETFs have finally been approved.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYes, Nvidia is an expensive stock, trading at an all-time high with a market cap of about $1.36 trillion and a multiple of nearly 45 times this year’s earnings forecasts. But Wall Street is predicting that profits and sales will more than double this fiscal year and surge more than 50% in 2025. And analysts expect the stock to climb another 20% to above $660 a share.\n\nIdentifying a New Magnificent 7 of Strong Buy Stocks\n\nSo, who are the other six among the “strong buy” crowd? Oil giant (and Dow component) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) made the cut. Analysts have a price target of just under $180 on Chevron, nearly 25% higher than its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nChevron also has a big fan in Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has a stake in Chevron worth more than $16 billion, making up nearly 4.5% of the Oracle of Omaha’s portfolio.\n\nInterestingly, despite worries about trade tension between the U.S. and China and concerns of a Chinese economic slowdown, analysts are exceedingly upbeat about two mega-cap Chinese tech stocks: e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and search leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), aka the “Google of China.” Analysts expect Baidu’s stock to surge 45% this year while the consensus target for Alibaba is nearly 70% above current prices.\n\nBoth stocks have fallen sharply since peaking in early 2021, but Wall Street is bullish on the AI prospects for both companies. Alibaba, remember, is also a cloud computing giant in addition to owning online retail sites Taobao and Tmall. And Baidu has developed the Ernie chatbot, a rival to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed ChatGPT from OpenAI. Baidu recently said that Ernie has more than 100 million users.\n\nGambling giant Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), another firm with significant exposure to the Chinese economy, is also a top analyst pick. The company, despite having Vegas in its name and a headquarters in Sin City, is no longer a big player on the famed Strip. Las Vegas Sands sold the Venetian in 2022 and now owns properties in Singapore and Macao. Shares have taken a hit in the past few months due to concerns about a big stock sale by top shareholder Miriam Adelson. The billionaire sold a chunk of LVS shares to raise cash to buy a majority of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team from fellow billionaire Mark Cuban of Shark Tank fame. But the pullback might be an overreaction. Analysts are forecasting that the stock will climb more than 25% this year, and a lucky 11 of the 13 that follow the company have it rated a “buy.” What’s more, analysts are forecasting a more-than-15% jump in revenue this year and 45% increase in earnings.\n\nDelta (NYSE:DAL), like LVS, is also benefiting from a global travel renaissance. The airline giant reported strong revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter Friday. CEO Ed Bastian said in the earnings release that “demand for air travel remains strong.” International travel is particularly booming; international revenue surged 25% in the quarter. Delta’s stock nonetheless slid Friday morning due to concerns about the outlook. The company trimmed its 2024 forecast, citing supply chain issues. But investors shouldn’t be too concerned. Earnings are still expected to be up sharply from 2023 levels. All 12 analysts that cover the company have Delta rated at least a “buy” and the price target is more than 30% above current levels.\n\nBiogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) is the final stock in this new Magnificent 7. The biotech is a leader in treatments for multiple sclerosis and Biogen could have another blockbuster on its hands with Leqembi, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration last year for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Regulators in China and Japan have also approved Leqembi. Biogen is also looking to expand in treatments for rare neurological diseases, thanks to its recent acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals for $7.3 billion. It’s no wonder then that Wall Street is a fan of the stock. Analysts are predicting a 25% pop in Biogen’s shares this year.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

        "title": "Qualcomm CEO: Leading tech requires 'big business in China'",
        "content": "Restrictive US policies limiting advanced chip exports to China have done little to dampen Qualcomm’s (QCOM) enthusiasm for the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nIn an interview at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, CEO Cristiano Amon expressed confidence about Qualcomm’s business in the country, its largest market by revenue.\n\n“If you have a leading technology, you're going to have a big business in China,” he said.\n\nThe San Diego-based firm finds itself in a difficult situation, as the White House and Congress ramp up a pressure campaign to curb the sale of US chips and chipmaking tools to China, citing national security concerns. The Biden administration has argued that China’s access to advanced semiconductors could aid military advancements.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, government agencies and state-owned firms have widened their ban on Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones for employees. Qualcomm is one of Apple’s biggest suppliers. Customers experience the iPhone 15, powered by Qualcomm chips, at the Apple flagship store in Shanghai, China, on Nov. 12, 2023. (Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nChina remains the largest semiconductor market in the world, with sales in the country accounting for one-third of the global market, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). With combined annual sales of $50 billion for Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm, the country remains a major revenue driver for American chipmakers.\n\nAdditional curbs are likely to pose the biggest threat to Qualcomm, which has the largest exposure to the market, with the country accounting for roughly 60% of overall revenue. The firm supplies chips to major Chinese handset makers, including Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Huawei.\n\n“So far, many of the policies have not yet restricted the ability to continue to do business in phones, in PCs, and cars, and we want that to continue,” Amon said. “While we cannot predict the future, I think stronger relationships between Chinese enterprises [and] American enterprises always serve as a stabilizing factor in the [bilateral] relationship.” Cristiano Amon, CEO of Qualcomm, emphasized the role of the Chinese market at CES 2024, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas on Jan. 10, 2024. (Steve Marcus/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe Chinese market has helped drive the recovery for Qualcomm, as it looks to bounce back from years of sluggish smartphone sales. Amon said the firm saw an estimated 35% jump in sales to Chinese smartphone makers during the company's fourth quarter earnings call.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe added that the company remains focused on diversifying its offerings in China, instead of diversifying away from the region. Under his tenure, Qualcomm has made an aggressive push into the automotive space, with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform, designed for vehicles that are increasingly defined by software.\n\nMajor Chinese automakers, including BYD, Nio, and Li Auto, have integrated Qualcomm chips into their vehicles.\n\n“We want to create growth vectors for the company,” he said. “Mobile is a great market. Every time you have an upgrade, you're going to have growth, but it's a fully penetrated market.”\n\nRead more coverage from CES 2024:\n\nQualcomm CEO: Generative AI in smartphones could 'create a new upgrade cycle' Nvidia debuts RTX 40 Super chips to power gaming and AI efforts at CES 2024 AMD debuts AI-focused Ryzen 8000G desktop chips at CES 2024 Microsoft is adding an AI button to PC keyboards, their first major change in 30 years From AI to flying cars, here’s what to expect at CES 2024\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "10 Best AI Stocks for 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the10 Best AI Stocks for 2024. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article 5 Best AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nThe latest inflation report has yet again made investors uneasy about the Fed's possible path forward. The persistent shadow of inflation is perhaps here to stay for some time and investors will adapt to this new environment. Stifel said in its 2024 outlook report themed \"Embracing Change\" that higher rates are \"here to stay\" as the firm expects muted but positive returns for stocks this year. However, Stifel said that inflation is clearly showing signs of deceleration and risks are now \"balanced.\"\n\nStifel recommended long-term investors to maintain their \"composure\" in 2024 and embrace the fact that change is the only constant in life. While sooner or later inflation will recede and rates will come down, what is here to stay and change the course of human progress is AI, which, according to Stifel, \"stands on the cusp of reshaping industries and the economy.\"\n\nThe AI revolution is that once-in-a-century kind of phenomenon that will shape and impact our society at every level. PwC said in a report said that its 2023 Emerging Technology Survey showed that just one year after the launch of ChatGPT, 54% of the surveyed companies had already implemented generative AI in some areas of their business. Companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are already launching AI products and services affecting billions of users around the globe. Best AI Stocks for 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this context, we decided to take look at some of the top AI stocks that hedge funds are piling into. For this article we first listed all popular companies that are set to gain and profit from the latest AI trends. These companies are receiving bullish comments, ratings upgrades and price target hikes from analysts because of their products and services related to AI. From this long list of stocks we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. The idea was to see which AI-related stocks are the favorites of smart money investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the most notable stocks that is gaining attention on the back of AI-related catalysts. Dan Ives of Wedbush in December listed the stock among his favorite AI and tech plays of 2024.\n\n\"While IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, we believe cloud and AI driven spending will be up 20%-25% over the next year with use cases now exploding across the enterprise and consumer landscape,” Ives said in his note.\n\nCharlotte AI is one of the generative AI products offered by Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) that have been making waves. Charlotte AI is a chatbot which can be probed by end users and security analysts regarding their system’s deficiencies and best security practices.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike gained amid resilient cybersecurity spend, continued revenue growth against well-managed expenses, and traction in endpoint adjacencies.\n\nWe have underscored that the purpose of our risk management framework is to enhance value creation and aid in the execution and implementation of our investment program. However, this stage of risk management best manifests itself in down markets as it did in 2022. This year has been quite different since equities have broadly recovered, and our risk management focus has shifted toward establishing a level of permanence. We characterize this phase of risk management as Value Capture. Essentially, we have harvested disproportionate equity outcomes (Nvidia)and other strong performers (Passport holdings such as CrowdStrike) to fund a ~700bps increase in our India weighting (Makemytrip, Apollo Healthcare), a 235bps investment in Coca Cola (in correlation terms the real thing), and even a 114bps position in Alibaba (6.6X consensus 2023 EPS at purchase). These investments are not risk free, but they are stores of value that have the potential to enhance diversification and staying power in any market reversal. Moreover, we have marginally reduced portfolio concentration over the course of the year. Essentially, 2022 was a moment of extremely low reinvestment risk that allowed us to deemphasize China and other holdings, while concentrating around a handful of financially and strategically sound investments such as Nvidia, MercadoLibre, Airbnb and CrowdStrike.With these investments having largely reflated, we have sought to redistribute some of this capital while retaining significant residual positions. It is our hope that these actions can enhance our ability to execute our investment program if, for example, market exuberance about monetary policy proves excessive.”\n\n9. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 112\n\nAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the companies best positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) has integrated AI features in its product suite that allows end users to simply give text-based commands to design graphics and edit photos. These features are expected to increase Adobe Inc's (NASDAQ:ADBE) product demand.\n\nJim Cramer said in a program a few months back that Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) made the “best use of AI.”\n\nA total of 112 hedge funds out of the 109 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) as of the end of the third quarter. The most significant stakeholder of Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) was Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $2.3 billion stake in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nIn addition to Adobe, hedge funds are also piling into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 110\n\nMany analysts are betting that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will be one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the AI boom. After all, Nvidia won’t be the only company making chips for generative AI systems. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has a history of catching up to its competition and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is already out with its new AI-focused chips.\n\nIn December, UBS called Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) one of its top semiconductor picks. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in his note that the semiconductor industry was entering a “sweet spot” and 2024 will see inventory converting to revenue.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 110 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”\n\n7. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 122\n\nEarlier this month, Bank of America added Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) in its top software stock picks for 2024.\n\n\"We expect mid-teen revenue growth, improving margins, multiple reversion and positive revisions to offset cyclical headwinds in [first-half of 2024] before driving a stronger [second half of 2024],” BofA’s Alkesh Shah said.\n\nAbout Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Shah said he sees \"enduring\" revenue growth in the mid-teens and increasing margins.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”\n\n6. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 221\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of frontrunners in the AI race since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) has the vantage point that allows it to integrate AI technologies into various services and products. Recently, BMO Capital Markets Brian Pitz said in a note that the blend of AI and content creation would help Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) along with several other tech companies. He started covering the stock with an Outperform rating.\n\nA total of 221 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds had stakes in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The biggest stakeholder of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) during this period was Ken Fisher’ s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $5.7 billion stake in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included long positions in KKR, Ciena Corporation and Alphabet. Shares of media and technology company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) rose in the quarter as its advertising and cloud businesses remain robust and the company delivered results ahead of market expectations. From a sector perspective, communication services also managed a positive Q3 (2%), riding the ongoing wave of positive mega-cap stocks’ performance, like Alphabet.”\n\nLike Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet is also a hedge fund favorite when it comes to AI investing.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Hedge Funds 10 AI Stocks Billionaires Are Crazy About Jim Cramer’s 10 Best AI Stocks\n\nDisclosure.None. 10 Best AI Stocks for 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the16Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors are hopeful that small- and mid-cap stocks will experience a broader rally this year after getting hammered for most part of the previous year as all eyes remain focused on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks amid the AI boom. Noah Blackstein, senior portfolio manager at Dynamic Fund, said in a program on CNBC that market returns were “broadening out” to small- and mid-cap stocks and these stocks are expected to catch up in 2024.\n\nDespite their lackluster performance in 2023, mid-cap stocks managed to end the year at a positive note when compared to large- and small-cap stocks. The S&P MidCap 400 was up 14.5% to 2781.54 in 2023. This was just 5% below the index’s record high level. Compared to mid-cap stocks, the S&P 500 large-cap index was up 24.2% while the Russell 2000 small-cap index was up 15.1% in the period.\n\nAccording to a latest Wall Street Journal report, Karim Ahamed, an investment adviser for Cerity Partners in Chicago, said that mid-cap stocks provide a decent blend of growth potential (of small-cap stocks) and financial stability (of large-cap stocks).\n\nAs investors prepare to look beyond mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2024 and invest in other, relatively unknown companies with growth potential, we decided to see which mid-cap stocks with high revenue growth are popular among smart money investors. Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify mid-cap stocks with revenue growth rates of over 30% over the past five years as well as in the most recent quarters. From these stocks we chose 16 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nStory continues\n\n16. Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nBenefits management company Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY) is one of the best mid-cap growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In November, Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY) posted third quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $0.16, beating estimates by $0.05. Revenue jumped about 36.8% year over year to $280.9 million, beating estimates by $9.55 million.\n\nPolen Global SMID Company Growth Strategy made the following comment about Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We bought a new position in Progyny, Inc. (NASDAQ:PGNY), a company owned in our U.S. strategies for some time. They are a leading provider of fertility benefit solutions, and through their differentiated approach, their clients can pursue the most effective treatment and achieve optimal outcomes. We believe the company has only a mid-single digit share of its potential total addressable market and is the most dominant player within the fast-growing managed care category. They are already profitable, earn high returns on incremental capital, and have plenty of runway to grow top-line growth as they continue to win new clients and add new services.”\n\n15. Shoals Technologies Group Inc (NASDAQ:SHLS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nGoldman Sachs recently released a list of 2023 laggards it believes could gain in 2024.

(NASDAQ:SHLS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Solar energy technology companies SolarEdge and Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS), meanwhile, saw headwinds from destocking in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. demand could slow further due to new net metering rules that reduce the value to consumers from sending excess residential solar energy back to the grid. SolarEdge, which makes inverters for solar systems as well as residential and commercial battery systems, is also facing rising battery competition in the U.S. from Tesla.”\n\n14. Confluent Inc (NASDAQ:CFLT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nData streaming platform company Confluent Inc (NASDAQ:CFLT) is one of the best mid-cap growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Shockwave Medical Inc (NASDAQ:SWAV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nMedical device company Shockwave Medical Inc (NASDAQ:SWAV) ranks 13th in our list of the best mid-cap growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:SWAV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also added a new position in Shockwave Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWAV), in the health care sector. The company’s innovative products help clear blockages inside arteries at a lower risk and higher efficiency than other, traditional solutions leading to more optimal outcomes for patients with coronary, vascular and heart valve diseases. We believe these innovations leave Shockwave poised for higher growth, improved margins and attractive free cash flow in a large, total addressable market.”\n\n12. Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nProject management software company Monday.Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY) shares rose in November after strong Q3 results and a bullish Q4 outlook.

However, some investors appeared concerned that as Caplyta volumes increased to a higher level that the rate of growth will slow.

However, over time we believe the company’s profit cycle will become more stable than its end market given an ongoing digitalization trend within the construction industry, a diverse client base, large backlogs, high customer retention and the ability to cross-sell products that improve efficiency and margins. Furthermore, the company has access to a lot of data and is exploring AI as a way to help customers become more efficient, potentially enhancing its value proposition and pricing power.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Mid-Cap Growth Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Undervalued Mid Cap Stocks To Buy According to Analysts 15 Undervalued Defensive Stocks For 2024 12 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 12, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Photronics, Inc. PLAB, ASML Holding N.V. ASML and Micron Technology, Inc. MU.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Solid Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for a Promising 2024\n\nThe semiconductor market is staging a solid rebound after a not-so-impressive first half of 2023. Semiconductor sales rose a solid 5.3% year over year in November 2023, the first time since August 2022, as demand rebounded on easing inflation, the Semiconductor Industry Association said on Jan 9.\n\nSales totaled $48 billion in November compared to $45.6 billion a year ago. Also, sales jumped a solid 2.9% month over month in November from October's total of $46.6 billion.\n\nThe year-over-year jump in sales in November was driven primarily by robust demand from China, where sales were up 7.6%. Besides, sales rose 7.1% in Asia Pacific and 5.6% in Europe, while it witnessed a 3.5% rise in the Americas.\n\nThe semiconductor market, which reached unprecedented heights during the peak of the pandemic, suffered from a supply-chain crisis in 2021, which saw sales slowing at a fast pace. Although demand was high in 2022 and the supply-chain crisis eased, rising prices and inflationary pressures started taking a toll on sales.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's monetary tightening campaign that saw rates being hiked by 525 basis points further slowed sales.\n\nHowever, semiconductor demand was always high from multiple industries, which saw the industry making a steady rebound from the second quarter of 2023 and sales have since been on the rise.\n\nDemand for semiconductors is expected to rise through 2024, which bodes well for the industry. The semiconductor market is expected to experience positive outcomes due to the global integration and extensive utilization of consumer electronics.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the growing influence and broad implementation of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and machine learning are foreseen to be significant factors in sustaining the ongoing demand for semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), global semiconductor sales are projected to jump 13.1% in 2024. WSTS estimates global sales to reach $588.4 billion.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks.

        "title": "Stocks Are Preparing For The Earnings Season",
        "content": "The beginning of 2024 has brought some cooling to the bond markets, with yields of 30-year treasury bonds bouncing to around 4.2%, after which expectations of the market stabilized. According to the Fed funds futures, the consensus forecast for the interest rate in July 2024 is set for either a two or three-step decline in the interest rate.\n\nEmployment data in December was stronger than expected: 216k against 170k forecasted, which potentially might lead to an uptick in inflation, too. The market, however, seems to ignore the strong data, as a hawkish scenario doesn’t look realistic anymore. Thus, bulls might take control of the situation, given that the earnings season is approaching.\n\nHowever, now momentum is trimmed across all major markets, as investors wait for more information. Tech stocks and crypto assets are already discounting the upcoming bullish market, while metals and other commodities consolidate.\n\nIn this review, we will focus on two potential interesting ideas for upcoming weeks from equity markets. It would be stocks of Nvidia and JP Morgan Chase and Co.\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVDA had emerged from a large trading range, boosting the momentum ahead of the earnings season. With earnings to be published in February, NVDA might enter the “pre-earnings” rally. The estimated earnings-per-share of 4.15 drives momentum trading. AI narrative has been the strongest driving force behind tech stocks so far, and this trend has a chance to continue in 2024.\n\nTechnically, the price may retest the $500-505 price area before taking off to $620 and higher.\n\nJP Morgan Chase\n\nJP Morgan Chase and Co. is the leading investment bank in the United States and sets the tone for the financial sector. Earnings for JPM will be released on Friday, January 12. The company was consistently outperforming its guidance in 2023, so it has a clear bullish directional bias from the market.\n\nHowever, to sustain an intermediate-term trend, it might pull back to the dynamic support area of 157-167 first, as shown at the chart below. The price area of 190-200 may serve as a target area. However, it’s extremely difficult to correctly predict targets in the bull markets, as price may easily advance further than expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:\n\nAUD/USD Forecast – Australian Dollar Continues to Consolidate USD/JPY Weekly Forecast – US Dollar Gives up Some Gains After Initial Surge Super Micro Computer Is a Superstar Stock, the One Chart to Follow One Chart Reveals How You Can Find Superstar Stocks Like NVIDIA (NVDA) AUD/USD Forecast – Australian Dollar Testing Support USD/JPY Forecast – The US Dollar Falls After PPI Number",

        "content": "China's imports of integrated circuits (IC) plunged by both volume and value in 2023, although semiconductors remained the mainland's largest import item ahead of crude oil, according to customs data released on Friday.\n\nIn 2023, China imported a total of 479.5 billion IC units worth US$349.4 billion, down 10.8 per cent by volume and 15.4 per cent in value from 2022, official data showed. By comparison, the country spent US$337.5 billion importing crude oil last year, a fall of 7.7 per cent.\n\nThe weaker imports of ICs and semiconductor devices reflect economic headwinds in the world's second-largest economy last year, in particular China's weak smartphone and laptop sales. Meanwhile, the data was also affected by China's efforts to boost local output to cut reliance on imported chips.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

However, the country is making solid progress in boosting local output of legacy chips, including those being used in cars and home appliances, to satisfy domestic demand.\n\nAccording to the customs data, China's imports of diodes and similar semiconductor devices, a proxy of garden-variety commodity chips, were also down by 23.8 per cent in volume terms last year.\n\nThe US intensified its export controls on China in October 2022, which caused widespread disruption for global fabless and semiconductor tools companies in their China-related businesses. In October last year, the US further tightened the noose, cutting China's access to workaround chips that Nvidia had tailor-made for mainland customers.\n\nIn a state-backed drive to build a more resilient domestic chip supply chain, China's semiconductor players have upped their localisation efforts with closer cooperation between the biggest companies. These efforts may also have contributed to the decline of imported chips as China added mature capacity to enable production of the vast majority of chips locally.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina currently has 44 semiconductor wafer fabs in operation and a further 22 under construction, Taiwan-based IC research company TrendForce said in a recent note. By the end of 2024, the capacity for mature chip production - defined as 28-nanometre and older technologies - will be expanded at 32 Chinese fabs.\n\nThe massive expansion, which has caused alarm in the US and EU, will see China's global share of mature process capacity reach 39 per cent by 2027, up from 31 per cent in 2023, with room for further growth if equipment procurement proceeds smoothly, the TrendForce note said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is known for powering AI capabilities for companies around the world via its high-powered graphics processors. But at CES 2024, the company is highlighting how it’s using those same capabilities to power its automotive ambitions.\n\nPart of that includes Nvidia building out self-driving and advanced driver safety, as well as using generative AI to better understand vehicles or interpret what’s happening around a car.\n\n“There's a massive amount of data that's being generated from all the cameras on the car, the radar, lidar [light detection and ranging] on this vehicle, and that has to be processed in real time,” Nvidia VP of automotive Danny Shapiro told Yahoo Finance, while seated in the front of Mercedes’s CLA concept car at CES 2024.\n\n“That's when Nvidia comes in, providing the horsepower to take all that data, make sense of it, and understand exactly where the lanes are, where the potential hazards are, be able to read signs, check the lights, and so we're bringing that out now to make these vehicles safer to be an assistance feature for them,” Shapiro added.\n\nAnd with software-updateable vehicles, Nvidia says automakers will be able to add additional assistance features over time, with the hope that future vehicles will eventually get to full autonomy. A sampling of some of the upcoming vehicles in which Nvidia's technology can be found. (Nvidia) (Nvidia)\n\nBut it’ll still take some time before we’re able to lie back in the driver seat, watching a movie or taking a nap while our cars ferry us to and fro. According to Shapiro, the industry initially underestimated the complexity of what it would take to get self-driving cars on the road.\n\nThat’s another place Nvidia says its technology comes into play. By building out digital twins, one-for-one digital recreations of vehicles and cities in its Omniverse platform, Nvidia says it can teach self-driving AI how to handle various weather and driving situations.\n\nThe thinking is that by training an AI in a digital world and throwing anything they can imagine at it, Nvidia will be able to speed up the development of self-driving vehicles without having to risk potential accidents in the real world.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI, the standout technology of 2023, is also a part of Nvidia’s auto efforts. According to Shapiro, gen AI will help provide drivers with a complete rundown of a vehicle and why it’s taking certain actions.\n\n“Mercedes can train this large language model with the history of Mercedes vehicles, with all the information about the CLA concept, the manual, the service bank, whatever it is, so that when you have a dialogue with that vehicle, it comes back with the right answer,” he said. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n“Imagine we have an automated vehicle, the front-facing cameras taking in 30 frames a second of video. We can then use a large language model to convert the pixels in that video into an explanation of what's happening in the scene,” explained Shapiro.\n\nNvidia’s automotive business is still a relatively small part of the company’s total revenue. During Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter, the segment brought in $261 million. That’s compared to the $2.86 billion the company’s gaming division generated and the $14.51 billion its data center business brought in.\n\nThe company currently offers a variety of car tech including infotainment capabilities, but the eventual hope is that the business expands further as the self-driving technologies mature over time. For now, though, Nvidia’s advanced driver assistance functionality continues to improve.\n\nNow if I can just figure out a way to get that kind of stuff into my old Mustang.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy for a Future Fueled by AI",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) trade is alive and kicking. Companies tied to AI are rallying to start 2024 after a brief pullback. The continued upsurge in AI stocks comes as companies make announcements about increased production, new consumer products, and enhanced capabilities related to generative AI.\n\nThe focus among analysts and investors this year centers on the monetization of AI products and the boosts it can provide to companies’ bottom lines. The global market for AI is forecast in excess of $305 billion this year. And, by 2030, it could more than double to nearly $740 billion, according to market research firm Statista.\n\nWith a lot of money at stake, some companies will fare better than others in the race for leadership in the AI space. Let’s explore three stocks to buy for a future fueled by AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) remains the world’s largest microchip manufacturer. Also, it’s Asia’s most valuable publicly traded company with a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion. TSMC just reported an 8.4% year-over-year (YOY) decline in its revenue for December. That was released as part of the company’s preliminary Q4 earnings report. It is scheduled to report full Q4 earnings on Jan. 18.\n\nWhile the December sales dip isn’t great news, TSMC said that it is seeing demand recover as it manufactures more AI microchips, notably for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Also, the December figures suggest that TSMC beat Wall Street forecasts in Q4, with quarterly sales of 625.5 billion Taiwanese dollars ($20.1 billion U.S. dollars). The company has struggled to meet demand for AI chips in recent months but plans to double manufacturing capacity this year.\n\nTSM stock has gained 24% in the last 12 months yet has trailed other semiconductor stocks, such as Nvidia, whose share prices doubled and even tripled during 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts at Citigroup (NYSE:C) just named Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) one of their top semiconductor equipment stocks for 2024. Citigroup believes AMAT should continue benefitting from strong AI demand.\n\nThe bullish report is welcome news as AMAT stock slides 7% lower to begin 2024. Applied Material’s share price has softened ever since the company acknowledged late last year the investigation by the U.S. Justice Department over sales made to China.\n\nHowever, most analysts don’t see the Justice Department probe as being a long-term headwind for Applied Materials, which continues to report stellar financial results. The company’s latest print (Q3 2023) showed earnings per share (EPS) of $2.12, topping Wall Street consensus estimates of $1.99. Revenue totaled $6.70 billion, which was also above analysts’ expectations of $6.50 billion. AMAT stock is up 38% over the last 12 months and up 330% over five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG / GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains a leader when it comes to making AI products for consumers and businesses. Just before Christmas, the company introduced “Gemini,” its largest and most sophisticated AI model yet.\n\nThe company has made it clear that monetizing AI is its priority. To be sure, Gemini pushes AI technology forward quite a bit. It is reportedly the first AI model to outperform humans on subjects such as math and physics. Also, it can understand nuance and reason.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to integrate Gemini into its Bard chatbot to help advance its reasoning and planning capabilities. Expect the company to begin charging users for the Gemini suite of AI product later this year. Beyond Gemini, Alphabet is integrating generative AI into Gmail and Google Docs, as well as its Pixel phones and smart home devices. GOOGL stock has gained 60% over the last 12 months, including a 2% increase so far in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AMAT, NVDA and GOOGL.

        "title": "Nvidia partners with Mercedes to pursue self-driving cars",
        "content": "AI is the talk of CES 2024 (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas as the top developers and manufacturers unveil what their large-language models can achieve, especially on the road. Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley sits down with Nvidia Vice President of Automotive Danny Shapiro to discuss the chipmaker's autonomous driving projects.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to hone self-driving capabilities. Starting with an assisted driving feature, Shapiro believes the technology through this partnership will “add greater and greater levels of autonomy” until full self-driving is achieved.\n\n“Safety has got be the top priority” Shapiro insists, and suggests that a timeline for self-driving cars is hard to gauge.\n\nGoing beyond in-car technology, Shapiro states that the company’s generative AI is “leveraging the exact same data that is used to build the car,” by offering an automotive configurator that allows consumers to get the actual experience of the car before buying.\n\nClick here to view more of Yahoo Finance's CES 2024 coverage this week, or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nDAN HOWLEY: CES 2024 is in full swing. And right now, we're speaking with NVIDIA VP of Automobiles Danny Shapiro. Danny, thank you so much for joining us. I guess, you know, obviously, the big theme at CES 2024 is AI. So how does that fit into NVIDIA's automotive strategy?\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: That's a great question. We're super excited to be here in the Mercedes-Benz booth. And what we're showing behind me actually is the new CLA concept, which is going to be the first vehicle from Mercedes-Benz with NVIDIA DRIVE inside.\n\nSo that's our AI platform for automated driving, driver assistance, all kinds of convenience features. So we basically bringing the type of AI from the cloud that we're used to seeing but bringing it right into the car, processing the sensor data, and making the vehicle much safer to be in.\n\nStory continues\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think that's one of the interesting things to point out, right, is we all talk about generative AI in general. But self-driving cars-- or self-driving technology only exists because of AI.\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: That's absolutely right. There's a massive amount of data that's being generated from all the cameras on the car, the radar, now LiDAR on this vehicle. And that has to be processed in real time. So that's where NVIDIA comes in, providing those horsepower to take all that data and make sense of it and understand exactly where the lanes are, where the potential hazards are to be able to read signs, detect the lights.\n\nAnd so we're bringing that out now to make these vehicles safer, to be an assistance feature for them. But they're software updatable vehicles. So over time, we're developing the software with Mercedes and all of our auto customers to be able to then add greater and greater levels of autonomy. And eventually, we'll get to self-driving.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I guess when it comes to self-driving, is there a thought on when that might come? I know it's always the, you know, I guess, billion dollar question that everybody's kind of banding about. And the early prognosticators had said, oh, it'll be here in no time. But, obviously, it's a little bit longer than that probably.\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: Absolutely. You know, so this is a challenge we've been working on for well over a decade. It's something I think the entire industry underestimated the complexity. And the reality is safety has to be the top priority. It is for us. It is for so many of our partners. And we need to make sure we get it right.\n\nSo while these estimates were put out there initially, we realized we underestimated the complexity. And so we're focused on making sure that before we put anything out on the road, that it's tested and validated for every possible scenario.\n\nSo this is where another aspect of NVIDIA comes in. We can use simulation technology for the creation of the AI but also for testing and validating that AI and making sure that in all types of lighting conditions, all kinds of weather conditions, many different scenarios, the kinds of things that don't happen very often, it's hard to train for. So we can use AI and create synthetic data to understand what possibly could happen and make sure the car will react appropriately.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Is that something similar to the Omniverse, the digital twin kind of idea that NVIDIA has been working on where, yeah, you can build these digital--\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: Absolutely.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: --versions of objects, factories, things like that?\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: You're absolutely right. So we really are able to apply this across the entire workflow within the auto industry from the designers that can use Omniverse and create essentially digital versions of the vehicle, right? That's part of the design process. But then using Omniverse, that exact same model becomes part of what goes into the engineering team, then can go into the manufacturing side where we can create a virtual factory, a digital twin of the factory.\n\nIt's modeling every aspect of the factory-- the robots, the conveyors, the other employees working inside the factory. We can model all that, optimize it, and make sure it all works before the factory is even built. And then we can even extend that model beyond into the retail side using all that same data to create a virtual retail or showroom experience. People can customize their car; choose different materials, the interior trims, different wheels; and even take it on a virtual test drive.\n\nSo all of that simulation then is a very valuable tool throughout that whole workflow. So in addition to testing and validating the AVs, it really applies to all the mechanical, physical, and even sort of retail and service extensions of that whole workflow.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: So I want to ask you about generative AI. Obviously, it was the huge theme of 2023. Still going to be a big theme into 2024. And I want to get your thoughts on how that kind of fits into the automotive side of things for NVIDIA as well.\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: Yeah, so generative AI, we've just started. And I think the important thing to recognize, it's not just about text in and text out. That's, you know, what ChatGPT kind of started. It has amazing capabilities. There's a lot of room for improvement-- of course, something that's trained on, just a vast array of data. Some of it real. Some of it not-- means the results aren't going to always be accurate.\n\nSo what we're doing is putting together tools in place to be able to curate data and be able to make sure that if you're going to talk to your Mercedes, you wanted to make sure it has accurate information. So Mercedes can train this large language model with the history of Mercedes vehicles with all the information about the CLA concept, the manual, the service manual, whatever it is so that when you have a dialogue with that vehicle, it comes back with the right answer.\n\nBut beyond that, we're using generative AI for other data streams that we can put text in and imagery out, text in and video out. Could be video in and text out. So there's so many different ways that generative AI can be used.\n\nImagine, we have an automated vehicle. The front-facing camera is taking in 30 frames a second of video. We can then use a large language model to convert the pixels in that video into an explanation of what's happening in the scene.\n\nSo basically, the car can explain to you why it's making certain driving decisions or tell you what's going on in the scene to improve your trust and confidence in the system or provide alerts that mean something other than just the beep. So there's so many different ways that generative AI is really helping the auto industry from a designer that may do a sketch. And the generative AI will create a 3D model and in different permutations on that. It becomes a copilot for them, an assistant that is able to make their job and their productivity much better.\n\nSo it's not going to take their job away. But it's going to make them more productive and create higher quality results. And in the case of all the safety systems, all these tools are going to increase the safety inside the vehicle.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: You know, on the automotive side and almost kind of the automotive consumer side, I know NVIDIA also introduced an automotive configurator. It's kind of the idea of being able to build your car on a company's website but in a more advanced way. So can you just kind of explain that to us?\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: Sure. So we're leveraging the exact same data that's used to build the car and putting those models into more of a marketing role as opposed to engineering role. We can photorealistically render it.\n\nPeople can choose all different aspects of their car, kind of create their dream car. Maybe on their PC, they're doing it. Maybe even on a VR headset experience, look all around, see what that vehicle is going to be like to drive. And maybe even using our simulation technology to take it on a virtual test drive in a digital twin of the city that they live in or see what it looks like parked in their driveway.\n\nSo generative AI is going to help create all these different kinds of scenes and be able to help the automakers increase, you know, the types of options that are added to the vehicle. Because if people can kind of see it and maybe experience it, we could simulate different features and functions in the car actually working. And people could add that to their cart as they're ordering their vehicle.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: And, you know, one of the things that NVIDIA is highlighting is just the breadth of different automakers that you work with. I guess, how do you see those relationships continuing to grow over time?\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: Well, you know, we're working with hundreds of automakers, truck makers, robotaxi companies, shuttle companies and then-- so the whole ecosystem, the tier one suppliers, the sensor companies, the mapping companies, a lot of software developers, they're all building on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. So we've created this open system such that it's not a fixed function but rather a supercomputer that delivers the horsepower, the computing horsepower to run the software that's required today but also with headroom so that it can continue to evolve and develop in the future.\n\nSo a year from now, we might be sitting here at CES talking about all kinds of new AI technology that no one's thought of yet. But we'll be able to update the software in the car to add those new features and capabilities.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, unfortunately, you can't do that for my '07 Mustang. That's not really very well connected. But Danny Shapiro, VP of automotive at NVIDIA, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nDANNY SHAPIRO: Thanks, Dan. It's great to be with you.",

        "content": "Despite how strong the stock market grew in 2023, there were more than a few pockets of despair in the market. We know the S&P 500 was driven higher almost wholly on the strength of the Magnificent 7 stocks, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 also experienced superb gains.\n\nOf course, the seven high-growth tech stocks also influenced some of those indices’ gains. Where the S&P and Nasdaq are market cap-weighted, the Dow is price-weighted. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $185 a share, weighs in at over 3% of the Dow but has a 9% weighting in the Nasdaq. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), on the other hand, accounts for 4% of the Nasdaq but, by tripling in value last year, lifted the index to new heights.\n\nWhile I had some surprises with my portfolio’s winners last year as a result, some of my biggest losers raised eyebrows too. Let’s see if any of these down-and-out companies from last year can turn into rebounding stocks this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) 5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAuto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) was the stock that caught me off guard the most. Shares declined 18% last year, making it the third worst-performing stock in my portfolio.\n\nThe distributor of automotive and industrial replacement parts through its chain of NAPA Auto Parts stores has long been one of my best holdings. The stock’s biggest drop, however, followed third-quarter earnings. Despite missing Wall Street’s expectations, sales and profits both rose, margins widened and it produced $733 million in free cash flow (FCF) during the first nine months of 2023.\n\nIt’s likely inflation and rising interest rates finally took a toll because the market remains favorable for GPC stock. The cost of both new and used cars remains elevated even if they hit below the highs. That means current owners are incentivized to keep their existing cars running for as long as possible.\n\nI consider Genuine Parts the leading candidate to rebound this year. It’s also a solid dividend stock with a 68-year history of increasing its payout. With sufficient FCF to support the dividend, it’s in no danger of following the route of my next worst-performing stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the largest pharmacy chains, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has been a disappointing holding for years. Although healthcare is a necessity regardless of market conditions, Walgreens has struggled in recent years. Competition from CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) was fierce. Foot traffic lagged, it settled for $5.7 billion in its role in the opioid crisis and its medical clinics underperformed.\n\nThat all weighed on Walgreens’ finances too leading to its bombshell announcement it was slashing its dividend nearly in half. The stock is now down 7% in 2024.\n\nBut don’t count the pharmacy chain out just yet. As painful as the dividend cut is, it was necessary to conserve cash. The stock just might be in a better position to grow throughout the rest of the year. I’m not expecting it to top the charts, but if it finally spins off its U.K.-based Boots pharmacy as planned, sheds the Beauty No7 brand and continues its cost-cutting plans, Walgreens could see shares grow again this year.\n\nOrion Office REIT (ONL) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nThe biggest loser in my portfolio was Orion Office REIT (NYSE:ONL), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates U.S. office properties. It’s also the only one of the three losing stocks I didn’t buy. I got shares when another holding, Realty Income (NYSE:O), spun off its office property operations in 2021.\n\nYet it’s not surprising why it’s done so poorly. As a REIT specializing in acquiring single-tenant net lease office properties, it relies heavily on debt to finance operations. That exposes the REIT to higher interest costs and credit risks, especially in a rising interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve ratcheted rates higher last year in an unprecedented series of spikes, impacting Orion’s finances.\n\nAlthough the Fed hinted at possible rate cuts this year, there’s too much uncertainty now. Even so, rates won’t go appreciably lower to improve the REIT’s position. It does have a strong portfolio of properties in attractive markets, high occupancy rates and stable cash flows. The macroeconomic situation, however, may be too tough to fight. I expect Orion Office REIT to be a laggard once again this year. I remain hopeful for the long run, however.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a long position in GPC, WBA, ONL and O stock.

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nGANDHINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian data centre operator Yotta's plans to purchase more AI chips from its partner Nvidia will be worth $500 million, taking its total order book with the U.S. firm to $1 billion as Yotta beefs up AI cloud services, its chief executive told Reuters.\n\nYotta said last month that it would place an order for Nvidia chips but did not give a value for the deal or say which chips it would buy.\n\nSunil Gupta, CEO and co-founder of Yotta, told Reuters on Thursday that the order would comprise nearly 16,000 of Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips H100 and GH200 and will be placed by March 2025.\n\nIt comes on top of an order Yotta placed last year with Nvidia for about 16,000 H100 chips, due for delivery by July this year, Gupta said.\n\nAI deals in India are crucial for Nvidia, which is facing roadblocks in certain chip exports to China and some other countries due to U.S. restrictions.\n\nLast September the U.S. chipmaker struck AI partnerships with Indian conglomerates Reliance Industries and Tata Group to develop cloud infrastructure and language models, as well as generative AI applications.\n\nYotta, part of Indian billionaire Niranjan Hiranandani's real estate group, is a partner firm for Nvidia in India and runs three data centre campuses, in Mumbai, Gujarat and near New Delhi.\n\nGrowing storage and processing demand has prompted the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon to ramp up cloud and data centre investments in India in recent years. Indian billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani too have joined the race.\n\nNvidia globally has a near-monopoly on the computing systems used to power services like ChatGPT, OpenAI's blockbuster generative AI chatbot. Yotta estimates AI adoption in India to reach $14 billion by 2030.\n\n\"India's AI ambition is just not possible unless this infra comes to India,\" Gupta said, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit. The event, held in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state, is one of his last major efforts to draw investments before he stands for re-election later this year.\n\nShankar Trivedi, a top Nvidia executive, said at the Gujarat event on Wednesday that Yotta is setting up an AI data centre in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, a new tech city, which will go live by March.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in Gandhinagar, Gujarat; Writing by Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Susan Fenton)",

Finally, the price settled at 46,599.84 to close the day. The game-changing decision of the SEC will allow individuals, money managers and other financial institutions to get exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nThe SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been an ardent critic of cryptocurrency. For a long time, the agency was also reluctant to the approve so-called spot bitcoin ETFs. However, the situation changed after the SEC lost a lawsuit to Grayscale on August 2023.\n\nThe court condemned the agency for blocking bitcoin ETFs and allowed funds that track bitcoin futures.

        "content": "The semiconductor market is staging a solid rebound after a not-so-impressive first half of 2023. Semiconductor sales rose a solid 5.3% year over year in November 2023, the first time since August 2022, as demand rebounded on easing inflation, the Semiconductor Industry Association said on Jan 9.\n\nSales totaled $48 billion in November compared to $45.6 billion a year ago. Also, sales jumped a solid 2.9% month over month in November from October’s total of $46.6 billion.\n\nThe year-over-year jump in sales in November was driven primarily by robust demand from China, where sales were up 7.6%. Besides, sales rose 7.1% in Asia Pacific and 5.6% in Europe, while it witnessed a 3.5% rise in the Americas.\n\nThe semiconductor market, which reached unprecedented heights during the peak of the pandemic, suffered from a supply-chain crisis in 2021, which saw sales slowing at a fast pace. Although demand was high in 2022 and the supply-chain crisis eased, rising prices and inflationary pressures started taking a toll on sales.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign that saw rates being hiked by 525 basis points further slowed sales.\n\nHowever, semiconductor demand was always high from multiple industries, which saw the industry making a steady rebound from the second quarter of 2023 and sales have since been on the rise.\n\nDemand for semiconductors is expected to rise through 2024, which bodes well for the industry. The semiconductor market is expected to experience positive outcomes due to the global integration and extensive utilization of consumer electronics.\n\nMoreover, the growing influence and broad implementation of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and machine learning are foreseen to be significant factors in sustaining the ongoing demand for semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), global semiconductor sales are projected to jump 13.1% in 2024. WSTS estimates global sales to reach $588.4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks.

        "content": "You probably made a pretty penny if you invested in semiconductor stocks in 2023. And if you want to keep the profits rolling in during 2024, find the best semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nSemiconductor stocks can be smart for those who are looking for solid growth stocks. As technology evolves, semiconductors continue to play an important role in modern society.\n\nFor instance, electric vehicles largely depend on semiconductors. A single vehicle needs several hundred semiconductors to power its electronics, battery management systems, and driver-assistance systems. Semiconductors are also critical for the evolution of smart cities, intelligent transportation systems, generative AI and machine learning.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you’re looking for the best semiconductor stocks to buy in January, the Portfolio Grader can point the way. It’s a free tool that evaluates stocks based on various measurements, including growth, earnings performance, momentum and sentiment.\n\nThese are the best choices today for investors looking to make a splash with semiconductor stocks.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has long been one of the top semiconductor stocks. But it lagged the competition (which was the next name on this list) in 2023 because it couldn’t immediately compete in the lucrative generative AI field.\n\nThat’s changing in 2024. AMD is getting its Instinct MI300 accelerators on the market this year and they can run generative AI applications. There are projections that the company could ship as many as 400,000 units in 2024.\n\nThe competition’s chips sell for tens of thousands of dollars each, so it’s very possible that AMD’s initial projection of $2 billion in revenue on the chips will be conservative.\n\nAMD also has high hopes for its Ryzen 8040 Series processors for laptops, which would give it another major revenue stream.\n\nAMD stock is up more than 120% in the last year, and it’s already bounced back from a weak start in 2024.

Nvidia has the lion’s share of the market for chips that can operate generative AI applications, which led to the company’s amazing gains in 2023.\n\nNVDA stock jumped 269% in 2023 as generative AI emerged. The company’s semiconductors were in keen demand, and the company’s revenue jumped in the third quarter to $18.12 billion, up 206% from a year ago.\n\nNvidia is now the sixth-largest publicly traded company in the world. So is it reasonable to expect gains to continue this year?\n\nI think so. Maybe not at the same rate as 2023’s gains, but Nvidia will still have a strong year. Nvidia has figured out how to work around the import bans affecting the China market. With an 85% market share in the accelerator chip market, AMD has a long way to go to make a serious dent.\n\nNvidia also has attractive fundamentals, trading at only 24 times FY2025 earnings.

Its products are used to support data centers, networking, software, broadband, storage, wireless and industrial applications.\n\nBroadcom saw its business grow by 8% last year as the demand for accelerators and network connectivity for AI products drove interest in its product line. Broadcom is also expecting big returns from its now-closed purchase of VMWare, which it believes will increase revenue from $35.8 billion in 2023 to $50 billion in 2024.\n\nRevenue in the third quarter was solid at $8.87 billion, up 5% from a year ago. Broadcom also offers a nice dividend of nearly 2%.

Profits also fell, from $13.6 million in the first half of 2022 to $990,000 in the first six months of 2023.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency market has changed markedly over the last few months. Bitcoin rose over 50% in the last six months and now trades at more than $45,000. That’s going to help Ebang’s bottom line tremendously.\n\nEBON stock is up 47% in the last 12 months and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nApplied Optoelectronics (AAOI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Really an Expensive Stock in 2024?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) had an epic 2023 as it rode the wave of new generative AI infrastructure. Demand was insatiable. AI chip sales -- logged under its \"Data Center\" segment -- soared from $3.6 billion in Q4 fiscal 2023 (which ended Jan. 2023) to $14.5 billion nine months later in Q3 fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 2023). Chart source: Nvidia. Chart highlights on Data Center by author.\n\nBased on management's guidance, revenue for full-year fiscal 2024 (ending in Jan. 2024) will come in at roughly $59 billion, a massive increase from $27 billion in the year prior. However, it's a meager amount for a company that currently touts a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion. How expensive is Nvidia stock as 2024 gets underway?\n\nIt's all about the outlook\n\nThere is quite the disconnect between Nvidia's revenue and that of the other few companies that have surpassed the $1 trillion market cap milestone (all of which are part of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\"). Even assuming Nvidia has already reported full-year results and has achieved the $59 billion in sales it's forecasting, it's still a very distant fourth place behind the other tech giants with a $1 trillion market cap. NVDA Market Cap Chart\n\nTo understand why Nvidia is getting a pass for this very rich valuation, remember that it's in the driver's seat of a massive new secular growth trend: the buildout of AI and general-purpose accelerated computing infrastructure, primarily in data centers.\n\nIt's currently estimated that the world's existing data centers (both for public cloud and for private business use) are worth about $1 trillion. But Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as well as others inside and outside the semiconductor industry, have stated a belief that new data centers powered by accelerated computing (Nvidia's longtime specialty) are rapidly being built to either replace or augment that existing $1 trillion market.\n\nThat data center computing infrastructure needs to be replaced every five years or so (equating to about $200 billion in annual spending), plus or minus a year or two depending on usage, technology upgrade trends, economic conditions, and so on. And as we're early on in this upgrade cycle fueled by AI, there's a belief among some on Wall Street that data center upgrades will continue at a rapid pace in 2024 and push that total global data center value far beyond $1 trillion. Even Huang and the top team at Nvidia have stated an expectation that data center revenue will continue to rise sequentially throughout 2024 (fiscal year 2025 for Nvidia), driven by more AI use cases.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to AI, Nvidia also provides ample amounts of equipment to traditional data center operators. And let's not forget the company's other sales segments, two of which (\"Gaming\" and \"Professional Visualization\") could catch a strong tailwind as the PC market downturn of the last year-plus has bottomed and is showing signs of life again. Together, these two PC-oriented segments could generate significant sales this year (Gaming and Professional Visualization hauled in $8.7 billion during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, and neither were in top form). Chart source: Nvidia. Chart highlights on Gaming and Professional Visualization by author.\n\nAll told, this is what Wall Street analysts are thinking about when they give Nvidia a consensus revenue estimate of over $90 billion for fiscal 2025. And with the general conclusion that there will be plenty more accelerated computing market expansion over the next five to 10 years, it explains why Nvidia fetches a significant premium.\n\nBut can Nvidia pay the bills?\n\nThere's another important reason investors are giving the stock a pass on its rich valuation: profit potential. The company is the world's most valuable semiconductor business, but there's far more going on these days. Huang has helped direct Nvidia into a \"full-stack computing\" business, running the gamut from hardware design to software development and subscription sales.\n\nIn fact, of those companies with a $1 trillion-plus value, Nvidia currently cranks out more cash as a percentage of total sales than even software giant Microsoft (software tends to generate higher margins than hardware). Granted, Nvidia's historically hardware-based sales and profitability are far more cyclical than Microsoft's, but Nvidia's profit potential is nevertheless impressive. NVDA Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nFew semiconductor companies even come close to matching Nvidia in this department. AMD and Intel, both of which many investors hope can make some AI hay of their own even though they lag far behind in the software department, pale in comparison when it comes to operating margin and free cash flow generation. NVDA Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nBased on its explosive growth and high rates of profitability, Nvidia stock trades for about 26 times one-year-forward expected earnings as of this writing. By comparison, the S&P 500 index trades for about 21 to 22 times expected earnings. Perhaps Nvidia stock isn't as expensive as it appears.\n\nThe big caveat to this valuation\n\nOf course, investors should also consider that at some point, a downturn will come for the accelerated computing market -- just as such cyclical downturns tend to crop up every few years for other enterprise computing markets, PCs, and smartphones. Perhaps by the end of 2024 it will become apparent if such a downturn is imminent.\n\nEither way, that's a big reason to be prudent with Nvidia stock right now, even though the valuation may look somewhat reasonable based on full calendar year 2024 earnings estimates. Beyond this growth cycle, though, and looking at Nvidia's evolution into a full-blown tech giant and software platform, there are plenty of reasons to like the stock for the long term. This is a top-notch semiconductor and AI software business to invest in for 2024, assuming your investment time horizon accounts for inevitable bumps down the road.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The metaverse is working to revolutionize the world, including sectors like entertainment and education. Here we look at the top metaverse stock picks for 2024 and beyond.\n\nThe concept of the metaverse has evolved in recent years into a tangible near-term reality pursued by major companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) (formerly Facebook) and decentralized autonomous organizations. The metaverse seeks to blur the boundaries between physical and digital realities.\n\nThis development presents new revenue opportunities for a diverse range of participants, including retail investors, gamers, digital collectors, and developers. Along these lines, metaverse stock picks discussed below offer a solid exposure to this next-gen technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile gaming has already incorporated elements of the metaverse, its potential applications extend to various consumer realms. The metaverse could revolutionize entertainment and education, offering immersive experiences that go beyond traditional learning methods.\n\nAmerican users engaging in social media, streaming, and gaming collectively dedicate approximately 11 billion days annually to consuming digital media. Additionally, they invest around 14 billion days each year in watching traditional linear television. This substantial amount of time holds the potential to shift towards the metaverse in the future.\n\n“We think the metaverse is most likely going to be a next-generation social media, streaming, gaming and shopping platform,” Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Internet analyst Brian Nowak said.\n\n“In some ways, we already live in a metaverse, as shown by the total time spent by daily active users in the U.S. on digital platforms.”\n\nDespite its promising prospects, it’s crucial to recognize that the metaverse is still in its early stages, and its actual value proposition remains untested. Investments in this space should be approached with caution, considering the speculative and high-risk nature of the metaverse’s current development.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere are the metaverse stock picks investors should consider for 2024 and beyond.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms, is an internet titan that operates various platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta Platforms is actively involved in exploring the metaverse.\n\nWith initiatives like Horizon Workrooms and the development of virtual reality experiences, Meta is working towards creating immersive online environments. In 2023, the company made significant strides in its long-term investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse.\n\nThese two futuristic technologies showed notable progress and, more importantly, began to converge. Generative AI, a key focus for Meta, found its way into popular applications, while mixed reality became central to a mass-market headset. Notably, the integration of AI into Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses allows for a perspective-altering experience.\n\nMeta is reportedly planning to launch its initial smart glasses featuring a display in 2025, coupled with a neural interface smartwatch designed for control. These smart glasses aim to offer users a comprehensive augmented reality (AR) experience. In addition, Meta envisions the release of its first fully-fledged AR glasses in 2027.\n\nAccording to recent reports, Meta’s Reality Labs – a segment that hosts all metaverse-focused projects – now lost more than $21 billion since the beginning of 2022.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX), established in 2006, stands as an online metaverse platform enabling gamers to craft and share virtual worlds within the Roblox community. Over the years, Roblox has experienced substantial growth, becoming a prominent platform for user-generated content and social interaction in the virtual gaming space.\n\nIn November, Roblox disclosed a surge in performance, with 70.2 million average daily active users (DAUs), marking a 20% YoY increase. The company reported a loss per share of 45 cents, surpassing the expected 51 cents loss. Revenue, measured as bookings, reached $839 million, exceeding the projected $830 million.\n\nIn FQ2, users clocked over 16 billion hours on Roblox, reflecting a substantial 20% YoY uptick. Despite a net loss of $277.2 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30, an improvement is evident compared to the $297.8 million loss reported for the same period in 2022. The company reported a consistent year-over-year figure, stating that the average bookings per daily active user remained unchanged at $11.96.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

The agreement suggests a positive trajectory for economic growth in 2024. This positive outlook makes now the best time to invest in the stock market, especially tech. These are the three tech stocks that are outpacing the competition that you need to invest in.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor firm specializing in the production of graphics processing units (GPUs). It has an array of products under its belt, appealing to both consumers and businesses.\n\nThis organization has rapidly increased in value in the past few years, with current YoY growth of 234.02%. Due to the premium quality and high performance of its GPUs, NVDA has risen to become one of the top-performing tech stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s financials support this. 47 Yahoo Finance! analysts are setting an average price target of $636.68, above its current price of $543.38. Additionally, it has a profit margin of 42.10%, with an operating margin of 57.49%. Management is quite effective, with a 69.17% return on equity and a debt/equity of 33.15%.\n\nApart from its flagship GPUs, Nvidia has also entered the AI market, which is projected to reach $738.80 billion by 2030 at a 15.83% CAGR. As it enters the market, Nvidia is conducting regular market surveys to gauge interest and is partnering with various firms to develop AI models by supplying them with chips.\n\nThe combination of great financials and amazing prospected growth makes this stock a buy.\n\nIntel (INTC)  Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley.

The rising investments in electric vehicles provide the semiconductor market with many opportunities. Additionally, the growing use of consumer electronics means that semiconductors will be more essential to manufacturers than ever.\n\nIntel’s financials have not fared well, but its key catalysts more than makeup for its earlier performance. The company’s revenue was only $63,054 million in 2022, a 20.21% decrease in comparison to 2021. Net income in 2022 was down 59.65% compared to the previous year, and short-term investments were slightly less. Although these financial prospects may seem dim, Intel has been on the road to recovery. The company has emphasized AI, one of the most promising technologies, especially in the semiconductor industry. For example, in collaboration with infrastructure DigitalBridge (NYSE:DBRG), Intel recently launched its generative AI company to support the company’s transition into AI. Intel has also taken steps to push AI into the automotive industry, acquiring Silicon Mobility, a company dedicated to making system-on chips with AI for electric vehicle energy management.\n\nParsons (PSN) A photograph of two jet fighters flying above clouds. defense stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nParsons (NYSE:PSN) is an American business focused on the technological development of defense infrastructure.

Valued at $34.58 billion in 2023, projections expect overall industry revenue to expand to $71.46 billion in 2032, marking a solid nine-year CAGR of 8.4%.\n\nFinancially, PSN improved on every metric during Q3 2023. PSN reported $1.42 billion in revenue, marking a YoY increase of 25.05%. Net income and diluted EPS also received massive surges of $47.45 million and $0.42 respectively, both increasing over 55% YoY. Overall, Q3 2023 proved to be successful for PSN, with the company outperforming forecasts on EPS and revenue by 12%.\n\nParsons is set up for success through recent announcements of AI integration into its services. With an emphasis on the development of artificial intelligence recently, Parsons implemented AI capabilities into its TEMPO software, allowing for enhancements to its combat advantage services.

        "title": "Nvidia reveals progress in China's self-driving chip market, setting up competition with domestic players",
        "content": "Nvidia, the US chip maker banned by Washington from selling its most advanced semiconductors to China, has revealed solid progress in the mainland's electric vehicle (EV) market with its self-driving technology.\n\nNvidia said at the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas that Chinese EV makers, including Great Wall Motors, Li Auto, Xiaomi, and Geely-backed ZEEKR, have snapped up its Drive Thor autonomous driving system to enhance performance of their vehicles. This sets up increased competition with local self-driving system providers such as Huawei Technologies.\n\nAutonomous-driving systems, seen as the brains behind future cars, have become a competitive sector as China pushes greater adoption of advanced self-driving technology. Nvidia added Drive Thor - which integrates automated and assisted driving, in-vehicle infotainment, and parking in one single system - to its family of automotive system-on-a-chip solutions in September 2022.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAs of June last year, Nvidia - which is unable to ship its advanced AI chips to China due to US trade sanctions - had about a 52 per cent share of the global navigate-on-autopilot (NOA) market and cooperation agreements with 25 automotive original equipment makers globally, according to data from Gasgoo Institute, a Shanghai-based research company.\n\n\"Nvidia remains predominant in terms of smart-driving chips in China,\" said Brady Wang, an associate director with research firm Counterpoint. \"But competition between Chinese manufacturers and foreign companies is set to intensify as they compete for a slice of the autonomous driving segment in China's EV market.\"\n\nChinese EV makers have been big buyers of Nvidia auto chips. For example, Nio's flagship sedans ET5 and ES7, Li Auto's L9 model and Xpeng's G9 vehicle all come equipped with Nvidia's Orin chips. Automotive chips are seen as a less sensitive area of the semiconductor market by US authorities when it comes to setting trade sanctions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2022, China sold about 7 million units of smart passenger vehicles equipped with assisted autonomous driving systems, which translates into a market penetration rate of 35 per cent. In the first half of 2023, the market penetration rate rose to almost 43 per cent, according to data from China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).\n\nThe MIIT in November issued a new policy that encourages EV makers to bring vehicles equipped with high-levels of autonomous driving to Chinese roads, in a major effort to accomplish Chinese President Xi Jinping's vision of building a strong and modern transport network.\n\nThanks to policy stimulus, Chinese autonomous driving system solution providers - including Horizon Robotics and Black Sesame Technologies - have stepped up their game and are set for greater competition with the likes of Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Intel-owned MobileEye in areas such as autonomous driving chips and full-stack smart car solutions.\n\nNvidia topped China's NOA computing solutions market with a share of 53 per cent in the first half of 2023, followed by smart mobility start-up Horizon Robotics with 31 per cent, and Texas Instruments with 9 per cent, according to data from the Gaogong Industry Research Institute (GGII), which tracks nascent industries in China such as EVs and batteries. Huawei and MobileEye ranked in equal 4th place with a 4 per cent market share each.\n\nHuawei has emerged as a leading player due to its experience in auto chip design and hardware systems after it set up a smart car solution unit in 2019, the year it was added to a US trade blacklist. Under these sanctions, Huawei could not buy most US-origin semiconductors and had to rely on its own smart-driving chips.\n\nPriot to the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show in April, Huawei launched its own home-grown smart driving platform, called advanced driving system 2.0 (ADS) and powered by a Huawei-made chipset MDC 610, according to a report by research company Counterpoint and a note in July by Kaiyuan Securities.\n\nIn November, Huawei announced it was transferring core technologies from its smart car business into a new joint venture with state-backed Changan Automobile. The new venture, in which Changan has a 40 per cent stake, is open to other car makers as equity investors.\n\nDespite still being in the red, the firm's car unit achieved sales of 2.1 billion yuan (US$305 million) in 2022 and 1 billion yuan in revenue in the first half of last year, according to company information.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "U.S. CPI ahead, SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Traders are awaiting key U.S. inflation numbers for December, which could play into how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate reductions this year. Elsewhere, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves several applications to create spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, in a landmark decision for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n1. Crucial inflation data ahead\n\nHeadline U.S. inflation is expected to have sped up marginally in December, while the annual underlying reading is seen slowing, as Federal Reserve officials search for signs of easing price gains before rolling out possible interest rate cuts this year.\n\nEconomists estimate that the year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) from the world's largest economy accelerated to 3.2% last month, up from 3.1% in November. Month-on-month, the pace is projected to increase to 0.2%.\n\nBut the rate of the so-called \"core\" measure, which strips out volatile items like food and energy, is tipped to drop to 3.8%, down from 4.0% in the prior month. On a monthly basis, core CPI is anticipated to match November's figure of 0.3%.\n\nFed policymakers will likely be closely watching the data, which could factor into how they approach rate reductions later in 2024. In a speech on Wednesday, New York Fed President John Williams argued it is still too soon to call for cuts because inflation is well above the bank's stated 2% target.\n\nWilliams' comments echoed sentiments from other rate-setters, who have recently moved to temper soaring market enthusiasm for potential reductions early this year. This optimism, fueled in part by a dovish Fed outlook last month, drove a rally in stocks in the final weeks of 2023 that has since lost some steam.\n\n2. Futures edge higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Thursday, with traders gearing up for the publication of the inflation data at 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT).\n\nBy 05:04 ET (10:04 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 40 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had increased by 8 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 59 points or 0.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main indices on Wall Street closed in the green on Wednesday. The benchmark S&P 500 rose by 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed by 0.8%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 0.5%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) touched a fresh record high after peer TSMC posted fourth-quarter revenue that beat expectations, while Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit its highest intraday level since 2021 following a price target upgrade from anaysts at Mizuho.\n\nAlong with inflation, investors are awaiting a raft of financial results from major U.S. banks later in the week.\n\n3. SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin was trading higher on Thursday after the top U.S. securities regulator approved the first exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, Bitcoin had risen 1.4% to $46,283.4.\n\nIn a decision that is anticipated to have sweeping implications for the wider crypto industry, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light on Wednesday to 11 applications from a range of issuers, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity as well as digital currency asset manager Grayscale.\n\nSome proponents of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, have claimed that the SEC's approval would spark a rush of demand into the token. Through a spot Bitcoin ETF, investors will have the chance to gain exposure to the digital asset without directly owning it. Detractors have, however, flagged that ETFs could persuade retail traders to pour money into a sector that has been beset with a spate of fraud-related scandals and huge volatility.\n\nThe decision, which was backed by SEC Chair and known crypto-skeptic Gary Gensler, marked a U-turn for a commission that has largely been reticent to sign off on a spot Bitcoin ETF for much of the past decade. It also comes after hackers temporarily took control of the SEC's account on social media platform X on Wednesday and falsely claimed that the regulator had already approved the applications, sparking wild fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin.\n\n4. Google announces lay-offs across multiple teams - reports\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is dismissing hundreds of its employees across several divisions to decrease costs and support an ongoing push into artificial intelligence, according to media reports.\n\nCiting a Google spokesperson, the reports said the lay-offs will impact workers at the search giant's core engineering division. Hundreds of roles at its Voice Assistant division, as well as the hardware team behind its Pixel phone, Nest smart home devices, and Fitbit watches, will be eliminated.\n\nThe exact number of employees losing their jobs was not immediately specified by Google, the reports said.\n\nGoogle's cuts extend a continuing trend of job reductions in the tech industry. On Wednesday, e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reportedly laid off several hundred employees at its live-streaming unit Twitch, Prime Video service and MGM studios.\n\n5. Oil rebounds following U.S. inventories build\n\nOil prices rose Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s weakness as attacks on shipping through the Red Sea persisted.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% higher at $72.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 1.8% to $78.18 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks settled lower on Wednesday after official data showed an unexpected weekly build of 1.3 million barrels in U.S. inventories, contrasting with earlier industry data that signaled a weekly draw.\n\nWhile the build was minimal, the data also showed a second straight week of large product inventory builds, pointing to softness in U.S. fuel demand. This notion was exacerbated by a severe winter storm on the east coast of the country, which further disrupted road travel in the world’s largest fuel consumer.\n\nHowever, the market remained supported by ongoing concerns about disruptions to Middle East supplies after Yemen-based Houthis mounted their largest attack yet on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. CPI ahead, SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ considers lowering FY2024 inflation outlook to mid-2% range - Jiji\n\nTrump's civil fraud trial: four key moments",

        "title": "3 Unshakeable Dividend Stocks for Lifelong Wealth",
        "content": "While many, if not most investors, appear bullish about the market’s prospects this year, it’s never a bad time to consider long-term dividend stocks. By that, we’re talking about profitable, relevant enterprises that you can trust. These aren’t necessarily sexy securities but they should help you ride out any turbulence or even outright storms.\n\nIndeed, one of the main benefits of so-called unshakeable long-term dividend stocks centers on the psychological factor. So long as you’re targeting reliable entities with an established track record, you’re likely to get something. Even if your portfolio takes a hit, you can generally bank on passive income. Like in a game of football, it’s good to know you have a speedy free safety covering the zone behind you.\n\nOn a related note, long-term dividend stocks offer lower volatility compared to, say, the latest fad in technology. Usually, we’re dealing with leaders of industry. They’re in the maturity phase of their business cycle, meaning they command significant influence. They won’t provide the best growth potential but they’ll keep the ship afloat.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that, below are long-term dividend stocks to consider.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) Albuquerque, New Mexico / USA - November 2 2020: Boxes of Band-Aids in Walmart in the pharmacy and over-the-counter medication aisle. Kenvue (KVUE) split from JNJ and now owns the Band-aid brand.\n\nSource: Giovanni Nastukov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpun off from pharmaceutical and medical technologies giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) operates the consumer healthcare unit as a standalone business. It must be said that the performance following KVUE’s public market debut hasn’t been particularly encouraging. While shares may be down 19% in the past 52 weeks, they’ve been gradually marching higher since late October.\n\nI expect this trend to continue. According to Precedence Research, the global consumer healthcare market size reached $284.16 billion in 2022. By 2032, the segment could hit $608.39 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.91%. Here, the advantage that Kenvue leverages is its brands like Band-Aid, Listerine, and Tylenol. In other words, we’re talking about brands that people know, people trust.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s also a very attractive idea for long-term dividend stocks, carrying a forward yield of 3.66%. Further, the payout ratio – while somewhat elevated – is acceptable at 59.27%. Unless you envision a future where no one gets the sniffles or boo-boos, you can trust KVUE.\n\nSempra (SRE) The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOh no! People are leaving California. Peruse the Internet and you’ll find plenty of stories about folks migrating away from the Golden State. Some of the most common reasons center on cost-of-living issues. Of course, partisan websites will pin the blame on Democrats and their liberal policies. And that would seem to put a bad light on San Diego-based Sempra (NYSE:SRE).\n\nFrom an almost lifelong Californian, I have a different perspective. It seems that more people are moving in than moving out. Anybody that has driven through the 5 (or heaven forbid the 405) freeway during rush-hour traffic knows what I’m talking about. And it turns out that I’m not just suffering from observational biases.\n\nThe latest estimate calls for San Diego County’s population to peak at 3.4 million in about 20 years. That’s quite a while, which makes SRE one of the long-term dividend stocks to consider.\n\nRight now, Sempra offers a forward yield of 3.12%. Further, the company enjoys 20 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s pretty reliable if you ask me.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nHere’s the thing about legacy tech juggernaut IBM (NYSE:IBM). If you’re looking for the “in” play in the innovation ecosystem, you’d probably look at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, Nvidia last time I checked barely pays a dividend. Plus, having gained so much in 2023, some questions exist if lightning can strike twice. So, if your priority is passive income that you can trust for years to come, IBM is worth a look.\n\nFundamentally, that’s because it’s relevant. Again, Nvidia and its ilk have taken the spotlight with their relevance toward generative artificial intelligence and whatnot. However, Big Blue has long conducted research and development in AI protocols. Also, it’s a stalwart in the machine learning segment. Notably, this space may reach a valuation of $204.3 billion by year’s end. And the sector could expand at a CAGR of 17.15% to 2030, resulting in market volume of $528.1 billion.\n\nYou want passive income? You’re going to get passive income with a forward yield of 4.15%. That’s well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Plus, IBM has been on the move since late October. Therefore, it’s one of the top long-term dividend stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Tech Stocks Destined to Follow in Nvidia’s Footsteps",
        "content": "Following the remarkable ascent of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) last year, it’s only natural for investors to consider the top tech stocks to buy for 2024. Yeah, I suppose that NVDA could again be a winner. It’s off to a great start and the underlying generative artificial intelligence sector should only blossom from here. Still, it’s risky to target just the usual suspects.\n\nWhile NVDA delivered blistering returns in 2023, most of the upside performance came in the first half. That’s not to say that the second half was a bust. However, the print was comparatively disappointing as other tech stocks to buy stole the limelight. Further, it’s only natural that astute investors will seek underappreciated ideas rather than heavily hyped ones.\n\nTo that effect, going for enterprises that might not be on everyone’s radar could be ideal. After all, you would theoretically be dealing with a lower baseline from which to extract profitability. On that note, below are top tech stocks to buy in the new year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to chipmakers, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) used to be on everyone’s radar. However, after many years of struggles, challenges and missteps, Intel lost ground to its competitors. In some ways, Intel has become the poor man’s Intel. And sure enough, analysts are skeptical (as they should be). INTC is billed as a hold with a $44.33 average price target.\n\nWhen analysts imply downside with their price projections, that’s a worrying proposition. However, I believe that bearish options traders are tempting fate when it comes to INTC. By selling high volumes of call options, these pessimists are setting themselves up for an obligatory risk. If they had merely bought puts, the risk is defined: the loss of principal. By selling calls, if the trade goes against the bears, they’re on the hook for contract fulfillment.\n\nIn other words, they may be forced to buy shares at the open market, only to sell them at the (lower) strike price. That’s an ugly proposition because anyone can look up options flow data to see how the bears are positioned. From a speculative standpoint, I’d say INTC is one of the tech stocks to buy, not sell.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRegarding unusual ideas for tech stocks to buy, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT). Now, I personally think the company is awfully relevant. However, that’s not really the assessment on Wall Street. While shares printed a positive return in 2023, the overall performance was choppy. Also, analysts – while assigning shares as a moderate buy – peg the price target at $57.25. Again, we’re talking implied downside.\n\nTo me, that doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. As a cybersecurity specialist, the addressable market should expand, not contract. Right now, revenue for the cybersecurity market is projected to hit $183.1 billion by year’s end. However, McKinsey & Company sees a global addressable market which may reach up to $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion.\n\nPlus, everyone can see the consequences of lax cybersecurity protocols. Last year, more than a few major enterprises suffered data breaches, resulting in serious financial damages. Given the vast importance of the sector, I would say FTNT is one of the top tech stocks to consider.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding mobile phone with web page of US eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving onto Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR), I wouldn’t call the company an underappreciated idea. Specializing in the development and manufacturing of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Archer has made significant progress. I’d say that it’s likely the best-positioned enterprise in the burgeoning air mobility space. But with shares more than doubling last year, some questions arise.\n\nIs it really one of the tech stocks to buy in 2024 or is this the year sentiment fizzles out? Conspicuously, ACHR hasn’t enjoyed the most auspicious of starts. Still, analysts regard the business highly, rating shares a consensus strong buy. In addition, their average price target lands at $8.13. Plus, the maximum price target is $10.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s a credible target. According to MarketsandMarkets, the eVTOL segment reached a valuation of $1.2 billion last year. Further, the sector could hit $23.4 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 52%. I’d say that’s reason enough to rank ACHR as one of the tech stocks to buy for speculation purposes.\n\nCanaan (CAN) web browser showing Canaan (CAN) logo on website\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Jarretera\n\nYes, I can go with another blockchain-mining specialist but I’m going to double dip with Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN). Why? When you look at most other blockchain miners, their performance has been absolutely phenomenal. However, CAN has been muted. Further, even with the recent upswing in the cryptocurrency market, at time of writing, CAN was down on a 52-week basis.\n\nThat might not seem encouraging when talking about top tech stocks. But here’s the deal. Canaan isn’t exactly a blockchain miner. Instead, it manufactures the specialized hardware that blockchain miners use to do their business. However, many blockchain networks have migrated their transactional protocols from proof of work (which emphasizes raw computing power) to proof of stake (which emphasizes network “loyalty”).\n\nWhile that does seem a downer for CAN stock, it’s important to remember that several cryptos use PoW protocols. Also, PoS (Proof of Stake) protocols are unproven relative to PoW (Proof of Work), raising long-term questions. Analysts agree, pegging shares a consensus moderate buy with a $4.25 price target.\n\nPlanet Labs (PL) (RKLB stock, space stocks) satellite over the Earth\n\nSource: Andrzej Puchta / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving onto the truly speculative ideas for tech stocks to buy, Planet Labs (NYSE:PL) intrigues because of its space economy play. Specifically, the company designs and manufactures miniature satellites called Doves which are delivered into orbit as secondary payloads on other rocket launch missions. From there, each Dove features a high-powered telescope, enabling groundbreaking earth images.\n\nBeyond just the scientific relevance, Planet Labs offers critical solutions for agriculture. By assessing the ground from a bird’s eye view, farmers can make more informed choices about operations and infrastructural expansion. In addition, the company facilitates military and defense-related services. Nowadays, you can’t hide from the satellites. Such intel can be useful across various geopolitical functions.\n\nFurther, Mordor Intelligence points out that the satellite-based earth observation market reached a valuation of $11.35 billion last year. By 2028, this segment could be worth $18.75 billion, representing a CAGR of 10.56%. Analysts also rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $4.74 average price target.\n\nRent the Runway (RENT) Person holding cellphone with logo of US e-commerce company Rent the Runway Inc on screen in front of business webpage Focus on phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be clear, Rent the Runway (NASDAQ:RENT) isn’t exactly a pure-play idea for tech stocks to buy. However, the company does offer a creative e-commerce platform, providing a subscription-based service for renting (or buying) designer brand apparel and accessories. Think of it like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for fashionistas. So in that sense, I suppose it is a tech play.\n\nHowever, Rent the Runway is extremely speculative and risky. In the trailing year, RENT lost about 81% of equity value, which is stunning. At the same time, RENT stock has rocketed higher in recent sessions. The reason? Fundamentally, the company is undergoing a restructuring plan, which involves layoffs of 10% of the company’s workers. Still, what’s really driving sentiment could be a squeezing phenomenon.\n\nAs I explained in my Barchart article, RENT could fly until at least the end of next week. How so? Bullish contrarians are trying to blow up sold calls expiring Jan. 19 featuring a $1 strike price. At the moment, it’s around 70 cents. So, a few big pushes and suddenly, the bears may find themselves panicking. That would be brilliant for optimistic gamblers.\n\nNuScale Power (SMR) A hand in silhouette holds up a phone displaying the logo for Nuscale in front of a display showing the company's website.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the more disappointing companies overall, NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) specializes in small modular reactors. While it’s also not a pure-play example of top tech stocks, NuScale leverages various technologies to bring improvements to nuclear energy. Specifically, by using smaller, pre-fabricated modules leveraging passive safety systems – which rely on natural forces like gravity and convection for cooling – the company is able to deliver nuclear power reliably and safely.\n\nAlso, a key advantage that NuScale’s SMRs wield is its light-water technology. By relying on proven and well-understood protocols similar to existing reactors, the company can minimize fuel development and regulatory hurdles. That said, investors haven’t been convinced (obviously). Also, a short-seller report blasted the enterprise for inking a contract with a data center service provider that has little chance of execution.\n\nStill, with so much interest in zero-emission directives, nuclear energy will likely play a role. And that could help NuScale in the long run thanks to the modular nature of SMRs. Long story short, these facilities can be integrated in areas inaccessible to traditional nuclear powerplants.\n\nIt’s super-risky but analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a whopping $13 price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But Wednesday's gains left the index just 0.27% away from its record close of 4,796.56 set on Jan. 3, 2022.\n\n\"What the market is doing, it's reassessing its 2024 expectations in terms of earnings and in terms of interest rates, and really looking to justify the surge in prices that we saw in November and December,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.\n\n\"It's sort of a good sign that the market is treading water early in the year because it implies that investors really don't want to miss out on anything else that could be good.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 170.57 points, or 0.45%, to 37,695.73. The S&P 500 gained 26.95 points, or 0.57 %, at 4,783.45 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 111.94 points, or 0.75 %, to 14,969.65.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe focus will turn to the December consumer and producer inflation reports, due on Thursday and Friday, respectively, which could help determine the monetary policy path for the central bank.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said on Wednesday it is still too soon to call for rate cuts as the central bank still has some distance to go on getting inflation back to its 2% target.\n\nMarket participants have scaled back expectations to a 67.6% chance for at least a 25-basis-point rate cut in March, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nOn Friday, banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are expected to report lower fourth-quarter profits.\n\nCrypto stocks were mostly lower, with Coinbase, down 0.46% and Riot Platforms off 1.21%, after the U.S. securities regulator said a hacked social media message was posted on its account regarding the eagerly awaited approval of exchange traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe stocks barely reacted to a CBOE notice that several spot bitcoin ETFs from multiple asset managers were approved.\n\nBoeing rose 0.92% following a 9.3% tumble in the prior two sessions, after CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged errors by the U.S. planemaker as more than 170 jets remained grounded for a fourth day.\n\nDocGo plunged 37.58% after Fuzzy Panda Research revealed a short position on the health services company's stock.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.4-to-1 ratio on the NYSE while advancers equaled decliners on a 1-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 31 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 108 new highs and 97 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 9.81 billion shares, compared with the 12.22 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 170.57 points, or 0.45%, to 37,695.73.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe focus will turn to the December consumer and producer inflation reports, due on Thursday and Friday, respectively, which could help determine the monetary policy path for the central bank.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said on Wednesday that it is still too soon to call for rate cuts as the central bank still has some distance to go on getting inflation back to its 2% target.\n\nMarket participants have scaled back expectations to a 67.6% chance for at least a 25-basis-point rate cut in March, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nOn Friday, banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are expected to report lower fourth-quarter profits.\n\nCrypto stocks including Coinbase and Riot Platforms each declined after the U.S. securities regulator said a hacked social media message was posted on its account regarding the eagerly awaited approval of exchange traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe stocks barely reacted to a notice from CBOE that several spot bitcoin ETFs from multiple asset managers were approved.\n\nBoeing rose following a 9.3% tumble in the prior two sessions, after CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged errors by the U.S. planemaker as more than 170 jets remained grounded for a fourth day.\n\nDocGo plunged after Fuzzy Panda Research revealed a short position on the health services company's stock.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "title": "The Top 7 AI Stocks (Not Named Nvidia) to Start 2024",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was by far the best AI stock of 2023. 2023 is over, but it was the year that artificial intelligence took off. AI stocks are facing something of a different environment in 2024.\n\nThe evolution of the sector continues and investors continue to seek higher sales as the leading indicator of success. By the way, that’s why Nvidia did so well last year: Demand for its products spiked sales while many other firms have yet to see top line results from AI.\n\nYet, other AI stocks continue to have plenty of potential to not only increase sales but to rise in price for other reasons. This article is dedicated to those firms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors just got a great chance to pick up AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock at lower prices. 2024 has started with something of a correction, especially in regard to tech and AI shares. The result is that AMD shares have fallen from $150 to $137 as I write this.\n\nMake no mistake about it, the so-called correction is primarily a result of investors securing gains immediately after the calendar tax year ends. It is not a reflection of the purported beginning of some long-term AI correction in 2024. That’s how I feel anyway and the fact that AMD shares are rebounding seem to confirm my suspicion.\n\nI continue to argue that AMD is the number one contender in the AI space at the moment. The company will release its mi300 chips at some point in 2024. That will give the firm’s shares a very strong positive catalyst in their favor. It’s very evident that the top tech firms across Silicon Valley are interested in the chips as a way to reduce costs as an alternative to Nvidia’s highly priced h100 chips.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a very good year for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and owners of its stock. Like every other share on this list, Broadcom is cheaper at the moment than it was just a week ago. That’s obviously an opportunity for all investors and arguably a reason to pick up AVGO shares in and of itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, I would argue that investors should pick up Broadcom because its acquisition of VMware and the finalization thereof, promises to make 2024 very strong. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware was finalized in November after much concern. Finalization of the deal was delayed three times. It’s very apparent that regulators worry about the potential of the company to become monopolistic in nature. Now that it’s been given approval and acquired VMware it should also be apparent that the company has been transformed.\n\nThat truth is reflected by the company’s guidance for the 4th quarter of a 40% increase in revenues, in part due to its VMware acquisition. The company is the leader in software infrastructure in the AI space, now has a much greater top line, and continues to pay investors a strong dividend that is growing rapidly.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominates many niches throughout the tech sector. The company carved out a spot in 2023 and into 2024 as a leader in AI. It’s hard to talk about AI stocks without mentioning Microsoft. There are dozens of reasons to potentially invest in Microsoft, AI being one of them. Here’s how I look at Microsoft in relation to artificial intelligence.\n\nOf course, OpenAI has dominated the conversation in relation to Microsoft and AI. Microsoft’s investment and integration of ChatGPT across its services was and remains the major story. Yet, Microsoft doesn’t, or hasn’t yet, benefited much from its investments on a top line basis.\n\nMicrosoft rebounded in 2023 with revenues up 13% and income increasing by 27% in the most recent earnings report. I think the increase in income is an important aspect to focus on. Microsoft has invested in applying AI to its suite of Office products which promises to increase efficiency at firms everywhere. That’s where I see the benefit of Microsoft’s AI prowess at the moment: the company helps other companies increase their efficiency thereby improving their respective bottom lines. In turn, that should increase Microsoft’s top line.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) drastically turned around in 2023 as the macroeconomic picture stabilized. Revenues are again strong across its family of apps business, which is the primary reason to invest in the company overall. Of course, interest rates are very likely to be slashed multiple times in 2024 and that again should pave the way for stronger ad revenues in the new year. In other words, there is a lot of reason for optimism around META stock currently.\n\nOne thing that arguably gets lost in the conversation surrounding Meta Platforms is just how much the company has invested in artificial intelligence. Make no mistake about it, the company has invested as much as anyone else in AI.\n\nIt’s no secret that Nvidia’s h100 chips are in high demand. However, it may come as a surprise to understand just how much of that Supply Meta Platforms procured. Nvidia sold roughly half a million of those chips during the most recent quarter. Of that, Meta and Microsoft bought roughly 60%, with 150,000 chips each.\n\nInvestors should expect the company’s Llama 2 large language model (LLM) to garner more and more attention in 2024.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA lot of times, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) gets relegated to the tier of has been in relation to chips and AI stocks. It was overtaken by AMD In late 2022 and has been playing catch up since.\n\nOne of the primary reasons to believe that Intel will be able to make headway in that regard in 2024 relates to AI and personal computers. Both Intel and AMD are releasing AI-enabled processors for the PC market in 2024. Those chips include something called a neural processing unit (NPU) which is integrated into the CPU.\n\nEssentially, NPU chips are more powerful and better suited to AI applications and promise to bring a wave of AI capability to PCs this year.\n\nThe release of those chips promises to make Intel interesting again after what was arguably a difficult 2023. During the most recent quarter, revenues slipped by 8%. Although the result was above guidance, it’s difficult to argue that declining revenues are a win. NPU chips promise to change that.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSimply put, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock continues to brim with massive potential as we move into 2024. I’d argue that as much as any other AI share, Snowflake has deep potential to provide massive returns.\n\nFew other firms are comparable to Snowflake in regard to scale and growth potential. More succinctly, SNOW is very well positioned to benefit from the resurgence of growth stocks in 2024. That resurgence will be prompted by the Federal rate cuts, which almost always galvanize growth stocks higher.\n\nSnowflake reported nearly $700 million in product revenue in the most recent quarter, rising by 34%. That’s an impressive rate of growth especially in consideration of the company’s size. Investors are well aware of the opportunity presented by the application of AI across data centers.\n\nHowever, I think some may not be aware of how much this company’s shares have fallen during this macroeconomic cycle. Shares were about well above $300 in 2021. It’s easy to argue that they have the potential to return there as the macroeconomic environment shifts back in its favor.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) approach to AI is heavily focused on training as many people as possible in artificial intelligence. Over the last few months a series of articles were written that all focus on the notion that Amazon is positioned to help prepare  the current workforce as AI evolves.\n\nThe company’s ‘AI Ready’ program aims to train 2 million people with the requisite AI skills necessary for the labor market by 2025. More information about that program can be found here. The purported benefits are expected to cut both ways: employers will get employees who are more able to adapt to the AI-dominated environments, and employees will be able to command greater salaries.\n\nIf you think about it, it’s a smart move that it could really move the needle for Amazon. The broader the net a company can cast, the better the potential returns are to the top line. Further, I think the most obvious potential of AI and the one that is nearest to fruition is the ability of AI to drastically improve efficiency of employees, not replace them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Small-Cap Stocks With Huge Potential Flying Under the Radar",
        "content": "Small-cap stocks are set to have their day in the sun this year, and not just because favorable economic and monetary policy conditions are set to put wind in their sales. Instead, investors are increasingly nervous about the high-flying large- and mega-cap tech stocks that beat all odds to rally substantially in 2023.\n\nBut the rally that sent the Nasdaq 100 soaring nearly 50% in 2023 came with a price – overvaluation. Today, the index’s average price-to-earnings ratio sits at a whopping 29.15, indicating that the tech giants might have rebounded too much, too quickly. By comparison, the small-cap index S&P 600’s P/E ratio stands at a comparatively slim 16.\n\nOf course, high rates put pressure on small caps, so the relatively low share pricing reflects economic finagling. But, if and when the Fed cuts rates (or just pauses their growth), expect small caps to surpass large caps’ performance quickly. Among those small-cap stocks, these represent the best bang for your buck, blending growth and value.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nClearPoint Neuro (CLPT) healthcare stocks: doctors posing. retirement stocks. Healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nClearpoint Neuro (NASDAQ:CLPT) started the year with a bang, as the small-cap healthcare stock reported its strongest year-end earnings in quite some time. The brain-focused HealthTech stock saw 2023 close with a 17% annual revenue increase, with biologics and drug delivery sales jumping nearly 50%. Better yet, most of that growth came from the year’s final quarter, which marked a 32% revenue increase and a 76% sales increase from biologics and drug delivery. Closing out 2023 with that kind of strength points to solid tailwinds for this small-cap stock in 2024. Though shares surged more than 10% on the heels of the solid earnings report, there’s still upside to be had.\n\n2024 marks a range of operational milestones the company expects to hit. These include FDA clearance for the company’s brain navigation visual interface, full marketization of its laser therapy system, and AI-enabled predictive modeling platform launches. If even a handful of CLPT’s lofty goals come to fruition in 2024, the small-cap stock could be one of the year’s best performers.\n\nStory continues\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) is a bit of a dark horse among small-cap stocks, as the company suffered mightily in 2023, and a wave of bearish sentiment keeps shares suppressed today. Detractors point to slowing installation rates, liquidity concerns and struggles to compete with Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) charging network. All are, of course, fair points. But if you want to bet on a stock set to surge if the Fed cuts rates, CHPT is a clear winner.\n\nChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer told reporters that the past few quarters represented a “wait and see” inflection point rather than a full operational downturn. He said, referencing the company’s prospects for 2024, “It’s getting better, as we’re getting more and more data around the economy, and it appears we’re heading for a soft landing.”\n\nElectrical charger installation is a costly endeavor, especially when competing with a giant like Tesla that can subsidize footprint expansion through car sales. But falling rates open new liquidity opportunities that, in turn, could kickstart rapid network expansion for ChargePoint.\n\nAehr Test Systems (AEHR) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) is set to capitalize on continued semiconductor enthusiasm but, unlike its larger brothers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Aehr is agnostic to which company wins the proverbial chip arms race. That’s because Aehr develops and supplies testing systems to ensure semiconductor reliability and quality. As chips become smaller, more intricate, and expensive, demand for high-end and advanced testing systems will surge. And Aehr is one of the few small-cap stocks ready to run based on that opportunity.\n\nThe company’s top- and bottom-line stats climbed across the board, with revenue hitting 45% year-over-year growth and GAAP net income climbing 63%. In the call, CEO Gayn Erickson did point to some potential headwinds as “the slowing of the growth rate of the electric vehicle market has had a negative impact on the timing of several current and new customer orders.” But Aehr is far more than EVs, as the company tests chips associated with 5G tech, AI, machine learning, and more. If the company can move past its EV concerns, Aehr is set for a winning 2024.\n\nJumia Technologies (JMIA) Jumia (JMIA) banner at the New York Stock Exchange\n\nSource: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.com\n\nJumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) is one of those emerging market-centric stocks that could buck wider asset trends and significantly outperform comparable eCommerce platforms in 2024. Some call the small-cap tech stock the “Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Africa.” But unlike Amazon, Jumia can still tap a consumer market that’s 1.4 billion strong and otherwise largely unserviced.\n\nThe company saw a turbulent few years as factors, including the pandemic and financial struggles, kneecapped its growth. But that ship seems to have repositioned itself, and today, Jumia has cut cash burn, built liquidity to seven quarters’ worth of runway, and expanded its physical delivery footprint. While there’s still a long road to go, Jumia trades right around penny stock territory, making it a compelling speculative small-cap stock, especially considering the recent Morgan Stanley outlook upgrade.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications.

ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) saw shares surge last year as the small-cap space stock completed the world’s first satellite-to-cell phone 5G call between two remote, rural points without tower coverage. Once its product proved viable, ASTS quickly pivoted into marketization mode, though shares have fallen since the stock’s maiden flight.\n\nMuch of that share price turbulence came from funding concerns to push ASTS into wider markets to reach consumers. But that funding debacle seems to have been settled, as the company provided an interim update on its strategic financing initiatives. According to the release, ASTS bulls should see the strategic investment deal close later this month alongside the company breaking ground on planned commercial service stations based on customer orders.\n\nWhile recent weeks marked a brief pause for ASTS, this small-cap stock is one with massive upside potential in 2024 and beyond, making the suppressed share pricing an ideal entry opportunity.\n\nEnovix Corporation (ENVX) Solid State Battery for EV Electric Vehicle, new research and development batteries with solid electrolyte energy storage for automotive car industry, cathode. 3d illustration. Top Battery Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Just_Super / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnovix Corporation (NASDAQ:ENVX) is a small-cap battery stock competing against larger manufacturers like Tesla, but with a unique twist. Whereas larger manufacturers focus on reducing or eliminating rare-earth minerals, like Tesla did last year, Enovix is redesigning the entire concept of lithium-ion batteries. The company uses silicone to develop 3D structures that house batteries, making them smaller, nimbler, and cheaper – perfect for applications like smartphones and wearables.\n\nLast year, the company secured FDA approval to leverage its battery tech in vital sign monitoring systems. Enovix also locked down a solid US Army contract to develop batteries to run next-gen soldier wearables and advance defense tech.\n\nThough it saw those wins, Enovix remains firmly within the R&D space, though it’s beginning wider productization. Still, Enovix is a speculative small-cap stock, but as the company improves its innovative battery systems, total marketability could prove huge.\n\nRocket Lab (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) is set for a solid 2024 as the company secured a $515 million government contract to design and build 18 satellites over the next few years. Though the company marked two milestones last year — ten launches in a single year and the 42nd overall launch — this contract elevates Rocket Lab’s overall position within the wider space industry. No longer seen as a younger brother to mega-companies like SpaceX, the recent government stamp of approval proves this company has the competence and staying power to keep growing throughout the decade.\n\nRocket Lab also has a customer backlog of more than 40 satellites, proving the small-cap space stock’s newfound popularity among commercial and government customers and clients.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Watch in the Electric Vehicle Revolution",
        "content": "Truly, 2023 wasn’t the greatest for the electric vehicle (EV) industry.\n\nAs automakers struggled amidst the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike, a high interest rate environment dropped consumer spending and EV demand. While the strike did cost millions to the automakers, the drop in demand also caused the profits and subsequently, EV stocks to drop. Several automakers cut down on their EV investments as well as 2024 production targets.\n\nSo now, many EV makers struggle to meet production targets despite government support. Yet, the sales figures prove that EV adoption is growing, as the U.S. sold one million units for the first time ever. Growing at a rapid pace, the industry has immense competition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, only a few companies will be able to win. If you are ready to join the EV revolution, let’s examine three EV stocks to watch this year.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is now the biggest EV seller and the second largest battery maker in the world. As Warren Buffet’s favorite EV company, it’s proven its strength with impressive deliveries and high profit margins.\n\nThis past quarter, the company delivered 526,000 EVs, claiming the top spot. Also, it’s seen a strong rise in international exports, and this underscores the increasing demand for BYD cars globally. Manufacturing over a million EVs in 2023’s first nine months, it saw a 100% profit surge year over year (YOY).\n\nWhile catering to the Chinese market, BYD also eyes new markets and plans new factories in Thailand and Brazil. In fact, it has already started deliveries in Mexico.\n\nThus, BYD is only getting ready to race higher. Trading for $26, the stock is down 20% in the past six months, and this discount represents an opportune chance to buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is one of the best EV makers in China and could rule in 2024. It has impressed the market with strong delivery numbers and even better financials.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, Li Auto reported 131,805 deliveries in Q4, up 184.6% YOY while yearly deliveries stood at 376,030 cars. Also, it saw an impressive 546% YOY rise in gross profit in Q3.\n\nThe company enjoys a solid industry position and will report an impressive fourth quarter. Recently, it announced a partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for autonomous driving. While not their first partnership, LI has already used their tech in its previous cars. So, this appears as a brand new move to improve sales.\n\nNvidia’s centralized car computer will power the next range of EVs for LI, possibly working as a catalyst in the long term. Consumers will be happy to take advantage of the best tech available in the industry. Additionally, Li Auto will start deliveries of Li Mega on March 1 as it gears up for a solid year ahead.\n\nCurrently, LI stock is trading at $33, down 7% year to date (YTD) and looks highly undervalued. It’s worth buying the stock at this level as it will likely move upward as the market conditions improve.\n\nTesla (TSLA) TSLA stock: Tesla Super Charging station on Stockdale Hwy and the 5 fwy. Tesla Supercharger stations allow Tesla cars to be fast-charged at the network within an hour.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) might be ranked second place, but it remains an undisputed champion in the EV industry.\n\nThe company resorted to price cuts in 2023 which led to a lower profit margin. While it has affected the stock, Tesla can bounce back in no time. The year wasn’t exactly bad for Tesla either. It achieved a market cap of about $800 billion, and the company diversified into Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nDespite a drop in profits, TSLA saw revenue growth. The EV maker managed to hit the yearly delivery target of 1.8 million vehicles and also launched the Cybertruck.\n\nTSLA stock is down 12% over the past six months and is exchanging hands for $234. The company is working on production expansion by building new factories. Also, it has opened the charging network to other automakers which will generate revenue in the long-term.\n\nFinally, Tesla will announce results on January 24, and we could get more clarity about its yearly direction.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 High-Growth Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio in 2024",
        "content": "Growth stocks made a big comeback in 2023, outperforming value stocks by 31%. This is the second biggest outperformance on record (data goes back to 1979) — only 2020 saw a bigger outperformance.\n\nCan the rally in high-growth stocks continue into 2024? With the economy remaining strong, interest rates poised to move lower and a soft landing coming into view, there’s every reason to believe that growth will again outpace value in the year ahead.\n\nWhile the market’s performance has been choppy to start 2024, conditions appear to favor a continued rally in the coming months, especially with employment remaining strong and consumers continuing to spend. The first big test of the year will come when companies report their financial results for the fourth and final quarter of 2023 in coming weeks. As we wait for those results, here are seven high-growth stocks to boost your portfolio in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat a difference a day can make. After being rangebound over the past few months, shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have broken out and hit a new record high on a split adjusted basis. On Jan. 8, NVDA stock jumped 6.4% higher to finish trading at $522.53 per share. As of this writing, NVDA’s price is now in the $541 range. These new record highs were achieved after the company announced new microchips that will power artificial intelligence (AI) on personal computers (PCs).\n\nInvestors exchanged over $32 billion worth of NVDA stock on Jan. 8, making it the most traded stock on Wall Street. Previously, Nvidia’s stock had been rangebound, trading between $475 and $500 per share. The share price had been unable to break above the resistance it encountered at $500 until now. Nvidia’s stock more than tripled in 2023 and the company’s market value stands at $1.3 trillion. The new breakout begs the question: How high will NVDA stock go in 2024?\n\nStory continues\n\nFair Isaac (FICO) a pile of credit cards, credit card interest rates\n\nSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a high-growth stock that is not part of the Magnificent Seven, look to data analytics company Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO). The company responsible for everyone’s credit score saw its stock rise 95% in 2023. Over five years, FICO stock has gained 460%. The 70-year-old company behind the FICO score has seen demand for its consumer credit risk services skyrocket among customers that include banks and mortgage lenders as inflation and interest rates remain elevated.\n\nConsequently, Fair Isaac’s earnings have steadily grown. The company’s most recent print, for what was its fiscal fourth quarter, beat Wall Street forecasts across the board. Revenue totaled $389.7 million, which was up 12% from $348.7 million a year earlier. On the bottom line, the company reported net income of $101.4 million, or $4.01 per share, compared with $90.7 million, or $3.55 a share, a year earlier. With the housing market remaining strong, demand for Fair Isaac’s credit scores is expected to remain robust.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) A Bitcoin rests on top of a computer with the Coinbase (COIN) logo and a trading chart.\n\nSource: Nadezda Murmakova / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cryptocurrency market continues climbing higher, and so too does the stock of crypto exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). In the last 12 months, COIN stock has risen 304%, including a 90% gain in the past six months. The rise in Coinbase Global has coincided with a stampeding bull run in cryptocurrencies, which has been led by Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) 170% increase. Sentiment towards crypto has turned positive on expectations that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are coming to the sector in the U.S.\n\nBeyond the hype related to the likely approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in America, Coinbase Global continues to grow and expand its reach around the world. In December, the company announced that it has secured a license to operate in France as it pushes further into the European market. The move into France is part of Coinbase’s global expansion strategy that the company calls “Go Deep, Go Broad.” Coinbase is also in discussions with regulators in Abu Dhabi about a potential operating license there.\n\nHonda (HMC) honda logo on a sign outside a honda dealership\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for an automaker that has been flying under the radar. Global automotive giant Honda (NYSE:HMC) has gotten little attention in the media, but has quietly outperformed most other auto stocks heading into 2024. In the last 12 months, HMC stock has risen 30%. That compares with a 7% decline in the share price of rival Ford (NYSE:F). Yet despite the strong run, Honda’s stock still looks cheap trading at only eight times 2024 earnings estimates.\n\nHonda also pays a strong quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share, giving the stock a yield of 3.24%. Looking to the year ahead, Honda has big plans for its electric vehicle (EV) sales in North America. News just broke that Honda is planning to invest $14 billion to build a new EV plant in neighboring Canada as it looks to grow its presence in North America and target the U.S. market more aggressively. HMC stock offers the benefits of good value and high-growth to investors.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother mega-cap technology stock that remains a solid bet is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). While META stock enjoyed a big run last year, the company’s shares still look affordable trading at about 30 times future earnings estimates, which is a historically low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The company’s year of efficiency has proven to be successful and the stock has gained 175% over the last 12 months. With the digital advertising market expected to rebound in 2024, there’s reason to remain bullish on the Facebook parent company.\n\nMeta Platforms is also going all-in on AI, launching last fall a new virtual reality headset and several AI applications. Hopes are high for the Quest 3 virtual reality headset that’s priced at $499 and went on sale in time for the holidays. Meta is also launching several generative AI chatbots, as well as a text-to-image platform called “Emu” that will be integrated with the Messenger app, and new AI photo editing tools for Instagram. META stock has gained 300% since bottoming in November 2022.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Investors Buy Into Chipotle's Redemption, Even if Analysts Don't\n\nIf there’s a restaurant stock likely to outperform in 2024, it is Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). The popular restaurant chain has been a high-growth stock since its market debut in 2006. During 2023, CMG stock rose an impressive 65%. Through five years, the company’s share price has risen 342%. An aggressive and consistent growth strategy and earnings outperformance are largely responsible for the strong returns to shareholders.\n\nIn its most recent earnings print, covering Q3 2023, Chipotle topped Wall Street estimates due to higher prices and brisk sales of its burritos and tacos. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $11.36 compared to $10.55 that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue amounted to $2.47 billion, which was in line with forecasts. Same-store sales rose 5%, beating estimates of 4.6%. Chipotle said it expects to open 315 new restaurants in 2024 and reiterated its forecast for same-store sales growth in high single digits.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother strong outperformer heading into 2024 is Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST). The company just reported solid holiday sales that drove its revenue up nearly 10% from a year earlier to $26.2 billion in December. The sales increase in December was double the 5% revenue increase seen in November. Same-store sales gained 8.5% from a year earlier, which was more than double the 3.5% growth seen in November. Costco reports its sales figures monthly rather than quarterly.\n\nWith discounts offered on both food and discretionary items, foot traffic at Costco’s stores increased 6.5% in the U.S. and 7.5% globally during the month of December. Gifts cards, jewelry, and gold bars remain big sellers at the company’s retail outlets. E-commerce sales at Costco also continue to thrive, fueled by discretionary purchases. E-commerce sales rose 17.7% year-over-year in December. COST stock is up 38% in the past 12 months and has gained 215% through five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and FICO.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best innovative stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our introduction to what innovation is all about and why it's the most rewarded trait on the stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nInnovation is at the heart of human progress and share price growth. Firms that find unique solutions to business problems or customer needs end up improving their operational efficiency and creating new revenue streams. This leads to more return per dollar for a shareholder than would have been possible through other investment vehicles, in a self sustaining system that requires adept managers to dot all the i's.\n\nWhen we look at some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), one fact is clear. All of these companies created new manufacturing technology, platforms, products, and tools that were not present at scale in their industries.\n\nApple's example is worth a look here. Over the past decade, Apple's revenue has grown by 124%, providing its dividend shareholders with excellent value for their capital that is re-invested in the company through retained earnings. Apple had bled $1.8 billion in net losses during its fiscal years ending in the September of 1996 and 1997. Now, it's the world's most profitable non-state-owned company that generated $96.9 billion in profit during its previous fiscal year. Apple's success in the business world is attributed to its unique product design and the uncanny ability of its founder Steve Jobs to figure out key customer pain points before rival firms could catch on. The ability to design the right product and market it blends with the firm's complex supply chain that covers 50 countries and saw more than eight hundred independent assessments in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while Apple's shares and revenue are right at the top of the global food chain when it comes to innovation leading to triple digit growth, it is Tesla that is dominating the innovation space right now. The firm's revenue has grown by 826% on an absolute basis since 2010, since the market that it caters to is simply too big for Tesla to ever capture. Millions of cars roam the roads every day, and while it's easy to get an internal combustion (IC) car for low prices, a Tesla often costs tens of thousands of dollars. The lower cost market is a key Tesla objective, and its triple digit revenue growth is explained by the firm's innovation in manufacturing and mass producing a fundamentally different product in the market.\n\nWhile most companies on our list so far are mega-cap stocks, the one firm that isn't is Intel. Intel is the world's biggest processor company that designs and manufactures its own chips. This has been the case for quite some time now, and despite multiple slippages over the past decade, Intel still dominates simply due to its early found ability to double computing power every new processor generation. This ability enabled it to cement a market share right when computers were becoming powerful, and today, Intel is a corporate giant that controls the majority of x86 processor markets.\n\nLooking at these companies, it's clear that innovation is indispensable when aiming for success in the business world. Today, we'll look at which innovative companies are on hedge funds' radar and the notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 15 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now\n\nturtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best innovative stocks to buy, we ranked the top 30 holdings of the First Trust Innovation Leaders ETF (ILDR) by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of Q3 2023 end.

        "content": "Verizon Communications Inc. VZ announced the launch of 5G services through a newly constructed cell tower dubbed Dragon Tower at the U.S. Army’s Helemano Military Reservation (HMR) center in Hawaii. It is one of the 13 new or in-progress cell towers provisioned for connectivity enhancement in the region.\r\n\r\nHMR’s military housing accommodates around 2000 service members and families at Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield. The remote nature of the location makes it difficult to establish reliable connectivity.\r\n\r\nBeing stationed in a remote area can have an impact on the mental wellbeing of base personnel. Access to dependable, high-speed Internet allows service members to stay in touch with loved ones, significantly boosting morale. Moreover, access to emergency services is also deemed a vital necessity for deployed military personnel and their families.\r\n\r\nThe partnership between Verizon and Helemano intends to address these issues. The cell tower is constructed at the heart of the HMR on the premises of the Army and Air Force Exchanges’ HMR Express store. The initiative is part of a $1 million project. The infrastructure boost will empower base personnel and visitors with enhanced wireless coverage and network services. This venture solidifies Verizon’s position as a leading technology partner for the U.S. Armed Forces. This will likely boost the company’s commercial prospects in the near future.\r\n\r\nVerizon is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum. The telecom giant plans to accelerate the availability of its 5G Ultra-Wideband network across the country. Its growth strategy includes 5G mobility, nationwide broadband and mobile edge compute and business solutions. Verizon is building the entire network infrastructure and ecosystem to provide the most amazing 5G experience to customers. It continues to deploy the Home Internet service in select cities where users can experience a maximum download speed of up to 1 Gbps.\r\n\r\nVerizon’s 5G mobility service offers an unmatched experience that impacts diverse industries such as public safety, health care, retail and sports. The company’s 5G network hinges on three fundamental drivers to deliver the full potential of next-generation wireless technology. These include massive spectrum holdings, particularly in the millimeter-wave bands for faster data transfer, end-to-end deep fiber resources and the ability to deploy a large number of small cells.\r\n\r\nThe stock has lost 5.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 3.5%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVerizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.99%.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Intel",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were the toast of Wall Street last year. The segment was one of the biggest growth drivers in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% rise in 2023, with countless companies benefiting from increased interest in AI.\n\nHowever, data from Grand View Research suggests the sector is just getting started. The AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed a $1 trillion valuation before the end of the decade. So, even stocks that reached new heights last year could still have much to offer new investors.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) are two attractive options, with both companies developing the hardware necessary for training and running AI models. These companies are at considerably different stages of their AI journeys, with one dominating the industry and the other just starting out.\n\nAs a result, it's worth asking whether it's better to invest in an established AI stock or one with possibly more room for growth. Let's take a look at whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock this January.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia's business exploded in 2023, with its stock up more than 245% since last January. The company's years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) allowed it to get a head start in AI as its chips became the preferred hardware for developers everywhere.\n\nWhile chip rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have vested interests in the GPU sector, they have focused primarily on fighting over share of the central processing unit (CPU) market. This has allowed Nvidia a clear path to dominance in GPUs, perfectly positioning it to thrive amid an AI boom.\n\nIn its third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206% year over year, hitting over $18 billion. Meanwhile, operating income soared 1,600% to $10 billion. Much of the quarter's growth was owed to a 279% spike in data center revenue, reflecting increased sales of AI GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia will have to contend with a more competitive chip market this year as AMD and Intel begin shipping their respective GPUs. However, Nvidia has a major lead that will be challenging to overcome.\n\nAdditionally, with the market expanding at a CAGR of 37%, there may be room for Nvidia to retain its dominance as the market welcomes newcomers.\n\nIntel INTC Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nIntel hasn't had it easy in recent years. This chart shows its revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have plunged since 2020.\n\nThe company enjoyed years of almost unrivaled dominance in CPUs, which saw it grow complacent as its technology started to stagnate. In 2020, Apple acted on years of frustration with Intel's chips, ending a 15-year partnership in favor of chips developed in-house. Meanwhile, AMD's powerful line of Ryzen CPUs has seen the company consistently steal market share from Intel. Since the first quarter of 2017, Intel's share of the CPU market has dwindled from 82% to 61% in Q4 2023.\n\nHowever, recent headwinds have seemingly put Intel back on a growth path. The company ventured into the desktop GPU market for the first time last year and announced a range of new AI chips this past December. The soon-to-be-released hardware is designed to challenge Nvidia's hardware and could offer the company significant revenue gains over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Intel's finances seem to be on the right track. Despite an 8% revenue decline in Q3 2023, operating income was up 43% year over year. Its data center and AI segment also hit $71 million in operating income after posting losses of $139 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nIntel has a promising long-term outlook that is made stronger by the prospects of AI.\n\nIs Nvidia or Intel the better artificial intelligence (AI) stock?\n\nNvidia and Intel are two compelling ways to back the rapidly expanding AI market. However, EPS estimates suggest Nvidia might just be the better bet over the next two fiscal years and possibly beyond. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThese charts show Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Intel's may achieve nearly $3 per share. Multiplying those figures by their respective forward price-to-earnings ratios (Nvidia's 42 and Intel's 25) yields a stock price of $1,008 for Nvidia and $68 for Intel.\n\nIf projections are correct, Nvidia's stock would rise 96% from its current position within two years, while Intel's would increase 42%.\n\nAlongside its more established position in AI, Nvidia is the clear winner here. Its projected growth is through the roof, making it the better AI stock right now and a no-brainer investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "If investors could turn back the clock and return to the beginning of 2023, undoubtedly many would load up on shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia's stock rose nearly 240% on the back of increased GPU (graphics processing unit) demand, fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. While the stock has put up unbelievable growth, it has also become quite expensive.\n\nBut, a much cheaper alternative to Nvidia is benefiting from the same trend: Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Often called Supermicro, it also had a phenomenal 2023, with the stock up nearly 250%, outperforming Nvidia. However, it's still quite cheap compared to Nvidia, making it a great way to invest in AI if you've missed out on Nvidia.\n\nSupermicro competes in a crowded industry\n\nWhile Nvidia creates the GPUs needed to process the calculations for arduous workloads, companies can't just buy one, plug it into a computer, and expect it to be perfect. Instead, anyone who wants a supercomputer purchases multiple GPUs and places them in a data center server. Getting the architecture in these servers right is crucial for squeezing out top performance, and Supermicro specializes in this area.\n\nSupermicro works closely with Nvidia to ensure its architecture is optimizing performance. Supermicro also has highly configurable servers available for purchase that can be tailored to game development, generative AI, engineering simulations, or drug discovery. However, Supermicro isn't the only company in this industry, as other sizable competitors like IBM and Hewlett Packard are also attempting to capitalize on the boom caused by AI interest.\n\nStill, Supermicro is a pure play in this space, giving investors the best chance to capitalize on this move.\n\nBut if you expect another 250% stock movement in 2023, you must dampen those expectations.\n\nSupermicro isn't growing as fast as Nvidia, but is far cheaper\n\nWhile Supermicro is growing, it's not at the levels Nvidia has experienced.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nHowever, management has an ambitious goal for Supermicro to reach more than $20 billion in annual revenue, nearly tripling its current trailing-12-month total. It's well on its way to achieving that, as management is guiding for $10.5 billion in FY 2024 revenue (ending June 30).\n\nStill, this isn't even close to Nvidia's growth rate, even if it is respectable.\n\nSo why did Supermicro's stock do so well in 2023? It had to deal with its valuation.\n\nSupermicro entered 2023 at nearly an all-time low valuation of 6.4 times earnings. This was far below its decade-long average, setting the stage for a strong rebound. SMCI PE Ratio Chart\n\nHowever, Supermicro is now near the high end of its valuation range, making the stock look expensive. But that doesn't factor in the strong growth management expects in FY 2024, so looking at forward earnings is a better way to assess Supermicro.\n\nSuper Micro Computer trades at 17 times forward earnings, which indicates strong earnings growth in 2024. But that's just one year.\n\nManagement expects the boom in its business to last much longer than that, so the slightly expensive price you pay now will be much lower after just one year. As a result, Supermicro computer may be a great way to play the AI boom without needing to pay an expensive 65 times trailing and 41 times forward earnings like with Nvidia.\n\nSupermicro is set up for a strong 2024 and beyond, and if you're looking for an alternative to Nvidia, it makes for a great investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Just 10 days into the new year and a familiar stock is back near the top of the leaderboard: Nvidia Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSEC’s X Account Hacked to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETF Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff Bottled Water Contains More Plastic Particles Than Previously Thought US and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\n\nAfter struggling for months to break out above $500 a share, last year’s best performer in the S&P 500 has pushed decisively into record territory with a more than 7% advance. With its market value now at more than $1.3 trillion, it’s about $250 billion shy of Amazon.com Inc., the fourth-most valuable company in the benchmark.\n\nThe fact that investors are still bidding up Nvidia’s stock after it more than tripled in 2023 is testament to how high demand expectations continue to be for its chips used in artificial intelligence computing. Nvidia’s revenue jumped 206% in the third quarter and is projected to rise 232% in the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“This is a very large, fast growing market and they’re dominating,” said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management. “You could look forward to 2024 as another solid year of returns for Nvidia.”\n\nOn Tuesday, in an interview with a JPMorgan analyst, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress reaffirmed Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang’s assertion that the company believes it can continue to grow in calendar 2025 as demand for AI-related products remains strong.\n\nNvidia was dealt a blow last year when the Biden administration tightened restrictions on chip exports to China, threatening its access to a market that accounted for 21% of the chipmaker’s sales in the last fiscal year. Nvidia responded by creating less-capable versions of its graphics chips for PCs and has promised that similar ones for data center use will arrive this year.\n\nEarlier this week, Nvidia announced three new desktop graphics chips with extra components that will allow for better use of AI on personal computers without having to rely on remote services accessed over the internet. The Santa Clara, California-based company is expected to report earnings late next month.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s booming profits, projected to weigh in at nearly $28 billion in the current fiscal year, have helped temper its valuation despite its soaring stock price. Even though the valuation has fallen to about 27 times projected profits from 55 times in May, the stock is far from cheap. The Nasdaq 100 index is priced at about 24 times forward earnings.\n\nWhen measuring Nvidia’s current price against its past performance, the stock looks far more expensive. On a trailing basis, Nvidia is priced at about 68 times profit, while the Nasdaq 100 trades at about 33 times.\n\n“I still like the stock,” said Shana Sissel, chief executive officer of Banrion Capital Management, citing its valuation relative to revenue growth. “I do think it can keep the momentum up.”\n\nEven Nvidia’s biggest fans don’t expect the stock to repeat its 2023 performance. The average price target on Wall Street sits at about $650, implying a gain of 22% from current levels, one of the widest margins among the biggest US technology companies.\n\n“If our standard for a stock to perform is 200% every year, then we really need to recheck our expectations,” said Sissel, adding that she still sees Nvidia outperforming the broader market this year. “That, to me, is still a stock worth holding.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nCoinbase Global Inc., the poster child of crypto-linked stocks, has risen considerably above analyst price targets ahead of a highly anticipated decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on whether to approve a spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The run has been so powerful that the average return potential based on analyst targets suggests more than a 20% slump in the stock over the next 12 months.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nA highly anticipated decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on whether to approve a spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund quickly morphed into a major cybersecurity incident on Tuesday. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s fourth-quarter revenue beat estimates of a decline, as demand from artificial intelligence players helped offset sluggish smartphone and laptop chip sales. ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok became the first app to surpass $10 billion in cumulative consumer spending, helping power mobile app sales to a new high in a year revenue from games was down, according to the latest annual report by data.ai. Global chip sales rose for the first time in more than a year in the latest indication of demand starting to rebound on the back of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Apple Inc. returned to an annual list of the 100 best places to work after falling off last year, but the ranking wasn’t as rich with technology firms after layoffs roiled the sector.\n\nEarnings Due on Wednesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Ian King and Thyagaraju Adinarayan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTropical Underworld: The Murder Case That Could Topple an Alleged Crime Empire Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Comes Under a Microscope Private Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Is There Any Hope for Hollywood?

        "title": "2 Hypergrowth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The start of a new year is a great time to expand your portfolio by investing in companies likely to flourish over the next 12 months and long into the future.\n\nThe tech market is an excellent place to start, with its reputation for delivering consistent and significant gains over the long term. Its lucrative history means the industry has a wealth of attractive growth stocks to choose from that have solid outlooks in 2024.\n\nBudding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) boosted many tech stocks last year, with demand for the technology only likely to continue rising. According to data from Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it surpass a value of $1 trillion.\n\nSo it's not a bad idea to consider investing in a company prioritizing AI, with the sector attracting some of the biggest names in tech. Here are two such hypergrowth stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) seems like a no-brainer for anyone looking to make a long-term investment in tech. The company supplies its hardware to companies across the industry, for use in AI models, cloud platforms, video game consoles, laptops, and custom-built PCs.\n\nThat leaves it in a good position to profit from the tech market for years to come, with chip demand on the rise.\n\nNvidia's success has seen its stock rise more than 1,000% since 2019, with revenue climbing 130% to $27 billion. And stellar growth last year suggests the company is only just getting started.\n\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT triggered a boom in AI, with the platform causing many to rethink what was possible with the technology. Countless tech firms began restructuring their businesses to prioritize AI development and needed powerful chips like Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to do so.\n\nSoaring demand for GPUs and almost no competition saw Nvidia climb to the top of the AI chip market, snapping up an estimated 90% market share while rivals like AMD and Intel struggled to catch up. As a result, shares in Nvidia are up 230% since last January after multiple quarters of impressive growth.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThe chart above shows earnings per share (EPS) could hit $24 by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 40 yields a stock price of $960, with growth of 96% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nWith Nvidia's powerful position in multiple areas of tech, you won't want to miss out on this hypergrowth stock.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is the world's second-most-valuable company (after Apple), with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. The company is home to some of the most widely recognized names in tech: Windows, Office, Xbox, LinkedIn, and Azure, which attract billions of users.\n\nThe growth of these offerings sent Microsoft's stock soaring 260% over the last five years, with annual revenue up 68%. The company posted over $63 billion in free cash flow in 2023, giving it the funds to invest heavily in high-growth markets and overcome possible headwinds.\n\nThat has allowed it to invest billions of dollars in AI. It partnered with OpenAI in 2019, initially putting $1 billion into the start-up, and has since achieved a 49% stake in OpenAI, granting it exclusive access to some of the industry's most advanced AI models.\n\nMicrosoft has so far used the partnership to introduce AI across its product lineup, including improvements to its search engine Bing, new tools on its cloud service Azure, and an AI assistant added to its various Office productivity services through Microsoft 365. The assistant, called Copilot, was launched as a $30 add-on to a 365 subscription, the company's first steps to monetize its AI offerings. MSFT EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nAs with Nvidia, EPS estimates suggest Microsoft has much to offer new investors. This table shows its earnings could achieve $15 per share over the next two fiscal years. When multiplying that figure by Microsoft's forward P/E of 33, you come to a stock price of $495. If these projections are correct, the company's shares could increase 34% by fiscal 2026.\n\nThat growth might not come close to Nivida's potential, but it still beats the S&P 500's rise of 24% over the last three years. And with that, Microsoft is an attractive stock to buy in 2024 and hold indefinitely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Investors Should Be Encouraged By NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Returns On Capital",
        "content": "Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) look very promising so lets take a look.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on NVIDIA is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.46 = US$21b ÷ (US$54b - US$9.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).\n\nThus, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 46%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NVIDIA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nWhat Can We Tell From NVIDIA's ROCE Trend?\n\nThe trends we've noticed at NVIDIA are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 46%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 274% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat We Can Learn From NVIDIA's ROCE\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that NVIDIA is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a staggering 1,339% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nOne more thing, we've spotted  1 warning sign  facing NVIDIA that you might find interesting.\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Want to Beat the Average Stock Market Return? Here Are 10 Stocks to Help",
        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index has delivered a gain of 67,036% (including dividends) since it was established in 1957. That translates to an average annual return of 10.2%, compounded.\n\nThat's more than twice the return investors could earn if they held cash right now, even with interest rates at a 15-year high.\n\nBut, historically, investors who purchased specific individual stocks have far outperformed the return of the S&P 500. I'm going to share 10 stocks that have crushed the index since their initial public offering (IPO), and they have the potential to help you beat the market going forward, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms: 826% return since IPO\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Its stock came public in 2012, and it has since gained 826%, which translates to a compound annual return of 22.4%. That's twice the long-run average of the S&P 500.\n\nBut it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Meta stock fell 76% from peak to trough between 2021 and 2022 and then roared back to life with a 194% gain in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), the company delivered a record amount of revenue, and its net income (profit) surged 163% year over year.\n\nMeta stock is still cheap relative to the broader technology sector, and more market-beating returns might be ahead this year and beyond as the company ramps up its investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks: 1,920% return since IPO\n\nThe next market-beating stock is Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW), a world-leading cybersecurity company that came public in 2012. Its stock has soared by 1,920% since then, or by a compound annual rate of 31.4%, and it spent much of 2023 making record highs.\n\nInvestors have rewarded the company's growing investments in futuristic AI-powered cybersecurity, which are already attracting significant amounts of revenue. Palo Alto's one-year-old Cortex XSIAM product is a security operations solution designed to reduce reliance on human-led, manual incident response with the help of AI. It has already amassed $1 billion in bookings, with one large organization using it to protect 300,000 computers and devices (endpoints).\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto is on track to deliver a record-high $8.2 billion in total revenue during the current fiscal year 2024 (ending July 31, 2024). Considering that the cost of cyberattacks continues to soar, investing in one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the world might be a great move for your money going forward.\n\n3. Alphabet (Google): 6,311% return since IPO\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, but it's also home to other famous tech subsidiaries like YouTube and self-driving vehicle developer Waymo. Google stock came public in 2004 (it changed its name to Alphabet in 2015), and it has since delivered a return of 6,311%. That's equivalent to a compound annual gain of 24.5%.\n\nAdvertising dollars generated from Google Search remain Alphabet's single largest source of revenue, but a notable contribution also comes from its cloud computing platform, Google Cloud. It's growing in importance because it's where the conglomerate monetizes many of its AI initiatives, from new data center chips to large language models that form the foundation of AI software applications.\n\nLike Meta, Alphabet stock also trades at an attractive valuation compared to its big-tech peers, and that could pave the way for more upside going forward.\n\n4. Netflix: 44,146% return since IPO\n\nNext up is streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). It came public in 2002, shortly after the dot-com tech bubble burst, and its stock has delivered a red-hot gain of 44,146% since then. That translates to an annual return of 33.7%, compounded.\n\nNetflix has disrupted everything from video rental stores to cable television. Its streaming service has become the largest in the world, with 247 million paying members, and the company continues to grow its addressable market by offering cheaper subscription tiers and by expanding into new territories.\n\nNetflix is the only stand-alone streaming provider generating a profit, which bodes well for its long-term staying power compared to its peers, many of which are slashing costs right now. That could lead to more market share for Netflix over time and more gains for its stock. Image source: Netflix.\n\n5. Apple: 181,080% return since IPO\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's first $3 trillion company, and its stock has been one of the best performers in the history of the market. It has delivered a gain of 181,080% since its IPO in 1980, or a compound annual return of 19%.\n\nThe iPhone smartphone has become the company's biggest value creator, leading to other billion-dollar hardware products like the Watch and AirPods. Apple also has a booming services segment led by the subscription-based Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV. But AI might be one of the biggest reasons to own the stock going forward.\n\nThe company's iPhone 15 Pro features an Apple-designed A17 Pro chip that can process AI workloads on-device. It's reportedly working on a large language model and AI chatbot, and the ability to run such applications on the smartphone (as opposed to in the cloud) could mark a new dawn in mobile computing and pave the way for new features. It's hard to go wrong owning this tried-and-true long-term performer.\n\n6. Amazon: 193,553% return since IPO\n\nIt started out selling books online in 1994, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has transformed into one of the most diversified technology companies in the world. It came public in 1997, and its stock has soared by 193,553% since. That's a compound annual return of 33.8%, tripling the long-run average annual return of the S&P 500.\n\nE-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, but the company draws most of its profit from its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is spearheading the company's AI initiatives, from developing data center chips to helping businesses develop their own AI applications. Amazon even purchased a $4 billion stake in leading AI start-up Anthropic late last year.\n\nBut there's even more to this company. Its streaming service -- Prime -- is second only to Netflix in memberships, and its digital advertising business is one of the fastest-growing pieces of the entire company. Simply put, Amazon stock is a great way for investors to expose their portfolios to the digital economy, and it's trading at a very attractive valuation. Image source: Amazon.\n\n7. Nvidia: 196,288% return since IPO\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the star of 2023, logging a bigger gain than any other stock in the S&P 500. It has a history of spectacular growth; it came public in 1999, and since then, its stock has surged 196,288%. That translates to a 37.2% annual return, compounded.\n\nNvidia's business is currently driven by astronomical demand for its AI data center chips, specifically the H100 and upcoming H200. The world's largest data center operators have raced to give their business customers access to enough computing power to handle AI workloads so they can develop applications and integrate productivity-boosting AI into their workflows. Nvidia has a dominant market share in this area, and there are very few viable alternatives right now.\n\nIn the recent fiscal year 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's data center revenue surged by a whopping 279% year over year, to $14.5 billion. The company's Q4 forecast suggests it will end the year with a record $58.8 billion in total revenue, and Wall Street predicts it could deliver $92.2 billion in fiscal 2025. In other words, there appears to be plenty of growth left in the tank.\n\n8. Oracle: 221,826% return since IPO\n\nFounded in 1977, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is one of America's oldest technology companies. It executed its IPO in 1986, and its stock has since recorded a gain of 221,826%, translating to a compound annual return of 23.1%.\n\nOracle started out developing database management software, but today it's a leading provider of cloud-based applications designed to boost productivity in dozens of industries. Investors are intently focused on the infrastructure segment of Oracle's cloud business because the company says its Nvidia GPU chip clusters can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of other leading cloud providers.\n\nOracle has already signed up leading AI start-ups like Cohere and Elon Musk's xAI, and the company is now building 100 new data centers (on top of its existing 66) because it can't keep up with demand. Therefore, now could be a great time to buy Oracle stock ahead of what could be a growth surge in the coming years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n9. Microsoft: 504,247% return since IPO\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is nipping at Apple's heels for the title of world's most valuable company. It has a market cap of $2.7 trillion, so it isn't far away. However, Microsoft has delivered a much larger gain than Apple since its IPO in 1986 (it came public with a much smaller valuation). Microsoft stock has soared 504,247% to date, or by 25.9% compounded annually.\n\nMicrosoft still operates some of its flagship software products, like the Windows operating system and Word. But it also expanded into hardware (computers and devices), gaming, cloud computing, and AI. Last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in leading AI start-up OpenAI, which developed the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models into its Azure cloud platform, Bing search engine, 365 document suite, and Edge internet browser, among other products. It's allowing the company to successfully monetize AI already, with 18,000 businesses signed up to its Azure OpenAI Service cloud segment and tens of thousands of organizations using its AI Copilot tool for 365 in the early access program.\n\nThose AI integrations could drive the next leg of Microsoft's growth, and with its stock near an all-time high, investors certainly appear optimistic.\n\n10. Berkshire Hathaway: 3,787,464% return since IPO\n\nFinally, the stock on this list that has created the most value is Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). It's an investment company led by none other than Warren Buffett, who steered it to a 3,787,464% increase in value between 1965 (when he took the helm) and 2022.\n\nThat is a compound annual return of 19.8%, and while it's a lesser yearly gain than some other stocks I've mentioned, Berkshire's ability to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 on a consistent basis for 58 years shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nBerkshire owns a $358 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, with large positions in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. It also wholly owns private companies like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Its diverse exposure to so many different industries has been the secret sauce to its consistent returns over such a long period of time.\n\nIf you're looking for a stock with a solid track record of crushing the S&P 500, then look no further.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Down 40% from Highs, Is TTD Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "While the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index (NDX) surged over 40% in 2023, there are several tech stocks trading significantly below all-time highs. The rally in 2023 was primarily driven by large-cap companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Meanwhile, shares of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) are currently trading 40% below all-time highs, valuing the company at $33.6 billion.\n\nDespite the pullback in the last two years, TTD stock has returned over 2,280% to investors since its initial public offering in September 2016, but can the tech stock replicate these gains in the future?\n\nI am bullish on TTD stock, as the company is part of a rapidly expanding market, allowing it to grow revenue and profit margins at a comfortable pace in the upcoming decade, which should translate to outsized gains for shareholders. Let’s see why.\n\nAn Overview of The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk offers an enterprise-facing demand-side digital platform allowing companies to better optimize their online marketing campaigns. TTD’s portfolio of tools and solutions leverages the power of data, allowing customers to reach a wide range of audiences at a lower cost.\n\nA global technology company, TTD empowers the buyers of digital ads. Using its cloud-based platform, ad buyers can create, manage, and optimize data-driven digital ad campaigns across formats and channels, including video, connected TV (CTV), audio, display, and social.\n\nTTD’s platform boasts seamless integration with key inventory, publisher, and data partners, providing ad buyers with reach while improving decision-making capabilities. Its client base includes ad agencies, brands, and other ad-oriented service providers.\n\nTTD enters into master service agreements with its customers and generates revenue by charging them a platform fee based on total ad spend. Additionally, it drives sales through data services and other advanced platform functionalities.\n\nStory continues\n\nTTD: Positioned for Growth\n\nThe Trade Desk is well poised to benefit from the growing digitization of media and a fragmented audience base, which has increased the complexity of advertising in the past decade, leading to demand for an automated ad-buying process.\n\nTTD aims to increase enterprise demand by developing the programmatic capabilities of its platform and ad inventory. It believes the growth of the programmatic ad market is essential for top-line growth, while the widespread adoption of these services allows the company to acquire new clients and increase spending from existing ones.\n\nIn its quarterly filing, TTD explained, “Although our clients include some of the largest advertising agencies in the world, we believe there is significant room for us to expand further within these clients and gain a larger amount of their advertising spend through our platform.”\n\nA report from Market Research Future estimates the programmatic ad market to grow from $56.28 billion in 2022 to $138.25 billion in 2030, indicating an annual growth rate of 13.7% in this period.\n\nTTD ended 2022 with sales of $1.58 billion, suggesting it had a market share of 2.8%. If the company can raise its market share to 5% in the next few years, it might end 2030 with sales of almost $7 billion.\n\nThe Trade Desk expects the adoption of programmatic advertising by inventory owners and content providers to expand the volume and type of ad inventory for its clients. For example, it has expanded its CTV, native, and audio ad offerings via integrations with supply-side partners.\n\nThe gross spending on The Trade Desk has risen from $552 million in 2015 to $7.74 billion in 2022, allowing the company to increase sales from $114 million to $1.58 billion in this period.\n\nHow Did the Trade Desk Perform in Q3 2023?\n\nIn Q3 2023, The Trade Desk reported revenue of $493.3 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Programmatic ad platforms such as TTD continue to grow at an enviable pace as advertisers are ready to pay a premium for precision and transparency while maximizing returns from their campaigns.\n\nTTD ended Q3 with a customer retention rate of 95%, a rate it has maintained for the last nine years.\n\nWith an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) margin of 40%, TTD expanded its adjusted earnings by 27% year-over-year to $0.33 per share in Q3.\n\nIs TTD Stock Undervalued or Overvalued?\n\nAnalysts tracking TTD expect sales to rise by 21.9% to $1.92 billion for Fiscal 2023 and by 20.5% to $2.32 billion this year. Its adjusted earnings are forecast to rise from $1.04 per share in 2022 to $1.27 per share for Fiscal 2023 and $1.43 per share for Fiscal 2024.\n\nSo, priced at 54.3x forward earnings, TTD stock trades at a lofty valuation, especially since the sector’s multiple is much lower at 15.7x.\n\nIs TTD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOut of the 20 analysts covering TTD stock, 19 recommend a Buy, one recommends a Hold, and none recommend a Sell. The average TTD stock price target is $82.69, 20.8% above the current price.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe Trade Desk is a high-growth company that commands a premium valuation. Still, it’s part of an expanding addressable market, providing it with enough room to grow its revenue, earnings, and cash flows in 2024 and beyond. The secular shift towards CTV advertising in key markets should also act as a positive catalyst for TTD, making it a top investment choice right now.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Blue-Chip Bargains: 3 Stocks with 50% Upside in 2024",
        "content": "The general rule is that higher returns come with higher risk exposure. In equities, it would imply buying growth and penny stocks that have a relatively higher beta. However, there are time when low-beta blue-chip stocks can outperform growth stocks for a certain period. This can be due to industry or company specific catalysts. Further, there can be a case of blue-chip stock bargains where the valuation gap is deep. A potential reversal in sentiment can translate into robust returns in quick time.\n\nA good example of industry or company specific trigger is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. Backed by the growth in demand for artificial intelligence, the blue-chip stock has skyrocketed by 235% in 12 months. Similarly, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rallied from deeply oversold levels by 100% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe focus of this column is on blue-chip stock bargains that are likely to trend higher by 50% this year. Let’s talk about the business and financial metrics that back this bullish.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 6.3 after a correction of almost 40% in the last 12 months. The decline in ALB stock has been due to lower lithium prices.\n\nHowever, valuations indicate that the downside is overdone and I am bullish on a strong rally from current levels of $136. As a matter of fact, ALB stock touched lows of $112 in November 2023. The stock is already higher by 21% from the lows. I expect the positive momentum to sustain.\n\nThere are two important points to note in the downturn. These are also the factors to be bullish on ALB stock.\n\nFirst, Albemarle has strong fundamentals and with a leverage of 1.2 coupled with cash and equivalents of $1.6 billion, I don’t see any financial stress.\n\nFurther, Albemarle is preparing a strong base for stellar revenue growth once lithium reverses potentially in the second half of the year. Between 2022 and 2027, the company is targeting tripling of lithium conversion capacity. This will translate into robust growth and cash flows in the next few years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T logo on wooden background\n\nSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) has gradually trended higher by 13.5% in the last six months. I believe that the rally is likely to gain momentum in 2024 considering the valuations and business growth metrics. To put things into perspective, T stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 7.1. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 6.41%.\n\nFrom a business perspective, AT&T continues to invest in 5G and fiber for long-term growth. Business metrics have been positive with postpaid phone and fiber subscribers increasing on a sustained basis. AT&T is also looking to spin-off or sell its cybersecurity business. This will help in value unlocking and creating a leaner organization.\n\nIf we look at the financials, AT&T is a deleveraging story. The company has a BBB rating with the S&P with a stable outlook. For the first nine months of 2023, AT&T reported free cash flow of $10.4 billion. With business growth, I expect FCF to swell and this will support dividends and deleveraging.\n\nChevron Corporation (CVX) CVX stock\n\nSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the possibility of multiple rates cuts this year, I believe that oil is likely to trend higher. This will be good news for oil and gas stocks. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock has declined by 15% in the last 12 months and looks deeply overvalued. I am bullish on a strong rally for this 4% dividend yield stocks.\n\nIn October, Chevron announced an agreement to acquire Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) for a consideration of $53 billion. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to cash flow per share in 2025. Further, after the completion of the acquisition, Chevron expects annual capital expenditure of $19 to $22 billion. Big investments will translate into production growth and cash flow upside.\n\nIt’s worth noting that for Q3 2023, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $9.7 billion. With low break-even assets, OCF is likely to remain robust. This will ensure that aggressive investments are from internal cash flows and credit metrics remain strong.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.23, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.23 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 31 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.8% and 8.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in NVDA?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $12.31.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Building an investment portfolio from scratch can be difficult, especially if you're new to investing. It's easy to feel overwhelmed with so many different investment options out there, but focusing on stocks that are set to outperform the market over the next 12 months is an excellent place to start.\n\nLet's now take a look at one standout stock that could be a perfect fit for your portfolio.\n\nWhy You Should Pay Attention to Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\n\nOn May 20, 2019, NVDA was added to the Zacks Focus List at $39.13 per share. Shares have increased 1235.37% to $522.53 since then.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, 15 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $1.49 to $12.31. NVDA boasts an average earnings surprise of 19%.\n\nMoreover, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to grow 268.6% for the current fiscal year.\n\nBecause stock prices react to revisions, buying stocks with rising earnings estimates can be very profitable. Focus List stocks like NVDA offer investors a great opportunity to get into a company whose future earnings estimates will be raised, potentially leading to price momentum.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Joseph White\n\nDETROIT (Reuters) - Intel said on Tuesday it will launch automotive versions of its newest AI-enabled chips, taking on Qualcomm and Nvidia in the market for semiconductors that can power the brains of future cars.\n\nIntel also said it will acquire Silicon Mobility, a French startup that designs system-on-a-chip technology and software for controlling electric vehicle motors and onboard charging systems. Intel did not disclose a purchase price for the closely held company, controlled by venture funds Cipio Partners and Capital-E.\n\nChinese automaker Zeekr will be the first automaker to use Intel's AI system on a chip to create \"an enhanced living room experience\" in vehicles, including AI voice assistants and video conferencing, Intel's automotive business chief Jack Weast said ahead of the CES technology show in Las Vegas.\n\nIntel's new automotive system on a chip products will adapt the company's recently launched AI PC technology for the durability and performance requirements of vehicles, Weast said.\n\nIntel has supplied chips for infotainment systems installed in 50 million vehicles, but has been eclipsed by Nvidia and Qualcomm in the growing market for powerful semiconductors required by automated driving technology, upgradeable vehicle system software and complex dashboard displays.\n\n\"Intel has done a pretty terrible job communicating our success in automotive,\" Weast told reporters in a conference call ahead of the announcement at the CES technology show in Las Vegas. \"We are going to change that.\"\n\nIntel will try to separate itself from rivals by offering chips that automakers can use across their product lines, from lowest-priced to premium vehicles, Weast said.\n\n\"If AI in the car means 500 watts ... and God knows what costs ... it's not scalable,\" Weast said, referring to Nvidia's powerful, expensive products.\n\nNvidia last year formed an alliance with MediaTek of Taiwan to offer lower-cost chip sets. MediaTek is a leader in supplying technology for Android-based infotainment displays used in lower-priced vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's fast-growing electric vehicle market will be a battleground for chip makers. Chinese vehicle makers are racing to offer advanced infotainment systems and automated driving. Zeekr, for example, is a customer for both Intel and Nvidia's technology.\n\nIntel will also be \"agnostic\" as to what technology for automated driving or other functions automaker customers want to use, he said.\n\nIntel will not require automakers to use advanced driving chips designed by its former Mobileye unit, he said. Instead, automakers can have Intel incorporate their own chiplets to enable specific functions into the Intel system at a lower cost.\n\n(Reporting by Joe White; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

        "title": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 39.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 268.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -2.8%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.95, which means that the company gets $0.95 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.74, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 118.4% this year versus the industry average of 5.1%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Nvidia (NVDA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $522.75 in the previous session. Nvidia has gained 5.5% since the start of the year compared to the 51.5% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 156.9% return for the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 21, 2023, Nvidia reported EPS of $4.02 versus consensus estimate of $3.36 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 11.9%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $12.31 per share on $58.92 billion in revenues. This represents a 268.56% change in EPS on a 118.42% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $20.07 per share on $90.57 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 63.07% and 53.73%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nNvidia may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nNvidia has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 42.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 23.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 168X versus its peer group's average of 12.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.15. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Nvidia fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Nvidia shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "LI Stock Alert: Li Auto Announces New Nvidia Partnership",
        "content": "Another electric vehicle (EV) producer is getting ready to ride the artificial intelligence (AI) wave. Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has announced a new partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to help usher in the next phase of autonomous driving. DRIVE Thor, a new centralized car computer from Nvidia, will power the Chinese automaker’s next fleet of EVs. After a difficult past few quarters, Li could certainly use a positive catalyst to kickstart the new year. Thankfully, joining forces with one of the world’s leading AI companies is a great way for LI stock to begin a turnaround and make up the ground it lost in 2023.\n\nThis isn’t Li’s first time working with Nvidia. It has previously used the company’s Drive Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) in its vehicles, as have fellow Chinese EV producers Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV). But now, the AI leader is working on an even more advanced system that stands to help push us toward a driverless future.\n\nWhat’s Happening With LI Stock\n\nSo far, news of the Nvidia partnership hasn’t helped boost LI stock. As of this writing, shares are down 3% for the day and aren’t showing signs of an imminent rebound. However, that is due more to general market momentum than anything else. Many Chinese EV stocks are down today, including NIO and XPEV.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast week, LI stock dropped on news that the company would be delaying a key EV launch. Li Auto needs to turn things around in 2024 if it wants to show investors that it is still worth betting on. Thankfully, this development is likely to accomplish exactly that. Described as the “next-generation centralized car computer,” Drive THOR will include many essential functions into a single AI computing platform. Nvidia vice president of automotive Xinzhou Wu recently addressed this revolutionary new product, stating:\n\n“The transportation industry is embracing centralized compute for highly automated and autonomous driving. The AI car computer of choice for today’s intelligent fleets is NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, with automakers increasingly looking to the advanced capabilities and AI performance of its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, for their future vehicle roadmaps.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThis type of partnership comes at a time when LI stock is trading at low levels. Even after surging in late December 2023, it is still down more than 6% for the month. That could make for a tempting entry point for investors who don’t mind a little risk. Beaten-down EV stocks are due for a comeback as market conditions improve in 2024. Additionally, Li stands to benefit from the anticipation for its MEGA multi-purpose vehicle, scheduled for release in March.\n\nWhen Li introduces Nvidia’s new technology to its vehicles, sales are likely to surge as consumers take advantage of these AI advances. All these factors put LI stock in an excellent position to keep rising in the coming year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O’Brient did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nSamuel O’Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

        "content": "Despite a downturn to begin 2024, certain stocks continue to stand out. While they might be divided on the overall direction of the market, analysts remain bullish on many individual stocks. They share common attributes. That includes solid earnings, strong competitive advantages, and catalysts that are expected to drive their share prices higher.\n\nInvestors looking for safe places to park their money in the current market should pay close attention to the ratings and outlooks that analysts have on some stocks. This is especially true when the consensus outlook for a particular stock is very strong. As we continue to navigate a rocky start for the market, let’s explore some of 2024’s investment darlings: three stocks analysts can’t stop talking about.\n\nLululemon (LULU) the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wall\n\nSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts are singing the praises of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU). The athletic apparel maker raised its fourth quarter sales and profit forecasts on strong holiday sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn early December, Lululemon had forecast soft holiday sales amid concerns about weak consumer spending. But now, LULU is pleased with last month’s sales. In fact, consumer spending proved to be more resilient than anticipated.\n\nThe company said that it now expects Q4 revenue of $3.170 billion to $3.190 billion. That compares with a previous forecast of $3.135 billion to $3.170 billion in sales. In terms of profit, Lululemon now anticipates earnings per share (EPS) of $4.96 to $5. The prior forecast was $4.85 to $4.93. Previously, the company announced Q3 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts across the board. LULU stock has gained 64% over the last 12 months and is up 269% over the past five years.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) Closeup of the BlackRock (BLK) sign seen at the entrance to the American global investment management corporation BlackRock, Inc.'s office in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is the world’s largest asset manager with more than $9 trillion of assets under management. And, it’s expected to be a big beneficiary of spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) should they be approved by the the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, BlackRock has set the fee for its proposed Bitcoin ETF at 0.30%. This stands among the lowest of more than a dozen competitors that have also applied to the SEC to launch BTC ETFs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock’s fee is lower than the fees of 0.80% and 0.39% set by competitors Valkyrie Investments and Fidelity, among others. The proposed fees come as BlackRock and the other asset managers await a Jan. 10 SEC decision of approving spot Bitcoin ETFs. Indeed, this would be a first for the American marketplace. If approved, the ETFs are expected to attract billions of dollars in new capital. Thus, analysts see BlackRock as a big winner in the space.\n\nBLK stock has gained only 5% in the last year but has doubled over the past five years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts continue to be bullish on chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). After all, it was a top-performing stock in 2023, rising more than 200% during the year.\n\nIn recent months, new U.S. export controls imposed on the sale of microchips and semiconductors to China raised concerns for NVDA. Specifically, Nvidia derives about a quarter of its annual revenue from China. However, the company is addressing those concerns, producing a new AI chip exclusively for the Chinese market.\n\nCalled the “H20,” the new chip is the most powerful of three China-focused microchips Nvidia has developed to meet new U.S. export rules that were introduced last autumn. Production of the H20 is scheduled to begin in this year’s second quarter. The chip includes most of Nvidia’s features for AI work but with reduced computing power to comply with U.S. government rules. NVDA executives have said that the new AI chip should help to preserve its dominant market share in China.\n\nNVDA stock has increased 1,275% in the last five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "title": "Abercrombie &amp; Fitch outperformed AI darling Nvidia in 2023—its CEO credits COVID lessons for stock market surge",
        "content": "Blazers and slacks outshone chipmakers in 2023 despite the furore around AI—and the CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch says targeting young millennials was the golden ticket.\n\nOhio-based Abercrombie & Fitch exploded onto the market in the 1990s with its all-American college sports aesthetic.\n\nBut with a boom in online retail and with fast fashion flooding the market, Abercrombie has found itself in more recent years struggling to cut through the noise.\n\nOn top of that customers were also turning their backs on a company that was engulfed in race, religion, sex discrimination and harassment lawsuits.\n\nSo when CEO Fran Horowitz joined in 2017 she had her work cut out to rebuild the brand from the \"ground up\"—but it seems to have worked.\n\nIn the past year, the company's share price has jumped more than 245%, buoyed by strong profit reporting and guidance.\n\nThat means the once infamous jeans maker is now outperforming the likes of Nvidia—which although has a higher share price of $522.53 vs Abercrombie's $95.27—has seen its share price rise 234% over the past year.\n\nEarlier this week Abercrombie further thrilled investors by raising its Q4 2023 outlook after a stronger-than-anticipated holiday trading, with net sales expected to rise into the high teens percentage range, compared with its previous estimations of lower double-digit figures.\n\nHorowitz said rebuilding the company at every level had been necessary to bring in such results, telling CNBC: \"[The outlook is] the result of a lot of hard work over the past few years, focussing on rebuilding our brands, investments into our technology, [and] rebuilding the company foundationally from top to bottom.\"\n\nHorowitz said Abercrombie learned during COVID to operate lean.\n\nIn its Q3 earnings reported in November, the brand said \"tightly controlled\" inventories had contributed to a gross profit rate expansion of 570 basis points.\n\nThe company's adjoining data revealed an inventory of $595 million, a decrease of 20% compared to the same quarter a year prior. This has led to lower write-downs of inventories.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Chasing that last sale is the biggest learning that we had coming out of COVID,\" Horowitz said. \"You can do a lot more with a lot less and I think it took a year like that and a really strong lesson to understand how you can manage your business very differently. That's truly what's helping drive the terrific results that we're seeing this year.\"\n\nShaking away the past\n\nA complete overhaul was necessary for the brand to fully distance itself from allegations of the past.\n\nIn 2023 Abercrombie's former CEO Mike Jeffries, who left in 2014, was accused of sexually abusing young men and allegedly ran a sprawling sex ring. A spokesperson for Jeffries told CNBC the matter will be addressed in court.\n\nAbercrombie has been hit with a lawsuit for alleging turning a blind eye to these actions at the time.\n\nA spokesperson for Abercrombie & Fitch said in an emailed statement that the company was “appalled and disgusted” by the alleged behavior, which had been brought to light by a BBC investigation.\n\nTaking advantage of a 'big white space'\n\nIt's not often brands forget to cater to young Millennials, but specifically shifting its focus to this demographic is what brought the wins for Abercrombie & Fitch.\n\nWhen questioned about which brands the company was taking market share from, Horowitz insisted she was merely filling in a blank. \"[With] Abercrombie particularly there was just a big white space for us, and we aged up the consumer and went to this young Millennial consumer,\" Horowitz said.\n\n\"There really wasn't a lot of competition in that space and so we seized the opportunity,\" she added.\n\nTargeting age-specific consumers has also given Abercrombie a pipeline: pushing their teen buyers at Hollister up to Abercrombie as they age.\n\n\"[Hollister] was a lot of work heading into back to school this year, and we're happy to see the inflection and we've seen it across now Q3 and Q4,\" Horowitz said.\n\nWith questions still looming over how robust the consumer is and how long it will take inflation to come down, retailers are keeping a close eye on economic data and the likelihood of a recession.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR is reportedly in advanced discussions for a potential acquisition by Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE. Sources, per a Wall Street Journal report, indicate that the estimated value of this agreement could reach approximately $13 billion. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the deal could be announced as soon as this week. However, as of now, neither party has issued any official comments on this issue.\r\n\r\nJuniper offers an extensive array of routing, switching and network security solutions. The company specializes in developing products that facilitate building network infrastructure used for services and applications based on a single Internet protocol network worldwide. Juniper also boasts a solid AI portfolio. Juniper AIOps (AI for IT Operations) leverage machine learning capabilities in conjunction with data science to streamline enterprise operations across wireless access, wired access and security domains.\r\n\r\nHPE stands as a key player in the server and hardware storage sectors and a prominent cloud service provider. The company is actively seeking to diversify its revenue sources and views artificial intelligence as the next major market. Hewlett Packard is strategically focusing on expanding its generative AI offerings to tap the growing opportunities in this domain. The prospective takeover of Juniper will be a significant stride in that direction.\r\n\r\nJuniper faces severe competition in each of its served markets, especially from industry leader Cisco. Juniper and Cisco collectively hold a substantial share of the core router market. However, Juniper’s market share can tumble as competition creeps up.\r\n\r\nIntegration of Juniper’s AI and cloud portfolio will serve as a valuable enhancement to HPE’s portfolio. Moreover, the move not only aligns with its goal to diversify revenue streams but will also strengthen HPE’s competitive edge within the industry.\r\n\r\nJuniper is benefiting from strong sales in the Enterprise vertical and AI-driven Enterprise solutions.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Coming: 2 Stock Split Stocks That Could Help Make You Rich in 2024",
        "content": "If you want to buy stocks in the new year, historical patterns are on your side. Since its founding in 1971, the Nasdaq Composite has risen an average of 19% in each year following a rebound year like the one we experienced in 2023. And with the Federal Reserve expected to lower interest rates and begin easing its monetary policy, there is no reason to think 2024 will be any exception to this long-running pattern.\n\nOne way for investors to bet on a new bull market is with stock split stocks -- shares in companies that have recently divided their shares into more units to make them more available for retail investors. While splits don't change business fundamentals, they can boost liquidity and signal that these companies are moving in the right direction.\n\nLet's explore why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) fit the bill.\n\nNvidia\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is no stranger to explosive growth; often its stock price is out of reach for smaller investors who don't have access to fractional shares. To manage the challenge, the company has split its stock five times since 2000, including a 4-for-1 conversion in 2021. The good news is that Nvidia's bull run looks far from over -- especially as it benefits from rising interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDespite surging 244% over the last 12 months, Nvidia stock still appears to have plenty of steam left. According to analysts at Bloomberg, the generative AI industry could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% to $1.3 trillion by 2032 as the technology is refined and adapted to more use cases. Nvidia stands to benefit because of its 80% market share in the advanced chips that make training these applications possible.\n\nWhile competition is growing from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices, the opportunity looks big enough for multiple companies to share the action. Further, Nvidia's early lead has given it a competitive moat because more programmers are familiar with its hardware and have built software and servers specially designed for their use.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite seeing its net income rise over 12-fold to $9.2 billion, Nvidia's shares remain reasonably valued at just under 25 times forward earnings. This is below the Nasdaq-100 average of 28, suggesting it isn't too late for investors to bet on Nvidia's long-term potential.\n\nTesla\n\nLike Nvidia, Tesla is another rapidly growing company that has relied on stock splits to manage its expanding share price. Most recently, this included a 3-for-1 split in 2022. Like many automakers, Tesla faces macroeconomic challenges from high interest rates and competition. But its strategy to become a mass-market automaker remains on track.\n\nIn the near term, the EV industry is under a lot of pressure. With interest rates high, and recent inflation putting pressure on consumer wallets, people are putting off new car purchases -- forcing automakers like Tesla to lower prices to maintain their market share. With that said, the company is also using the opportunity to accelerate its mass-market strategy.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCEO Elon Musk claims to be developing a $25,000 car called the Model 2 expected to be unveiled this year. And Reuters reports that the company is also working on a 25,000 Euro ($26,838) vehicle at its factory in Berlin. Lower-cost options could help Tesla make up for lower margins with higher volumes, while vertical integration efforts like lithium refining could help this strategy by bringing down production costs.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 68, Tesla stock is expensive, considering the near-term challenges it faces. But the company is no stranger to being a high-priced stock. And it has historically proven the naysayers wrong by growing into its valuation.\n\nFocus on fundamentals\n\nWhile historical patterns and stock splits can make investors more comfortable in the market, they take a back seat to fundamentals over the long term. Nvidia and Tesla are great buys because of their dominant position in their industries and the potential to ride the wave of transformational technologies.\n\nBut for me, Nvidia looks like the better bet right now because of its faster bottom-line growth rate and relatively low valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency, surged past the $47,000 mark on Jan 8 before settling just above $46,825. Cryptocurrencies rallied in 2023 and gathered further pace in late October, which has continued into this year.\n\nThe last time Bitcoin traded above $47,000 was in April 2022. Although Bitcoin price remains below its all-time high of $67,000 reached in November 2021, market participants are once again bullish about its potential that is driving the rally.\n\nThe recent rally is primarily being driven by renewed optimism that the SEC will soon approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe SEC is nearing its initial deadline to either approve or reject an ETF application, specifically that of Ark 21Shares, which is due on Jan 10. There is widespread expectation that the SEC will choose to approve multiple applications simultaneously to ensure a balanced playing field.\n\nSuch a decision would mark a major milestone for the overall cryptocurrency landscape, which, despite its anti-establishment origins, has proven the value of Bitcoin and Ether to a considerable extent within the institutional investing sphere.\n\nAlso, major players like Invesco, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree and BlackRock, Inc. BLK are actively seeking approval to launch a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe expected approval is poised to exert a notable positive influence, offering robust backing to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvestors now expect a green light for a spot Bitcoin ETF from the SEC as early as the first half of this year.\n\nBesides, easing inflation has also raised optimism that the Federal Reserve might conclude its current monetary tightening efforts and initiate rate cuts this year, possibly as early as March. Elevated interest rates typically have negative impacts on growth-oriented sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nBlackRock, Inc. is one of the world’s largest investment managers and is publicly owned. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race back in June 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days. BlackRock presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 14.4% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. COIN offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment.\n\nCoinbase Global’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 92%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nVisa Inc. V is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain. This expansion of V includes collaboration with prominent merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, marking a pivotal development in the world of digital payments.\n\nVisa Inc.’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 12.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 60 days. V currently has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

HPQ and Dell Technologies DELL, have been witnessing declining demand due to the reopening of economies, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates and fears of a possible recession.\n\nHowever, they are optimistic about the PC market recovery in 2024, with AI PCs to be a key growth driver. Therefore, both the American PC manufacturers — HP and Dell — are planning to roll out AI PCs to grab the growing opportunities in this category.\n\nPC market recovery expectations of HP and Dell coincide with the independent research firm Gartner Inc.’s IT views. During its preliminary data release for third-quarter 2023 global PC shipments, Gartner pointed out that the worst could be over for vendors by the end of 2023, and PC market recovery can be seen in 2024 due to increased demand driven by the PC refreshment cycle.\n\nWith AI becoming increasingly pervasive across various applications, the quest for more powerful hardware to support these capabilities has intensified. NVIDIA's chips are tailored to cater to this growing demand, promising transformative AI experiences for users.\n\nThe recently introduced RTX 40 SUPER series chips, engineered with specialized AI Tensor Cores, present a monumental leap in AI capabilities for PCs. This transformative technology isn't limited to gaming. It extends across diverse sectors, facilitating faster deep learning inference, generative AI applications and seamless productivity tools like Adobe Photoshop, among others.\n\nMoreover, these chips pave the way for NVIDIA to tap the expansive market of generative AI apps expected to flood PCs. Its TensorRT software and TensorRT-LLM library offer optimized inference performance and accelerate processing speeds for large language models, amplifying the utility and potential of AI-enabled PCs.\n\nAs the industry increasingly embraces AI-centric computing, NVIDIA's forward-thinking approach and commitment to cutting-edge AI chips position the company as a key player poised to capitalize on the emerging opportunities in the AI-enabled PC landscape. With its newly introduced AI chips, NVIDIA is primed to revolutionize PC experiences, catering to the surging demand for high-performance AI-integrated computing solutions.\n\nCurrently, NVIDIA and Gartner each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while HP and Dell each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The less obvious benefit is that a stock split tells investors the underlying company is doing something right.\n\nTo elaborate, stock splits follow tremendous share price appreciation, which rarely happens without solid financial results and some competitive advantage. Consider these recent stock splits. All nine companies satisfy those conditions.\n\nAmazon: 20-for-1 split in June 2022 Apple: 4-for-1 split in August 2020 Alphabet: 20-for-1 split in July 2022 Celsius Holdings: 3-for-1 split in November 2023 Dexcom: 4-for-1 split in June 2022 Monster Beverage: 2-for-1 split in March 2023 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 split July 2021 Palo Alto Networks: 3-for-1 split in September 2022 Tesla: 3-for-1 split in August 2022\n\nThese nine companies have something else in common: They are all components of the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), an index widely seen as a benchmark for growth stocks. That is relevant because history says now is a good time to put money into Nasdaq stocks.\n\nHistory says the Nasdaq Composite will rocket higher in 2024\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite nosedived 33% in 2022, dragged down by fierce inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes, and recession fears. But there was a silver lining in that catastrophic decline. Prior to 2022, the Nasdaq had only notched a calendar-year loss of 10% or more eight times since its inception in 1971. But following those double-digit declines, the index rebounded by a median of 52% over the next two years.\n\nFor context, the Nasdaq has gained about 40% since the end of 2022, by that record leaving implied upside of 12% through the end of 2024. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns. The Nasdaq crashed in 2022 due to headwinds created by a global pandemic for which there is no historical precedent, so its continued recovery in 2024 may not fit historical patterns.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, the Nasdaq returned about 10.3% annually over the last two decades. In that context, patient investors still have good reason to put money into Nasdaq stocks today.\n\nThis brings me back to the stock splits listed. Wall Street is particularly bullish on Nvidia. The chipmaker has a median 12-month price target of $650 per share, which implies 33% upside from its current price.\n\nNvidia is growing at a phenomenal pace\n\nNvidia reported incredible financial results in the third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), crushing expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion on record data center sales, driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. The company also delivered strong performances in its gaming and professional visualization segments.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia said third-quarter non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income rocketed 593% to $4.02 per diluted share. The impetus behind that improved profitability was a 19-percentage-point increase in non-GAAP gross profit margin. Management attributed that margin expansion to an improved data center product mix, suggesting that high-margin software and services accounted for more of total sales.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the company expects revenue to reach $20 billion, implying a sequential acceleration to 230% revenue growth. Management also expects adjusted operating expenses to increase just 24%, implying that non-GAAP net income will once again grow much faster than revenue.\n\nAs a caveat, Nvidia cannot sustain triple-digit growth indefinitely. Investors should expect that trajectory to moderate at some point, but the stock is still a worthwhile investment, given that Nvidia is the gold standard in AI computing. The company holds 80% to 95% market share in machine learning (ML) chips with its graphics processing units (GPUs), and it consistently delivers top results at the MLPerf benchmarks, the industry standard in evaluating the performance of AI hardware, software, and services.\n\nNvidia has strategically expanded its data center portfolio\n\nNvidia has bolstered its data center portfolio in recent years by expanding into high-performance networking products, central processing units (CPUs), and subscription software and cloud services. That new strategy makes Nvidia even more important to the data center value chain, and it enhances its ability to monetize AI.\n\nFor instance, the Nvidia InfiniBand networking platform provides the throughput data centers require to support AI workloads. CEO Jensen Huang says most large-scale AI factories are standardizing on InfiniBand.\n\nSimilarly, DGX Cloud is a service that provides on-demand access to supercomputing infrastructure and Nvidia AI Enterprise software, democratizing access to AI development tools. In short, DGX Cloud lets businesses build and deploy AI applications across a range of disciplines without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on AI infrastructure.\n\nFinally, Nvidia has expanded its semiconductor product portfolio by entering the CPU market. That means its compute platform can now support data center AI workloads at the networking level, the CPU level, and the software and services level, in addition to the GPU level. Huang says the three new elements of the company's growth strategy are hitting their stride, hinting at sustained momentum in the coming years.\n\nNvidia stock trades at a reasonable price\n\nToday, Nvidia values its addressable market at $1 trillion, but that figure will continue to climb higher as more enterprises incorporate AI and ML into their products and services. Indeed, the AI market is forecast to grow at 37% annually through 2030. In that context, investors can expect Nvidia to achieve annual revenue growth in the mid-20% range for years to come.\n\nMoreover, analysts at Morningstar expect the company to grow revenue at 22% annually over the next decade. That forecast implies total sales growth of 630% over the next 10 years, which makes its current valuation of 27.3 times sales look reasonable, even though it is a premium to the three-year average of 23.5 times sales.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Nvidia shareholders will see a positive return in the next 12 months, nor is the Nasdaq Composite guaranteed to gain value in 2024. But patient investors willing to hold Nvidia stock for at least five years should feel comfortable buying a small position today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia is working on its approach to China, the world’s second-largest economy, as it tries to comply with Biden’s chip export controls",
        "content": "Nvidia has a China problem. Chinese companies are some of Nvidia's biggest clients, with the country traditionally contributing about 20% of the company's revenue. Yet the Biden administration is worried that the company's chips, key to the AI revolution, are a national security risk if sent to China. That's giving the world's most valuable chip company a dilemma: How to stay involved in the world's second largest economy while still complying with Washington's rules.\n\nOn Monday, Nvidia announced that four car manufacturers—Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR and Xiaomi—will use the company's DRIVE technology to power their automated driving systems.\n\nWhile known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are now key to AI-related applications, Nvidia is also trying to get a foothold in the auto industry. The company has announced car-focused partnerships with both chip designer MediaTek and electronics manufacturer Foxconn. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even joined Foxconn's \"Tech Day\" to announce the chipmaker would be a key partner in the Apple supplier's efforts to start making electric cars.\n\nComplying with U.S. rules\n\nNvidia is also planning to start mass production of a new set of semiconductors designed for the China market which comply with updated U.S. export restrictions, reports Reuters. The company reportedly plans to start production later this year.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThis isn't the first time Nvidia has had to change its products to comply with U.S. rules. After the U.S. announced its first controls on semiconductor sales to China in October 2022, Nvidia developed chips for the Chinese market that offered similar capabilities to its high-end chips while still complying with U.S. rules.\n\nLast October, the Biden administration updated its export restrictions to close this loophole, forcing Nvidia to redevelop its products again. The updated rules even prevented Nvidia from selling its most advanced video gaming chips to Chinese firms. The chipmaker released a U.S.-compliant replacement in December, which it said was developed after the company \"extensively engaged with the U.S. government.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has, at times, warned against U.S. rules against chip sales to China. He previously warned, in an interview with the Financial Times in May, that U.S. export controls aimed at slowing China's advance in the semiconductor industry would instead encourage the country to build its own chips in a bid to rival Nvidia's. Then in another interview with CNBC in November, Huang said U.S. chipmakers were at least a decade away from \"supply chain independence\" from China.\n\nNvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress has downplayed the near-term effect of U.S. export restrictions, yet warned that, in the long-term, U.S. restrictions would lead to a “permanent loss of opportunities for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets.\"\n\nLast quarter, the company warned that data center revenue from countries affected by U.S. controls, including China, will \"decline significantly.\"\n\nCustomer demand\n\nYet Nvidia has a new problem: Chinese companies which originally flocked to its high-powered chips aren't as interested in weaker replacements.\n\nLocal Chinese chipmakers are pitching their own chips as a safer alternative, banking on fears among China's tech companies that the U.S. will once again tighten restrictions, according to Reuters in December.\n\nCompanies are also concerned that Nvidia's downgraded processors may mean there's not as much difference in performance compared to those produced by Chinese manufacturers, the Wall Street Journal reports. Firms like Alibaba and Tencent are now shifting some orders to Chinese companies like Huawei; the Chinese tech company has a new AI chip that Reuters describes as comparable to Nvidia's offerings.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Alphabet",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry exploded last year, with excitement over the technology unlikely to dissipate in 2024. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least the end of the decade, which would see it surpass a value of $1 trillion.\n\nThere's no better time to consider investing in the booming sector and potentially profiting from its long-term growth. Two of the most attractive options are Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). These companies are developing the hardware and software fueling the AI market's growth, and could deliver stellar gains over the next decade.\n\nLet's take a closer look at these companies and determine whether Nvidia or Alphabet is currently the better AI stock.\n\nNvidia\n\nWhether you've been following the boom in AI closely or have just glimpsed the occasional headline, chances are you know about Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last year. Since last January the company's shares soared 245% as its chips became the preferred hardware for AI developers worldwide.\n\nGraphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's are crucial to training and running AI models. As a result, demand for the chips skyrocketed in 2023 as countless companies pivoted their businesses to developing the segment. Nvidia's years of dominance in the GPU market allowed it to get a head start in AI, while rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have yet to catch up.\n\nAlongside a rising stock price, Nvidia's success in AI has seen its earnings reach new heights. In the third quarter of 2024 (which ended October 2023), the tech giant's revenue increased by 206% year over year as operating income climbed 1,600%. The growth was mainly thanks to a 279% rise in data centers, which profited from a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nNvidia will need to contend with increased chip competition in the coming months. However, the market's growth potential suggests there will be room for the company to retain its dominance and welcome newcomers, making this stock an attractive way to invest in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhile Nvidia is excelling in hardware, Alphabet has significant potential on the software side of AI. The company ramped up its expansion in the industry last year, launching its own version of OpenAI's ChatGPT in February called Bard, adding new AI tools on Google Cloud, and unveiling a highly anticipated AI model named Gemini in December.\n\nPopular brands like Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google have seen Alphabet attract a massive user base. In fact, the company is home to at least nine products with more than 1 billion users. Alphabet has used the popularity of its services to build a lucrative digital advertising business, with the company responsible for about 25% of the $740 billion market.\n\nHowever, the tech giant's substantial user base also strengthens its prospects in AI. An advanced AI model like Gemini could allow Alphabet to offer more efficient advertising, create a responsive search experience, and better analyze viewing trends on YouTube to improve video recommendations.\n\nAlphabet hit nearly $77 billion in free cash flow last year, more than cloud competitors Microsoft or Amazon. As a result, the company has the financial resources to continue investing in AI and flourish over the long term.\n\nIs Nvidia or Alphabet the better AI stock?\n\nNvidia and Alphabet will likely enjoy major gains from AI, with both looking like attractive stocks to hold for several years. However, EPS estimates suggest Nvidia might have more growth potential in the short term. GOOGL EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThese charts show how Alphabet's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share, while Nvidia's might achieve $24 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying those figures by each company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (Alphabet's 21 and Nvidia's 40) yields a stock price of $168 for Alphabet and $960 for Nvidia.\n\nLooking at their current positions, the projections would see Alphabet's stock rise about 24% and Nvidia's 96% in two years. As a result, despite its meteoric rise last year, Nvidia still has much to offer new investors, and is likely the better AI stock right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Futures tick lower, scrutiny on Boeing intensifies - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures pointed lower on Tuesday, suggesting a possible retreat from gains in the prior session that stemmed in part from a rally in shares in chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Elsewhere, two airlines reportedly discover loose parts on some of their grounded models of Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 737 Max 9 jet, adding to scrutiny on the planemaker that has been building since a dangerous mid-flight blowout on a single version of the aircraft last week.\n\n1. Futures edge lower\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped into the red on Tuesday, pointing a negative start to the trading day following a surge on Wall Street to begin the week.\n\nBy 04:59 ET (09:59 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 112 points or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures had lost 13 points or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dropped by 63 points or 0.4%.\n\nThe main averages jumped in the prior session, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite in particular climbing to its best day since mid-November. Helping drive the gains was strength in chip designer and artificial intelligence darling Nvidia, which surged by 6.4% (see below).\n\nEven a slump in Boeing shares following a fresh incident involving the planemaker's 737 Max jet was not enough to derail a 0.6% increase in the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average. The benchmark S&P 500 added 1.4% for the day.\n\nTraders are keeping an eye as well on key U.S. inflation due later in the week that could impact how Federal Reserve policymakers approach potential interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\n2. Nvidia touches new record high\n\nShares in Nvidia closed at a fresh record high of $522.53 on Monday, in a sign of investor excitement over the unveiling of new desktop graphics processors from the chipmaking giant.\n\nNvidia announced its new GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series of graphics processors ahead of a closely-watched consumer electronics conference in Las Vegas. In a statement, the U.S.-based group said the chips, along with a string of other products, will \"supercharge gaming and creating.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company, chiefly known as a designer of computer chips that power artificial intelligence, has become a by-word for recently soaring enthusiasm over the nascent technology. The hype fueled a more than tripling in the shares last year that has pushed its market value up to almost $1.3 trillion.\n\nNvidia's stock was the most traded on Wall Street in yesterday's session, with traders exchanging over $32 billion worth of shares, Reuters reported, citing LSEG data.\n\n3. Samsung estimates operating profit slide\n\nSamsung Electronics (KS:005930) said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter operating profit likely fell by about 35%, as a sluggish recovery in demand for the firm’s key memory and smartphone chips hit revenue.\n\nSamsung’s operating profit in the three months to Dec. 31 likely fell to 2.8 trillion won ($2.1 billion) from 3.7 trillion won a year ago. The firm has not reported an income increase on a year-on-year basis since the second quarter of 2022. Revenue also decreased to 67.40 trillion won from 70.46 trillion won a year ago, and missed Investing.com estimates of 70.1 trillion won.\n\nThe figures seemed to indicate that Samsung is still grappling with a slowdown in chip demand over the past two years. Rising interest rates and high inflation have persuaded many consumers to drastically scale back discretionary spending, denting demand for pricier items like electronics and creating a glut of supply.\n\nBut analysts are expecting a turnaround in the sector to materalize this year thanks to growing demand for high-tech AI chips. \"Supply and demand dynamics are a tailwind now,\" analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.\n\nSeoul-listed shares in the South Korean conglomerate, which will release a full earnings report on Jan. 31, dipped by 2.4%.\n\n4. Boeing's latest 737 Max crisis deepens\n\nLoose parts on some grounded models of Boeing's 737 Max 9 jet have reportedly been discovered by United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, as the crisis around the planemaker deepens following last week's dangerous mid-air fuselage blowout.\n\nAccording to a United statement quoted by industry publication The Air Current, preliminary inspections into its 737 Max 9s found that the aircraft had \"instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door plug.\" These problems included bolts on several panels that \"needed additional tightening,\" the carrier noted.\n\nAlaska Airlines also said on Monday that initial reports from its technicians found some \"loose hardware\" on some of its 737 Max 9s.\n\nConcerns over the Max 9 -- a version of Boeing's single-aisle plane that has about 10 more seats than the popular Max 8 -- have been heightened since a panel on an Alaska Airlines-operated flight blew out en route from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California last Friday. The pilots were able to turn the jet around and land it safely.\n\n5. Crude inches higher\n\nOil prices edged up on Tuesday, rebounding from sharp lossees in the previous session, as traders digested concerns over sluggish demand as well as Middle East tensions.\n\nBy 04:59 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% higher at $72.04 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 1.8% to $77.47 per barrel.\n\nBoth crude benchmarks had fallen over 3% on Monday as sharp price cuts by top exporter Saudi Arabia had raised worries about slowing crude demand, particularly from major Asian consumers.\n\nHowever, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, and fears that this could evolve into a regional crisis that may disrupt Middle Eastern oil supplies, remains an underlying support for the crude market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures tick lower, scrutiny on Boeing intensifies - what's moving markets\n\nGabriel Attal becomes France's youngest PM as Macron seeks reset\n\nMJ Gleeson faces sales decline and margin pressure amid market headwinds",

In this constantly changing environment, the best way to uncover value is by realizing each competitor’s specific advantages and possibilities. With this in mind, let’s examine three high-quality plays in the robotics field.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStryker Corp. (SYK) The Stryker (SYK) office in Fremont, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is a medical technology giant, known for its advances in robotics and continuing to make improvements and accomplishments in the industry. It has proven a solid market player in the past five years churning out an impressive 85% return.\n\nFurthermore, the third quarter of this year SYK reported a significant increase in revenue to $4.91 billion, as opposed to 83% from previous quarters. However, it also disclosed a 15% loss in net income of $692 million.

The company globally sold 4.22 million units, marking an increase of approximately 6.9% from the previous year.\n\nDespite global economic challenges, this upward trend underscores Hyundai’s solid market presence. Moreover, in the US, Hyundai set an all-time record in 2023 with sales soaring above 801,000, contributing to over one million vehicles sold – a significant rise from the previous year’s figures.\n\nAlso, HYMTF India sales increase is commendable with 9% growth of total sales. Hyundai Motor India Ltd. sold the highest in domestic sales recorded by any firm. Such milestones in critical markets reveal Hyundai’s growing global presence. Also, HYMTF thrives by forming alliances, such as the one with Kia who increases its sales.

The one-year return for this quality play is 96%.\n\nSeptember 2023 saw this dynamo smashing expectations, with its EPS surging past forecasts by 5%. Clocking in an EPS of $3.64, Rockwell left the predicted $3.47 in the dust, showcasing its robust financial muscle.\n\nFor fiscal growth, not only is Rockwell Automation expanding, but also its revenues are up an astounding 26%. This extraordinary growth highlights the company’s growing influence in industrial automation and demonstrates its ability to navigate and overcome the tide of competition successfully.\n\nDiving into partnerships and tech advancements, Rockwell Automation is playing a masterstroke.

These strategic moves catapult Rockwell into the forefront of cutting-edge simulations, essential for robotic operations. This proves that Rockwell is not just keeping up but setting the pace.\n\nIn summary, Rockwell Automation is changing the rules in the robotics and automation industry—it’s not just playing the game. This firm isn’t only a wise choice for investors thanks to its astounding success and innovative methods. It’s a shining example in the robotics stock market, influencing industrial automation’s very future.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Markets Party Like It's 2023!",
        "content": "Market activity was so healthy today, you’d think it was still 2023! After taking the air out of valuations across the board over the past week of trading, market participants saw fit to run a bit higher ahead of Q4 earnings season, which unofficially gets underway later this week. The Dow gained +216 points on the day, +0.58%, while the S&P 500 grew +66 points, +1.41%. The Nasdaq, boosted by a new graphics chips announcement from NVIDIA NVDA, beat the field, +319 points, +2.20%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose +1.94%.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares closed at session highs today, +6.4%, following an unveiling of three new AI-focused chips for desktop graphics, in what’s being called an “AI for Home” offering. The leader of last year’s Magnificent Seven stocks now trades at new all-time highs. In fact, all AI-related semiconductor stocks were up today after softening during trading last week. For NVIDIA, these new chips won’t post a meaningful new revenue stream as compared to, say, Data Center sales, which now comprise roughly 80% on NVIDIA’s business.\r\n\r\nAs far as the run-up ahead of Q4 earnings, there may be some question how much higher the market wants to push overall multiples. NVIDIA’s growth is all well and good — and makes sense, even at these high P/E levels — but JPMorgan JPM, which reports ahead of the bell Friday morning, is already trading +25% since this time last year. This is not to say it, as well as the other big banks reporting that day, won’t be meeting or beating estimates — they very well may. But a lot of the good news for giant banks like these already look somewhat priced in for the quarter about to report.\r\n\r\nFed members will be making spot appearances throughout the week, as will additional inflation prints like CPI and PPI for December. None of this is expect to make a dent in the Fed’s dot-plot blueprint of a hold at interest rates in the 5.25-5.50% range a few weeks from now. There is always a chance we could see a surprise move up or down on any of the more important economic metrics, but unless they gather consensus among other data points, we don’t expect to see the Fed move quickly on cutting rates.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Asian stocks rise as tech surges on AI hype; Inflation remains in focus",
        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday as regional technology shares surged amid renewed optimism over artificial intelligence, while focus remained on a slew of upcoming inflation reports for more cues on interest rate cuts this year.\n\nRegional markets recovered from a rough start to 2024, having mostly fallen for the past five sessions as markets second-guessed expectations for early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nU.S. inflation data due later this week is expected to provide more cues on the matter.\n\nRegional inflation readings offered some positive cues. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index surged 1.4% after a long weekend, as data showed inflation in Tokyo- which acts as a bellwether for the country- fell as expected in December, and was now within spitting distance of the Bank of Japan’s annual 2% target.\n\nWhile a devastating earthquake in central Japan somewhat dented sentiment towards the country, it also sparked some bets that the BOJ will have to delay plans to end its ultra-dovish policies in the face of rebuilding efforts after the disaster.\n\nAsian tech stocks surge amid resurgent AI hype, bargain buying\n\nGains in heavyweight technology stocks also boosted the Nikkei, particularly those with exposure to artificial intelligence. Chip testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857) surged nearly 7% and was among the top performers on the Nikkei.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index shot up 1% on strength in technology stocks, with PC maker Lenovo Group (HK:0992) rallying 6.1% after it unveiled over 40 new devices and products powered by AI at the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nHype over AI came back into play after chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- which is at the heart of an AI-fuelled rally in 2023- surged over 6% to record highs on Monday, as New Street Research named the stock among its top picks for 2024. These gains spilled over into Asian stocks.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.3%, with gains in broader tech helping offset a 0.5% decline in Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930), after the conglomerate clocked a 35% slump in its fourth-quarter profit.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsung’s peer SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which develops advanced memory chips linked to AI development, rose over 2% even as Samsung’s earnings pointed to more near-term pain for chip demand.\n\nGains in tech stocks were also driven by a heavy dose of bargain hunting, as the sector was battered in the first week of 2024 amid growing doubts that the Fed will cut interest rates early in 2024. These doubts still remained in play ahead of key U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data due this Thursday, which is expected to show a mild increase in inflation in December.\n\nBroader Asian stocks also advanced. Australia’s ASX 200 rose 1.1% after data showed a bigger-than-expected jump in retail sales through November. A reading on Australian CPI inflation is due on Wednesday.\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 rose 0.1% from a five-year low, while the Shanghai Composite index rose 0.2% from an over 13-month low. Chinese inflation and trade figures are also on tap later this week.\n\nChinese stocks were among the worst performers in Asia in 2023, as a post-COVID economic recovery in the country largely failed to materialize.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a mildly positive open, with the index set to recover from steep losses in the first week of 2024. Focus this week is also on quarterly earnings from index heavyweights Infosys Ltd (NS:INFY) and Wipro Ltd (NS:WIPR), as well as Indian CPI data for December.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

Piper Sandler has pointed out in a note that Nvidia's GPU building capacity foreshadows a growth for application software-based stocks as generational AI and data processing capabilities pick up.\n\nPiper Sandler Senior Research Analyst Brent Bracelin joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the note and why stocks like Workday (WDAY) , Monday.com (MNDY), and Klaviyo (KVYO) are some top ideas to own in 2024.\n\nBracelin explains why there's a great investment opportunity with these stocks: \"There were over 40 cloud software companies growing over 30% back in 2021. If you fast forward to next year there's only four. So growth is scarce again. We think we're entering a whole new investment cycle for these cloud application companies. This time it's really driven by the need to move these applications, these old applications where your data is locked up in on-prem software, you have to modernize to unlock the data and open up some new AI opportunities. So we're at the beginning of what we think is a big generational investment cycle.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino",

        "title": "The 3 Best AI Stocks to Buy in January 2024",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence buzz has taken the world by storm. However, only a few stocks have shown tangible revenue benefits from AI in the current market. Thus, investors must diligently separate the best AI stocks from the pretenders.\n\nAccording to analysts, the AI revolution is just beginning. Dan Ives of Wedbush predicts it will be the fourth industrial revolution. He draws a parallel to the emergence of the internet in 1995 and expects a secular growth cycle. Notably, AI could revolutionize multiple industries and enterprises are showing increased use cases.\n\nSome industries have been using AI for a while. For instance, Google has applied AI for several years to improve its search results. Another early adopter of AI has been the cybersecurity industry. Companies in the industry have been leveraging AI for threat detection. These successful applications highlight the potential for AI in other industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter a great start for generative AI players in 2023, more upside lies ahead. The technology will drive investment and growth in chips, systems and software. Below are some of the best AI stocks to buy for 2024.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor stocks have gotten off to a rocky start in 2024, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) flat year-to-date. However, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is bucking the trend and outperforming the index. Unlike other semiconductor stocks suffering from fears of a weak auto market, analysts expect its end markets to remain robust.\n\nPrimarily, the company provides advanced graphic processing units for data centers and gaming. The generative AI boom has caused a surge in demand for its chips due to their suitability for AI applications. Notably, the company has a monopoly in data center AI chips and will dominate the market for several years.\n\nSo why is NVDA stock one of the best AI stocks after its 200% gain? According to Bank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) Vivek Arya, generative AI will be a growth theme for over a decade. It will spur a data center upgrade cycle and investments in software and systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince Nvidia has the best AI chips, the analyst sees more upside to Nvidia numbers. He projects that Nvidia will generate over $100 billion in free cash flow over calendar year 2024 and 2025. Additionally, he expects impressive 50% free cash flow margins.\n\nBesides, the analyst expects more upside from new products. Nvidia plans to unveil its recent AI advancements at CES 2024. Per its product roadmap, the company will release its GH200 Grace Hopper and B100 in 2024. These new products will maintain Nvidia’s competitive advantage. Also, they will increase revenue growth due to their higher average selling prices.\n\nAlthough Nvidia was one of the best AI stocks in 2023 and gained over 200%, more upside awaits. Generative AI has triggered a new investment cycle in the data center, spurring demand for advanced AI chips.\n\nVertiv Holdings (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) is another play on the growth of AI. The company manufactures power management and cooling systems for data centers. It provides global data center customers with power and thermal management, IT systems and infrastructure solutions.\n\nThe rise in AI means more data, storage needs, and processing power. Due to large AI datasets and heavy processing, modern high-density data centers use more power and are prone to overheating. Thus, these data center servers need a reliable cooling system. That’s where Vertiv comes in with its power management, thermal management and cooling solutions.\n\nThe company continues to enjoy solid demand for its liquid cooling and power distribution solutions applicable to high-density GPUs. Analysts project a 24.4% CAGR for these cooling solutions globally over the next five years. These trends concur with financial reports, with management stating in Q3 2023 comments that they expect more growth from AI. Specifically, they see an acceleration in the data center market in 2024.\n\nVertiv acquired CoolTera Ltd, a critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions provider, in December 2023 to bolster its position. The acquisition will strengthen Vertiv’s high-density cooling portfolio and improve its offering to global data center customers.\n\nDue to robust demand, management projected a strong finish to 2023, with sales between $6.875 and $6.895 billion, a 22% year-over-year growth. Moreover, the company is returning capital and has a $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Vertiv is ready for AI with its comprehensive end-to-end data center power and thermal management solutions portfolio.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the major beneficiaries of AI has been memory companies. Large language models train on huge datasets, requiring a lot of memory and storage. This will be a tailwind for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), one of the key players in the memory market.\n\nSince AI projects require more memory, demand for Micron’s high bandwidth products is surging. In the Q1 fiscal year 2024 earnings call, management highlighted that generative AI will be a growth tailwind. “Memory is at the heart of GPU-enabled AI servers, and we are already seeing strong demand driven by early deployment of AI solutions, which will only accelerate over time,” noted CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.\n\nThe company launched its HBM3 product to capture the anticipated higher demand from AI and accelerated computing end markets. The product has received high customer reviews due to its better performance and lower power consumption than competing products. As a result, several analysts have upgraded MU stock, pointing to this tailwind.\n\nBMO has an “outperform” rating and a $90 price target. Its analysts have raised 2024 estimates, noting that demand from AI will be robust. Similarly, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya is confident about AI tailwinds. He notes that Micron is gaining momentum in AI servers and will likely be included in Nvidia’s H200.\n\nIn 2024, generative AI will move to consumer devices such as laptops and mobile phones. Micron is well-positioned through its portfolio to capture this memory and storage market. Considering these tailwinds, it is one of the best AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Says This Company Is the \"Godfather of AI.\" Here's Why I Think the Stock Looks Undervalued.",
        "content": "Hype around artificial intelligence (AI) rocked the markets in 2023, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq soaring more than 40%.\n\nThe megacap Magnificent Seven stocks were at the epicenter of AI mania, and perhaps their most influential member is semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company saw its market cap balloon in 2023, and it joined Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet in the exclusive $1 trillion market-cap club.\n\nIt's no surprise that Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities crowned Nvidia as the godfather of AI.\n\nAfter surging 237% last year, some might think now is the time for profit taking. But what if I told you that Nvidia stock could be undervalued?\n\nLet's explore how the company is leading the charge in AI, and why now might be as good a time as ever to scoop up some shares.\n\nDemand is off the charts\n\nNvidia has developed a host of graphics processing units (GPUs). The bedrocks of its GPU line are the A100 and H100 chips, the latter of which is experiencing unprecedented demand. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates Nvidia's quarterly revenue during the past decade. The big takeaway is that the slope of the line really steepens starting in 2023.\n\nFor the third quarter of the company's fiscal 2024, ended Oct. 29, Nvidia reported a record $18.1 billion in revenue, an increase of more than 200% year over year. Moreover, the company's profit increased nearly 500% through the first three quarters of its fiscal year.\n\nIf this wasn't enough to get your attention, consider that Wall Street is forecasting revenue to rise 54% this fiscal year, followed by another 20% the year after. Although this technically shows decelerating revenue, I'd say that is appropriate.\n\nIt's unrealistic for investors to expect triple-digit percentage revenue growth in perpetuity. Moreover, while Nvidia dominates the AI application market for data center GPUs, there are other competitors gaining steam. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nWith 2024 looking like another milestone year for Nvidia, investors might be wondering how attractive the stock is from a valuation perspective.\n\nStory continues Image Source: Getty Images\n\nNvidia's valuation looks tempting\n\nAs of the time of this writing, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24.8. By comparison, the company's top competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, trades at a forward P/E of 37.\n\nWhile AMD is making progress of its own, it is far behind Nvidia. Considering Nvidia's growth relative to AMD, fueled by its dominant market share in AI data center GPUs, the disparity between valuation multiples is a head-scratcher.\n\nOn top of that, the forward P/E of the S&P 500 is 21.7 -- not too far behind Nvidia. Given the company's stellar performance in 2023 and its strong outlook for this year, it's hard to see why Nvidia doesn't carry a higher premium.\n\nMy hunch is that investors are acting with more emotion than logic when it comes to Nvidia. The stock's performance throughout 2023 and the company's admission to the $1 trillion market-cap club might give off vibes of an expensive stock. However, the multiples above could suggest that Nvidia is growing into its valuation, and the stock could actually be cheap.\n\nI think Nvidia will continue to benefit from the secular tailwinds of AI, and now looks like a terrific time to begin dollar-cost averaging into a long-term position at a bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were moving higher today after investors responded well to a series of announcements at CES today, which included new chips for generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, PCs and gaming, and new partnerships.\n\nAs a result, the stock was up 5.4% as of 2:34 p.m. ET. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia does it again\n\nThe AI stock rose quickly this morning even before its CES presentation as investors anticipated good news.\n\nDuring its presentation, Nvidia unveiled a slew of new chips, including new desktop graphics chips to make it easier to use AI on a PC. The company also announced new GeForce RTX graphics cards, which offer 4K resolution and ray tracing, meaning they can create an image by tracking individual rays of light.\n\nNvidia said these new components were an \"order of magnitude\" better than computers powered by Intel chips. Nvidia hasn't traditionally been a major player in the large market for PC chips, but these new releases and its prowess in AI could help it gain market share in that subsector of the semiconductor industry.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia announced new partnerships with companies like Amgen to use Nvidia's generative AI tools for drug discovery and data insights; Getty Images, which will use Nvidia's Picasso for a new image generation service, and with autonomous vehicle developers such as Li Auto.\n\nWhat's next for Nvidia?\n\nNvidia is clearly in the driver's seat in the AI race after its revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter, and the company is unlikely to relinquish that leading position without a fight. Today's news shows that Nvidia has no intention of slowing down and will continue to innovate and launch breakthrough products.\n\nIf you're looking for an AI stock to own, Nvidia still seems like a no-brainer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter operating profit likely fell by about 35%, as a sluggish recovery in demand for the firm’s key memory and smartphone chips dented revenue.\n\nSamsung’s operating profit in the three months to Dec 31 likely fell to 2.8 trillion won ($2.1 billion) from 3.7 trillion won a year ago. Revenue fell to 67.40 trillion won from 70.46 trillion won a year ago, while also missing Investing.com estimates of 70.1 trillion won.\n\nThe South Korean conglomerate will release a full earnings report on Jan 31.\n\nBut Tuesday’s results show that the company is still grappling with a sharp slowdown in chip demand over the past two years. A bulk of this was driven by slowing demand for consumer electronics, as rising interest rates and high inflation across most of the globe saw consumers drastically scale back discretionary spending on electronics.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), for instance, which is a key buyer of memory chips, processors and smartphone displays from Samsung, saw its iPhone sales in China decline for the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nWeakening iPhone sales are likely to herald a similar trend for Samsung’s own smartphone offerings, the Galaxy and foldables ranges.\n\nCorporate investment in tech infrastructure slowed substantially over the past two years, which in turn dented demand for memory chips used in network infrastructure.\n\nThe weak earnings also indicated that an artificial intelligence-driven rebound in demand for chips remained weak. The firm had in late-2023 forecast an eventual pick-up in demand on the back of increased interest in AI, which has greatly benefited peers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nBut while Nvidia makes specialized chips for running the large language models powering programs such as ChatGPT, Samsung faces stiff competition from rivals such as SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) and U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) in selling high-density memory chips, which are geared towards AI development.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

        "content": "The start of a new year is the time to take a look at your portfolio and make the necessary changes. While it may not be possible for you to sell stocks unless you are making a profit on them, it can certainly be possible for you to keep a watch on the best stocks of 2024 that have the potential to make big gains this year.\n\nIf you are considering rebalancing the portfolio, now is the perfect time to grab these seven stocks and take home big gains at the end of the year. While it is hard to predict how the market will move from here, it is definitely possible to identify strong companies and pick stocks that have shown a solid performance in 2023. Here are the best stocks for 2024.\n\nBest stocks for 2024: Li Auto (LI) Li Auto logo and store in downtown Lujiazui. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. Business and finance concept photo.\n\nSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a Chinese EV maker that made a lot of noise in 2023. It is entering the new year on a high note and could grab a higher market share this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile automakers were worried about the slowing EV demand, Li Auto continued to report strong delivery numbers quarter after quarter. In the final quarter, it reported 131,805 deliveries, up 184% year-over-year (YOY) with 50,353 deliveries in December.\n\nLi will start deliveries of Li Mega in March and this could lead to higher revenue in the quarter. The company has met expectations quarter after quarter, and I believe it will do so in the fourth quarter again. As one of the top EV makers right now, Li is leading the race to the top.\n\nThe stock looks undervalued to me at $35 and it has the potential to hit $50 in 2024. The company has managed to thrive in uncertain market situations and it will continue to do so.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nThe biggest competitor of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Warren Buffet’s favorite EV company, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) has broken Tesla’s records. BYD Co. reported a record sales quarter with 526,409 deliveries while Tesla sold 484,000 cars. BYD Co. has been consistently growing its market share by offering cars priced lower than Tesla. It is also the second-largest battery maker in the world and is gradually expanding its global market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt sold three million battery-powered cars in 2023, which is its highest ever and a 62% rise over 2022. This means its profit has also exploded. BYD has resorted to price cuts to ensure steady sales growth and it has managed to manuver through the uncertain market conditions.\n\nAs the EV demand picks up, BYD could continue moving upwards. While Tesla lost its market share to other EV makers, BYD continued to expand to different countries. It is investing in production facilities and aims to increase production in 2024. It is building an assembly plant in Hungary and has also opened dealerships in Sweden, Norway, and Germany.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) is a hot fintech stock that can double your money. 2024 could be the year of SoFi as it eyes profitability and reports an impressive quarter. The company has seen a rise in deposits and could also see an increase in personal loans as student loan payment resumes.\n\nThat said, SoFi offers a one-stop solution to its users and this is how it continues to attract new users each quarter. In the third quarter, it added over 7 million users on the platform and it was the company’s tenth consecutive quarter of record revenue.\n\nThe company appears to be in line to report a profit in the coming quarter, and if it continues to grow the user base, it will become one of the top fintech disrupters in the country. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood has been loading up on SOFI stock and holds more than 1.7 million shares.\n\nSOFI is trading at $8.31, and this is one stock that will double in 2024. Buy it below $10 and take home big gains.\n\nBest stocks for 2024: Affirm (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuy now, pay later has gained immense popularity across the country and the record Black Friday sales showed that people like the flexibility of buying now and paying in regular intervals. This has brought Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) to the limelight, and the stock soared over 200% in the past six months.\n\nAFRM stock has gone from $16 in July to $43 today, and this upward momentum is set to continue in the coming months. I believe Affirm will report stellar fourth-quarter results driven by Black Friday sales and holiday shopping, and this will give a boost to the stock.\n\nThe company already has partnerships with several e-commerce providers and recently inked a partnership with Walmart (NYSE:WMT). This will help it reach a wider user base and see an increase in revenue. It is the key partnerships that have helped the company achieve new levels of growth.\n\nWhile the company is reporting losses and faces stiff competition in the market, it is set to benefit from an improvement in consumer spending over the next few months.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

The tech giant has invested heavily into artificial intelligence (AI) and this investment is expected to start paying off in the coming year.\n\nThe company generated $211.9 billion in revenue for the year, and it is only going to get bigger. It launched Microsoft 365 last year and it comes with a subscription cost of $30 per month. The company expects to generate significant revenue from the same.\n\nAdditionally, the company has managed to see explosive earnings in 2023 and is starting the new year on a high note. MSFT stock pays a modest dividend of 0.80% and the stock is trading at $370, close to its 52-week high of $384. The stock might look expensive right now but it will be hitting $400 very soon. This is one stock to own for explosive gains in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

This company offers everything you want to own including cars. It has a long history, a strong balance sheet, and a solid growth plan.\n\nAmazon has impressed investors with the steady upside momentum, and the recent quarter showed the success of Amazon advertising and Amazon Web Services. Its AWS revenue increased 12% in the recent quarter and it still has a lot of space to grow.\n\nI believe the company will be able to report better numbers in the coming quarterly results due to the holiday season and we could see a strong growth in the advertising revenue as the economy improves. Amazon has also invested in AI and integrated it into its services to ensure higher client satisfaction. Trading at $148 today, the stock is going to grow in 2024.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one stock that could continue moving higher in the years to come. It is still one of the best stocks to invest in for 2024. However, it will not be possible for the company to repeat the rally it enjoyed in 2023. Nvidia is one of the biggest players in the AI space, and it has already delivered over 500,000 of its H100 AI chips in the third quarter and saw a 200% rise in the revenue.\n\nNvidia has reported impressive revenue numbers in the last three quarters, and I expect the same in the coming year. It has already launched the H200 AI chip which can generate output twice as fast as H100.\n\nI believe the company delivers what it promises and this is why it is one of the best tech companies in the world right now. NVDA stock is up 245% in the year and is exchanging hands for $475 today. It is a hot stock with the potential to hit $550 in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is making big gains in Monday's trading. The company's share price was up 5.3% as of 2:30 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nNvidia stock is gaining ground due to the company's product announcements and excitement surrounding this year's CES consumer electronics event. In addition to excitement about new hardware products that could be revealed during the show, Nvidia's share price also appears to be climbing higher due to investors putting less focus on macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nIs Nvidia a top AI stock to buy for 2024?\n\nMultiple reports emerged from analysts today suggesting that the Federal Reserve will pursue significant rate cutting initiatives over the next couple of years. While the recent forecasts for the schedule of rate progressions differ, the broader consensus outlook points to expectations for a significant rate reduction on the horizon. If that comes to pass, Nvidia and other growth-dependent stocks could enjoy significant expansion for their valuation multiples.\n\nIn addition to favorable macroeconomic analysis, Nvidia stock is also enjoying bullish momentum in conjunction with this year's CES expo. The graphics processing unit (GPU) specialist detailed new processors tailored for the generative artificial intelligence (AI), automotive, and gaming markets. Notably, today is still the first day of the expo, and it's possible that the GPU leader will have other big news to announce before the expo closes on Jan. 12.\n\nEven with the explosive gains the company has made over the last year and some uncertainty about the company's performance on the near-term horizon, Nvidia stock still looks like a top buy for investors looking to profit on AI trends in 2024 and beyond. The company's leading position in GPU hardware and initiatives to expand its software and services-based business put the company in position to continue delivering strong sales and earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia continues to enjoy a forefront position in the AI space. For investors, the stock continues to look like a worthwhile buy for 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 5.1% in the morning session after Reuters reported that four Chinese electric vehicle brands, Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, Zeekr, and Xiaomi's new EV (electric vehicle) unit, will use Nvidia's DRIVE technology for their automated driving systems.\n\nThe Nvidia DRIVE platform is a collection of technologies developed by Nvidia for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). It includes hardware and software components designed to enable vehicles to perceive and respond to their environment, ultimately achieving higher levels of automation. Given the potential in the booming Chinese EV market, this update hints at possible new growth opportunities for Nvidia in the region.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 13 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 8 months ago, when the stock gained 23.7% on the news that the company delivered an exceptional quarter that topped analysts' estimates across key metrics. Revenue surpassed expectations by an impressive 10.3%, driven by strong data center revenue. Notably, the company improved profitability, with both gross margin and operating margin outperforming expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) beat by an impressive 18.8%. Inventory levels experienced a nice decrease during the quarter. In addition to the outstanding quarterly results, the revenue guidance for the next quarter surpassed expectations by over 50%. Yes, that's not a typo. Similarly, the operating profit guidance exceeded Consensus estimates meaningfully.\n\nStory continues\n\nFounder and CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the ongoing transformations in the computer industry, particularly the advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI. He highlighted Nvidia's readiness to seize the opportunities presented by the anticipated trillion-dollar shift in global data center infrastructure from general-purpose to accelerated computing, as firms implement generative AI into their business operations. Overall, the company's blowout quarter, with its impressive revenue growth, enhanced profitability, and positive guidance, underscored its strength in the market. Nothing in this world is perfect, but this was a near-perfect quarter.\n\nNvidia is up 7.5% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $14,808.\n\nDo you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

        "title": "Why Intel, TSMC, and AMD Stocks All Just Popped",
        "content": "After a rocky start to the year, semiconductor stocks are turning around in a big way on Monday.\n\nDuring the first week of 2024, some of the world's most famous semiconductor companies -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) -- declined in the wake of December's Santa Claus rally.\n\nAs the stock market started to find its footing in the second week, however, shares of all three of these companies flipped from sinking to rising. As of 12:05 p.m. ET, TSMC shares were up 2.9%, Intel stock was up a solid 3.4%, and AMD was doing the best of all with a 5.1% gain.\n\nYou can probably thank President Joe Biden for that.\n\nBad news for China is good news for everyone else\n\nBy now, you've certainly heard about the Biden administration's plans to curtail China's access to some of the most advanced chips available to support artificial intelligence functions. That section of the market is dominated by Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has been feeling the lion's share of the impact from export restrictions on those types of chips. Other companies have been little affected.\n\nHowever, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday morning that the Biden administration is now shifting its attention to less advanced, older-generation computer chips used in industries other than AI -- in consumer electronics, military weapons, and cars, for example. These kinds of semiconductor chips are more likely to be produced in and exported from China rather than imported into China. Indeed, as the WSJ article highlights, China is downright dominant in this segment of the semiconductor industry -- and President Biden wants to do something about that.\n\nMeanwhile, worrying that China might leverage its dominant position in lower-end chips to punish the U.S. in a future trade war, Congress has been urging the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to take steps to protect the supply chain for these chips by awarding subsidies to expand domestic semiconductor production on the one hand and imposing tariffs on chips imported from China on the other.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat this means for Intel, Taiwan Semi, and AMD\n\nThis effort is still in its early days, but already, the WSJ notes that the Commerce Department has awarded $162 million in subsidies to help Microchip Technology expand production of microcontrollers for cars and appliances. The Commerce Department is also said to be putting together a list of other U.S. companies that might receive government support to counter China's rapidly growing industry producing lower-end chips.\n\nDon't get too excited just yet. While Intel, Taiwan Semi, and AMD stocks are all rising on Monday's news, there's no guarantee that any of these companies will end up getting subsidies directly aimed at supporting their lower-end chip production. To the contrary, semiconductor companies like Marvell, Texas Instruments, and Microchip all spring to mind more readily when one thinks of lower-end chips. And all of those stocks are rising Monday, too.\n\nThat said, if you did want to place a bet on one of the high-profile chipmakers named above based on this newest effort to subsidize domestic chip production, Taiwan Semiconductor looks like the safest bet to make. Trading at less than 16 times forward earnings, it's significantly cheaper than Intel at 26 times forward earnings -- and less than half the price of AMD at 37 times forward earnings. TSMC is also trading at a cheaper valuation than Marvell, TI, or Microchip.\n\nStrange as it may be to say it, Taiwan Semiconductor may end up being the biggest beneficiary of all if the U.S. trade war in semiconductor chips continues.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Nvidia Rolls Out New Chips, Claims Leadership of AI PC Race",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., whose chip technology dominates in data centers used to create artificial intelligence software, announced new products to help the personal computer industry lure consumers with “AI PCs.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ Says Boeing Slumps After Panel Blowout Leads to Partial 737 Grounding China Says It Caught Foreign Consultant Spying for UK’s MI6\n\nNvidia unveiled three new desktop graphics chips with extra components that will let gamers, designers and other computer users make better use of AI on their personal machines without having to rely on remote services accessed over the internet. The chips, updated versions of existing offerings, will be offered at a “great new price,” the company said Monday in a presentation at the CES trade show.\n\nNvidia rivals Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have already touted what they say is a new era for the industry: AI PCs. The companies argue that AI software is more secure and responsive when it’s run on the PCs themselves rather than over the internet. Nvidia now claims its graphics chips are the best engines to power the new types of laptops and desktops.\n\nThe new GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER will get more processing cores and faster memory. It can run Stable Diffusion XL image generation software 1.7 times faster than the equivalent model from the previous generation of Nvidia technology, the company said. The new chip will also power games with ray tracing — building an image by calculating the path of individual rays of light – at 4K resolution.\n\nThe product is scheduled to go on sale Jan. 31 for $999. The company also unveiled an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER for $799 and a 4070 Super for $599, which will be available later this month.\n\nPaired with new software and optimizations of AI models that Nvidia is also releasing, the products will offer an “order of magnitude” improvement over machines that are powered by Intel chips, according to Justin Walker, an Nvidia vice president.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s stock rose as much as 5% in New York trading Monday, taking it back above $500 a share to a record high. The stock more than tripled last year, giving the company a market value of more than $1 trillion.\n\nAfter a spike in sales during the pandemic, PC shipments have fallen steeply, leaving makers and component suppliers burdened with inventory and little growth. Nvidia has avoided the worst of the PC plunge by owning the market for accelerator chips used to create AI software in data centers. The explosion in demand for that more expensive type of chip has pushed Nvidia’s market value past $1 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the history of the semiconductor industry.\n\nFor computer chipmakers in general, though, the majority of the volume they ship still goes into PCs. They’re searching for a way to persuade laptop owners and corporate buyers to upgrade their equipment and have begun touting AI capabilities as a reason for new purchases.\n\nNvidia said the new chips will provide more realistic gaming with high-definition images enhanced by AI, which will also generate improved dialog by in-game characters. In another example, the products will provide more responsive tools for image-editing software from companies such as Adobe Inc. There are currently 500 applications that are tuned to work better with AI and Nvidia’s RTX technology, the company said.\n\nNvidia is the largest maker of graphics processors, or GPUs. Gamers are willing to pay thousands of dollars for cards that upgrade their experience, which make the company’s chips a premium addition to PCs. Nvidia’s main rival in that market is AMD. Intel and AMD also offer central processing units that have graphics capabilities.\n\nSeparately, Nvidia said the capabilities of its new products won’t trigger rules put in place by the US government to limit the export of AI-related chips to China. The top-of-the-line GTX 4090 already fell afoul of those restrictions, requiring Nvidia to produce a less-capable version for that market.\n\n(Updates with chart after fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity’s Horrible, No-Good ’23 Set to Continue Into ’24 Can Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump’s?

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is surfing the AI wave into CES 2024 with the debut of its GeForce RTX 40 Super series of desktop graphics cards. The lineup, which is made up of the high-end RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, is primarily designed for gaming, but Nvidia is also pitching it as cadre of AI powerhouses.\n\nThe RTX 4080 Super starts at $999 and is 1.4x faster than the RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 4070 Ti Super, meanwhile, is 1.6x faster than the RTX 3070 Ti. But, according to the company, those performance gains jump significantly when you add in Nvidia's AI-powered Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). Nvidia is marketing its new RTX 40 Super line of graphics cards as AI powerhouses. (Nvidia) (Nvidia)\n\nWith DLSS, the RTX 4080 Super is twice as fast as the RTX 3080 Ti, while the RTX 4070 Ti Super is 2.5x faster than the RTX 3070 Ti with DLSS. Even the RTX 4070 Super gets a big boost with DLSS, with 1.5x better performance than the RTX 3090.\n\nThat's a lot of names and numbers, but suffice it to say, these cards are going to offer gamers a sizable upgrade over Nvidia's prior generation of desktop graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBut Nvidia is also framing these cards as powerful options for AI PCs, the new class of laptops and desktops designed to run AI applications natively rather than in the cloud. Nvidia joins AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) in the push to drive AI PCs into the consumer and enterprise landscape.\n\nThe idea behind AI PCs is that they will allow consumers and business users to access generative AI apps from their own devices, which should ensure that their private data isn't uploaded to the cloud or used to train AI software. But Intel and AMD have admitted that they're still waiting to see what kinds of programs and platforms developers come up with that take advantage of AI PC features.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is so dedicated to the concept of the AI PC that it and its manufacturing partners are adding dedicated Copilot AI assistant keys to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The first new keyboard key in nearly three decades, the Copilot button will call up the Windows Copilot assistant similar to how the Windows key brings up the Start menu.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has been riding the AI train like no other company, with shares of the chip giant up a staggering 244% over the last 12 months. Shares of rivals AMD and Intel are up 122% and 70%, respectively.\n\nAnd while you can point to Nvidia's data center business as the main reason for its stock performance, its gaming segment is still an important revenue stream. In its most recently quarterly report, Nvidia's gaming segment accounted for $2.86 billion of its $18.12 billion in total revenue. That said, Data Center took in $14.51 billion.

        "content": "NVIDIA\n\nLeading AI Platform Gets RTX-Accelerated Boost From New GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, AI Laptops From Every Top Manufacturer\n\nNVIDIA Generative AI for PCs NVIDIA GeForce RTX SUPER desktop GPUs, new AI laptops from every top manufacturer, and new NVIDIA RTX accelerated AI software and tools offer supercharged generative AI performance.\n\nLAS VEGAS, Jan. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES—NVIDIA today announced GeForce RTX™ SUPER desktop GPUs for supercharged generative AI performance, new AI laptops from every top manufacturer, and new NVIDIA RTX™-accelerated AI software and tools for both developers and consumers.\n\nBuilding on decades of PC leadership, with over 100 million of its RTX GPUs driving the AI PC era, NVIDIA is now offering these tools to enhance PC experiences with generative AI: NVIDIA TensorRT™ acceleration of the popular Stable Diffusion XL model for text-to-image workflows, NVIDIA RTX Remix with generative AI texture tools, NVIDIA ACE microservices and more games that use DLSS 3 technology with Frame Generation.\n\nAI Workbench, a unified, easy-to-use toolkit for AI developers, will be available in beta later this month. In addition, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM (TRT-LLM), an open-source library that accelerates and optimizes inference performance of the latest large language models (LLMs), now supports more pre-optimized models for PCs. Accelerated by TRT-LLM, Chat with RTX, an NVIDIA tech demo also releasing this month, allows AI enthusiasts to interact with their notes, documents and other content.\n\n“Generative AI is the single most significant platform transition in computing history and will transform every industry, including gaming,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With over 100 million RTX AI PCs and workstations, NVIDIA is a massive installed base for developers and gamers to enjoy the magic of generative AI.”\n\nRunning generative AI locally on a PC is critical for privacy, latency and cost-sensitive applications. It requires a large installed base of AI-ready systems, as well as the right developer tools to tune and optimize AI models for the PC platform.\n\nTo meet these needs, NVIDIA is delivering innovations across its full technology stack, driving new experiences and building on the 500+ AI-enabled PC applications and games already accelerated by NVIDIA RTX technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nRTX AI PCs and Workstations\r\nNVIDIA RTX GPUs — capable of running a broad range of applications at the highest performance — unlock the full potential of generative AI on PCs. Tensor Cores in these GPUs dramatically speed AI performance across the most demanding applications for work and play.\n\nThe new GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series graphics cards, also announced today at CES, include the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, 4070 Ti SUPER and 4070 SUPER for top AI performance. The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER generates AI video 1.5x faster — and images 1.7x faster — than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU. The Tensor Cores in SUPER GPUs deliver up to 836 trillion operations per second, bringing transformative AI capabilities to gaming, creating and everyday productivity.\n\nLeading manufacturers — including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung — are releasing a new wave of RTX AI laptops, bringing a full set of generative AI capabilities to users right out of the box. The new systems, which deliver a performance increase ranging from 20x-60x compared with using neural processing units, will start shipping this month.\n\nMobile workstations with RTX GPUs can run NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including TensorRT and NVIDIA RAPIDS™ for simplified, secure generative AI and data science development. A three-year license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is included with every NVIDIA A800 40GB Active GPU, providing an ideal workstation development platform for AI and data science.\n\nNew PC Developer Tools for Building AI Models\r\nTo help developers quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models and LLMs using PC-class performance and memory footprint, NVIDIA recently announced NVIDIA AI Workbench.\n\nAI Workbench, which will be available in beta later this month, offers streamlined access to popular repositories like Hugging Face, GitHub and NVIDIA NGC™, along with a simplified user interface that enables developers to easily reproduce, collaborate on and migrate projects.\n\nProjects can be scaled out to virtually anywhere — whether the data center, a public cloud or NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud — and then brought back to local RTX systems on a PC or workstation for inference and light customization.\n\nIn collaboration with HP, NVIDIA is also simplifying AI model development by integrating NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Endpoints, which include RTX-accelerated AI models and software development kits, into the HP AI Studio, a centralized platform for data science. This will allow users to easily search, import and deploy optimized models across PCs and the cloud.\n\nAfter building AI models for PC use cases, developers can optimize them using NVIDIA TensorRT to take full advantage of RTX GPUs’ Tensor Cores.\n\nNVIDIA recently extended TensorRT to text-based applications with TensorRT-LLM for Windows, an open-source library for accelerating LLMs. The latest update to TensorRT-LLM, available now, adds Phi-2 to the growing list of pre-optimized models for PC, which run up to 5x faster compared to other inference backends.\n\nRTX-Accelerated Generative AI Powers New PC Experiences\r\nAt CES, NVIDIA and its developer partners are releasing new generative AI-powered applications and services for PCs, including:\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix, a platform for creating stunning RTX remasters of classic games. Releasing in beta later this month, it delivers generative AI tools that can transform basic textures from classic games into modern, 4K-resolution, physically based rendering materials. NVIDIA ACE microservices, including generative AI-powered speech and animation models, which enable developers to add intelligent, dynamic digital avatars to games. TensorRT acceleration for Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) Turbo and latent consistency models, two of the most popular Stable Diffusion acceleration methods. TensorRT improves performance for both by up to 60% compared with the previous fastest implementation. An updated version of the Stable Diffusion WebUI TensorRT extension is also now available, including acceleration for SDXL, SDXL Turbo, LCM - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and improved LoRA support. NVIDIA DLSS 3 with Frame Generation, which uses AI to increase frame rates up to 4x compared with native rendering, will be featured in a dozen of the 14 new RTX games announced, including Horizon Forbidden West, Pax Dei and Dragon’s Dogma 2. Chat with RTX, an NVIDIA tech demo available later this month, allows AI enthusiasts to easily connect PC LLMs to their own data using a popular technique known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The demo, accelerated by TensorRT-LLM, enables users to quickly interact with their notes, documents and other content. It will also be available as an open-source reference project, so developers can easily implement the same capabilities in their own applications.\n\nLearn more about the latest generative AI breakthroughs by joining NVIDIA at CES.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

        "content": "There are many ways to make money in the stock market. Some investors like to peruse lists of the best-performing stocks in search of highfliers that are set to soar even higher. Others like to bet on beaten-down equities that are due for a rebound.\n\nWhichever strategy you prefer, you'll likely find something to like about the following two stocks -- both of which appear set to surge in the coming year.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWinners tend to keep on winning. That's one of the most powerful lessons I learned during my analyst training at The Motley Fool. So when people ask me how they can profit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, I urge them to look first at the companies that are already dominating the AI industry -- and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is at the top of the list.\n\nNvidia designs computer chips that power the most cutting-edge AI applications. With businesses of all sizes seeking to obtain the tremendous productivity and efficiency gains that AI can bring about, demand for Nvidia's chips is soaring.\n\nThe semiconductor leader's sales surged 206% year over year to $18.1 billion in the quarter that ended on Oct. 29. Its adjusted operating income climbed an even more impressive 652% to $11.6 billion.\n\nMuch more growth lies ahead. The AI chip market will explode to $400 billion by 2027, according to fellow chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. Thus, when combined with the enormous demand for chips for video game systems, autonomous vehicles, and cloud services, Nvidia thinks its total market opportunity could be as large as $1 trillion.\n\nBetter still, despite its torrid growth and fortune-building share-price gains in 2023, Nvidia's stock can still be had for an attractive valuation today. Its shares currently trade for less than 40 times its projected earnings in 2024 and 24 times estimates for 2025. That's still a bargain for an elite business that's set to grow its profits by 268% this year and 66% next year.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Rivian Automotive\n\nWhile the market's best-performing stocks can certainly continue to head higher, there's also something fun about buying stocks when they're on sale. One heavily discounted stock that's caught my eye is Rivian Automotive(NASDAQ: RIVN). The electric vehicle (EV) upstart's shares are down about 90% from the highs they reached shortly after its initial public offering (IPO) in November 2021. But brighter days lie ahead for this future industry leader.\n\nRivian's R1T pickup trucks and R1S SUVs are selling briskly. The automaker delivered 50,122 vehicles in 2023, up from 20,332 EVs in 2022. Rivian, in turn, is expected to report a 165% increase in sales to $4.4 billion when it announces its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 21.\n\nMoreover, Rivian's margins are improving as it boosts production. The company is working to wring out costs from its manufacturing operations. Management expects these efforts, combined with a simpler and cheaper battery pack design, to help Rivian produce positive gross profit in 2024.\n\nImportantly, Rivian's balance sheet strength -- it held over $9 billion in cash and investments as of Sept. 30 -- should give it most of the capital it needs to reach its profitability goals. That ought to limit any further shareholder dilution. More equity or debt offerings could be required, but Rivian should find it easier to obtain financing on better terms as its operational results strengthen.\n\nAll told, Rivian produced 57,232 vehicles in 2023, up from 24,337 in 2022. That figure is likely to continue to head sharply higher in the coming years. With EV unit sales projected to reach a whopping 73 million EVs by 2040, according to Goldman Sachs, Rivian has a long runway for further expansion.\n\nA promising new deal with AT&T should help. The telecom titan will buy an as-yet undisclosed number of EVs from Rivian as part of its efforts to curb emissions and cut costs.\n\nConsider buying shares today, and you can position yourself to profit from any future deals Rivian signs with other large fleet operators, as well as its rapidly growing sales to consumers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Rivian Automotive wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "AMD debuts AI-focused Ryzen 8000G desktop chips at CES 2024",
        "content": "AMD (AMD) is bringing the AI PC race to the world of desktop computers at CES 2024 with the debut of what it says is the world’s first desktop processor with a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU).\n\nComing to AMD’s upcoming Ryzen 8000G series chips, which hit the market Jan. 31, the NPU is designed to handle AI-based tasks on your desktop computer without having to send data to the cloud.\n\nApple (AAPL) already offers a dedicated neural engine in its M line of processors for its Mac laptops and desktops, but AMD says it’s the first to put a dedicated NPU in an x86 desktop chip. Apple’s chips are based on ARM processors.\n\nThe AI PC revolution is seen as the next major growth area for the PC industry, as manufacturers and developers lean into the massive explosion in interest in AI following the debut of ChatGPT in 2022. AMD, Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each already debuted their own laptop chips with AI capabilities, but AMD is the first to bring that to the desktop. AMD is launching the first AI PC desktop chip at CES 2024. (AMD) (AMD)\n\nWhat exactly that does for consumers, though, is still largely up in the air. Sure, there are a handful of programs that take advantage of the neural engines available in AI PCs, but chipmakers are depending on developers to pump out a swath of applications that put their NPUs to the test.\n\nAccording to chipmakers, using an onboard NPU means that you’ll be able to run generative AI applications on your device rather than in the cloud. That should mean that your data will stay secured on your own system, rather than having to send it to a third-party company’s servers where it could also be used to train that firm’s AI systems.\n\nCloud-based AI services can also require fees to process some requests, something that onboard AI programs won’t.\n\nIt’s not just chipmakers, either. Ahead of CES, Microsoft (MSFT) announced that it and its PC partners are bringing dedicated Copilot buttons to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards. The first major change to the Windows keyboard in three decades, the Copilot button will call up Windows’ built-in Copilot AI assistant.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to the Ryzen 8000 series’ NPU, AMD says the chip also packs the world’s fastest integrated desktop graphics processor. That means you’ll be able to play games like “Cyberpunk 2077” and “Far Cry 6” at frame rates of more than 60 frames per second. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe caveat here, though, is that you’ll have to opt for the high-end Ryzen 7 8700G version of the chip with a built-in Radeon 780M GPU and set the games’ performance to low with a resolution of 1080p.\n\nIf you’re a serious gamer, you’re still going to want to purchase a separate, dedicated graphics card. But the fact that you can even run those games on an integrated GPU is still impressive.\n\nThe new chips are also another shot at rival Intel as that company navigates its turnaround efforts and attempts to gain back market share it’s lost to AMD.\n\nShares of AMD have jumped 122% over the last 12 months as of the close of trading on Friday. Intel's stock price has climbed just 70% over the same period. Neither chipmaker, however, can touch Nvidia's (NVDA) performance. That company's shares have rocketed 244% over the last year.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable.\n\nTechnology stocks, especially the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, absolutely rocked in 2023 thanks to the AI-fueled rally. While the enthusiasm around AI is just getting started, many analysts believe in 2024 the broader market gains enjoyed by tech stocks last year will expand to other sectors while mega-cap tech stocks will take a back seat. Delano Saporu, Founder and CEO of New Street Advisors Group, while talking to CNBC earlier this month said that Magnificent Seven stocks are expected to take a breather in 2024 while market gains will broaden out to other sectors.\n\nRecently, Jim Cramer also talked about his forecasts for 2024 and said that there is a market rotation going on right now in which money managers are taking profits by selling major technology stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and investing this money into other sectors like financials, healthcare and small-cap companies which remained on the back burner in 2023.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, also thinks that Magnificent Seven stocks are not expected to always outperform and investors should look beyond these stocks in 2024. Discussing his portfolio performance on CNBC, Katz said over the past two years Magnificent Seven stocks on average are up just about 8%. He said that for 2024 he’s expecting the laggards of 2023 to “catch up.”\n\nIn this backdrop, it’s important to take a look at some of the top non-tech stocks that have been posting high revenue growth over the past few months and years. High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify profitable non-tech companies with about 20%+ quarter-over-quarter revenue growth recently and over 20% revenue growth over the past five years. From these companies we selected 17 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n17. Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 11\n\nCanadian banking company Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) is a stock with decent revenue growth over the past few years.\n\nIn November, Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) posted Q4 results. Revenue in the period jumped 8.9% year over year.\n\n16. HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nWith 38 hedge funds having stakes in it, Indian banking company HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB) ranks 16th  in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.\n\nRecently, UBS published its list of top global stock picks for 2024. HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB) made it to the list. UBS said lower rates and “resilient earnings” are expected to help global equities in 2024.\n\n15. Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nTexas-based Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) is one of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 39 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW). The most significant stakeholder of Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) during this period was Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management which owns an $82 million stake in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW).\n\nMany analysts believe small- and mid-cap stocks like TDW are headed for a rebound in 2024 while mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will take a breather.\n\nThird Avenue Small-Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Finally, long-time holding, offshore oil services company, Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) rose 31% in the quarter, as more investors and operators recognized the importance of investing in fossil fuels to sustain long-term economic growth and national security. In a challenging environment for most asset classes, Energy was a considerable outperformer this past quarter, illustrating the potency of the investor pivot.”\n\n14. Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nEntertainment company Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) shares have gained about 23% over the past six months. In December, Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) received several upgrades and bullish comments from Wall Street firms. Among the Wall Street firms bullish on the stock is Morgan Stanley, whose analyst Cameron Mansson-Perrone said the stock’s valuation is attractive. The analyst said Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) has lagged the market by 2,000 basis points since the end of 2021 despite return on capital improvements.\n\nA total of 40 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) as of the end of the September quarter.\n\nBaron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Liberty Media Corporation-Liberty Live is a tracking stock created on 8/4/2023 representing Liberty Media Corporation’s holdings in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”\n\n13. Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nInsurance company Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR) ranks 13th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors. In November Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $8.33, beating estimates by $2.21. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 42.6% year over year to $1.84 million, beating estimates by $40 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR).\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR), a provider of reinsurance and insurance products, surged ahead by 6%. Its second quarter numbers were solid across underwriting, property catastrophe premiums, investment income, and fee income. While there was an impact from severe storms during the quarter, RenRe’s losses were modest.”\n\n12. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nIn December, Goldman Sachs published a list of high-growth stocks that it believes have attractive valuations.

Shaw’s D E Shaw which owns a $443 million stake.\n\nAriel Fund made the following comment about Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Several stocks in the portfolio had strong returns over the period. Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), was one of the top 3 performers in the S&P 500 during the quarter. Shares surged following a significant top- and bottom-line earnings beat, as stronger than anticipated consumer demand is driving a record WAVE season. Forward booking trends are also ahead of historical ranges at record pricing. These factors combined with further improvement in onboard spend and solid cost containment led management to increase RCL’s full-year 2023 guidance. We believe the revised revenue and earnings outlook lays the foundation for RCL to exceed its’ three-year strategic imperative, the Trifecta Program.”\n\n11. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nInsulin delivery systems company Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) 11th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.

Revenue in the period jumped 27% year over year to $432.7 million, beating estimates by $18.5 million.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”\n\n10. Lantheus Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LNTH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nHealthcare company Lantheus Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LNTH) ranks 10th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:LNTH) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also made an investment in Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNTH), which offers a portfolio of diagnostic health care products, primarily serving the complex nuclear imaging market. The company also has a pipeline of disruptive nuclear therapeutics (radiopharmaceuticals), creating a unique combination of strong profitability and cash flow generation with attractive growth opportunities in pipeline and existing products. The operational and logistical challenges of operating in nuclear medicine provide Lantheus a durable moat in this emerging therapeutic market.”\n\n9. Everest Group Ltd (NYSE:EG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nManagement consulting company Everest Group Ltd (NYSE:EG) was one of the stocks in the list of high-growth stocks trading at attractive valuations published by Goldman Sachs’ U.S. Weekly Kickstart in December.  Goldman Sachs said these stocks are suitable for those looking for high growth but are “wary” of valuations.\n\n8. First Citizens BancShares Inc (Delaware) Class A (NASDAQ:FCNCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nFirst Citizens BancShares Inc’s (Delaware) Class A (NASDAQ:FCNCA) revenue in the third quarter increased by a whopping 111% on a YoY basis.

(NASDAQ:FCNCA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s largest position is First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) (“First Citizens” or “FCNCA”). We acquired our stake over the past three years. Initially, we owned and traded around a small position in CIT Group Inc. (“CIT”) during the summer of 2020. We felt CIT was undervalued and management was making progress in reducing risk during the Covid-19 pandemic. In late 2020, CIT agreed to be acquired by First Citizens. We added to our CIT stake the morning of the acquisition announcement because we thought the acquisition was so financially attractive that First Citizens’ shares would rally and pull CIT’s shares higher. Our CIT shares were exchanged for First Citizens shares when the merger completed. We held onto our First Citizens shares because we admired the management team, we felt the bank was undervalued, and we projected the bank would benefit from higher interest rates. Then, earlier this year, First Citizens was the winning bidder in the FDIC’s auction of the failed Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). We added significantly to the Fund’s First Citizens position on the following Monday morning because the deal was unbelievably favorable for First Citizens.\n\nFirst Citizens’s stock price rose more than 50% that day and has risen another 40% in the months since the SVB acquisition.

        "content": "Let’s face it – not everyone wants to research individual stocks. That’s why index-tracking exchange traded funds can be so useful. Among the most popular ETFs is the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), which includes some of the best-known names in technology. Is QQQ stock right for you, though?\n\nIt probably deserves a place in your portfolio, even if you’re an experienced stock picker. The Invesco QQQ ETF, which is managed by Georgia-based fund manager Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), has something to offer to a broad variety of investors. So, let’s crack open this famous fund and see what’s inside.\n\nQQQ Stock: Cheap, Easy and Hard to Beat\n\nWhether you already picked out some technology stocks or not, you can get easy, immediate exposure to some of 2023’s biggest winners with QQQ stock. Furthermore, you can let Invesco’s fund managers do the heavy lifting for a very reasonable fee.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, the total annual expense ratio for the Invesco QQQ ETF is just 0.2%. Compared to the expense ratios of some other funds out there on the market, 0.2% is fairly cheap.\n\nJust to recap, QQQ stock tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. But here’s a fun fact: The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 actually has 101 holdings. Still, it does a good job of tracking (i.e., following) the Nasdaq 100 index, which is technology-sector-dominated and weighted by market capitalization.\n\nAnd by the way, passive income investors should be interested to know that the Invesco QQQ ETF has a 12-month distribution rate (dividend yield plus interest payments) of 0.62%. That’s in addition to the share-price appreciation, which was considerable in 2023. Impressively, the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 share price increased by around 54% last year.\n\nDon’t Fight the Fed! Just Buy the Invesco QQQ ETF.\n\nMoreover, QQQ stock includes some “Magnificent Seven” names that performed exceptionally well in 2023. Here are a few of them, along with their share-price increases from last year:\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA): Up 239% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META): Up 194% Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA): Up 102% Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): Up 81%\n\nThus, you were in the winner’s circle in 2023 if you just held the Invesco QQQ ETF all year long. This year’s best tech-sector performers might be different, but with Invesco’s diversified Nasdaq-100-tracking ETF, you don’t have to play the difficult game of picking and predicting.\n\nBesides, technology stocks tend to perform well when U.S. monetary policy is easing. That will likely occur in 2024, as the market expects the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates multiple times. This would reduce borrowing costs, and should provide a favorable growth environment for companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms.\n\nCatch the Wave of Momentum With QQQ Stock\n\nWhich famous technology stocks will be 2024’s biggest winners? Put away your crystal ball, as you don’t need to pick and predict if you own some QQQ stock.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll certainly want to have some well-known tech names in your portfolio when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. So, whether or not you’re a seasoned stock picker, keep some shares of the Invesco QQQ ETF for the rest of 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the 13 most advanced countries in electronics. You can skip our detailed analysis of the electronics industry and go directly to the 5 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics.\n\nLiving in a technological era, we are constantly surrounded by one or the other form of electronics. Most of us carry one or another form of electronics everywhere we go, short of bushcrafting in the woods, but you'll most likely still take your phone along there too. All these instruments, including smartphones, smart watches, airpods, tabs and PCs, along with others, are the various types of electronics without which, civilization, as we know it, would not exist.\n\nFurthermore, the industry of electronics is continuously evolving and bringing to the forefront innovative products aimed at facilitating a more efficient lifestyle. For the year 2024, it is expected that the electronics industry would show a trend towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well as organic electronics, apart from many more. We have already emphasized the far-reaching role of specialized chips for this sector in the article 12 most advanced countries in electronics. Here we present to you the significance of organic electronics and AI in general.\n\nOrganic Electronics\n\nThe rising global warming and climatic disruption witnessed by the world has encouraged a more environmental friendly attitude. The electronics industry is no different. In an attempt to play their part, sustainable and eco-friendly devices are not only becoming their priority but have also been forecasted as the future of electronics industry. As a means of producing next-generation electronic devices, organic electronics are poised for an accelerated future growth. The global organic electronics market is expected to generate $178.25 billion by 2028.\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) shows full commitment towards sustainability and green initiatives. Cisco Takeback and Reuse, for one, is an effort to support circular economy by efficiently managing end-of-life of returned equipment and enhancing recycling and reuse rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithin this field of organic electronics, OLED technologies are expected to shine the most. Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ: OLED), collaborating with PPG, have recently opened an OLED site- organic light emitting diode- in Shannon, Ireland. This will not only give a boost to the global organic market but to make a substantial contribution to the sustainability agenda of the electronics industry.\n\nSimilarly, LG Display (NYSE: LPL) is also in the running for using organic electronics to produce more efficient and user- friendly devices. Their third generation OLED TV panels is one such example. These TV panels are the lowest blue light for now, which makes them more suitable for eye comfort.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nIn almost any field, be that business, medicine or engineering, AI has revolutionized the concept of efficiency. The electronics market has not only grasped the relevance of this technology for current applications but also for the exponential impacts that can be garnered in future technological progress. It is expected that the AI demand would increase by about 40% in the course of five years. Hence, it is not surprising that various electronic companies are continuously upgrading their products and investments in the arena. While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), have already infiltrated the generative AL software market with powerful computer chips like H100 and MI300X respectively, Intel (NASDAQ: INTL) has also ventured forth with new chips including Gaudi3.\n\nSimilarly, IBM (NYSE: IBM) are also in touch with the necessity of upgrading their AI systems. To this end, only this year they have a new data science platform- Watsonx. It is supposed to provide tools for building and organizing AI and arranging all data sources under one platform.\n\nFuture Forecast\n\nAs evidenced in almost all industries, the COVID-19 pandemic had volatile repercussions for consumers and businesses alike. The electronics industry was, thus one of the victims. Lock-downs and closures negatively impacted electronics sales. However, the work from home trend led to a reversal of the situations, increasing demand for items like computers etc.\n\nIn 2022, the global consumer electronics market was valued at $738.75 billion and it is predicted that this figure would change to $1,239.40 billion by the end of 2030. User-friendly Smart devices are likely to lie at the crux of growth amid increasing household sector and governmental support. While the Asian region has produced most electronics manufacturers, Europeans are also in the race to catch up. Below we present a list of the most advanced countries in electronics. 13 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics\n\nHigh angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most advanced countries in electronics, we’ve ranked them based on their electronics-manufacturing infrastructure, technology and research institutes. For this purpose, we’ve gathered data from various sources, including an FDI Intelligence report that evaluated countries’ locations for the quality of R&D in electronics based on infrastructure, talent availability and business environment. We’ve also accounted for the top electronics companies in these countries. After that, we scored each country in their advancement in electronics given all these factors and ranked them in ascending order of advancement.\n\nHere are the 13 most advanced countries in electronics, which are also some of the most technologically advanced nations.\n\n13. Denmark\n\nDenmark is considered as one of the most advanced electronic countries. As a global leader in audio and sound technology as well as robot and drone testing centers to boast, the country is fully immersed in the electronics field.\n\nElectronics are a major player in the exports for Denmark. These mostly include home electronics, industry electronics, devices and components. Bang & Olufsen is a high-end consumer company that manufactures audio products, television sets and telephones. Another Denmark company is Foss that provides high-tech analytical solutions, mainly for agriculture and food industries.\n\nDenmark also invests in research. The Centre for Industrial Electronics in the University of Southern Denmark and Danish Technological Institute are some of the examples.\n\n12. Finland\n\nFinland is a highly technology-oriented country with various innovations like Linux systems attributed to their name. One of the famous global Finnish companies in the sector is Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK), which provides technological devices, software and communications worldwide.\n\nOther prominent Finnish electronics companies include Scanif, a manufacturing partner for industrial customers like Energy & Cleantech, Medtech & Life Science, Automation & Safety, Advanced Consumer Applications, and Connectivity.\n\nIn addition, Finland is also a leading entity in electronics research and innovation. VTT Technical Research Center of Finland Ltd is the largest research and technology company and research center in Finland, focused on conducting applied electronics research. They aim to not mass produce semi-conductors or consumer electronics but rather sensors that need special know-how and materials, manufacturing processes and applications.\n\n11. United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom is known for their innovation in the electronics industry. It is home to a global manufacturer of electronic components and provider of manufacturing services -- TT Electronics. Their electronics are meant to sense, manage power, connect devices for OEMs in Medical, Aerospace, Defence, Automation and Electrification.\n\nUK is also heavily invested in ensuring proper research and contribution to the electronics industry. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) is a UK government agency that supports research in engineering and physical sciences, including electronics.\n\nLondon is ranked 10th top city by FDI Intelligence for quality of research and development in electronics, with a high score of 145.\n\n10. France\n\nWith top-notch electronic companies like Siemens and Samsung operating in the country, it is no wonder that France has been placed on our list of top countries in electronics.\n\nSchneider Electric is a major multinational French company that specializes in energy management and automation in more than 100 countries.\n\nFrance is also actively involved in research for innovative electronics.  For instance, the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) is a leading research organization involved in electronics research. In addition, the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research (IFCPAR) is yet another attempt by the government to establish grounds for international collaboration in advanced areas of Science and Technology.\n\nParis -- with an impressive score of 158 -- is at the ninth top spot in the FDI Intelligence report for top locations of quality R&D in electronics.\n\n9. Turkey\n\nSupporting more than 2000 electronic manufacturers and placed in a geo-strategic position that connects Europe to Asia, it is one of the highly advanced countries in electronics, especially when it comes to drone-electronics. Many international companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTL) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) have their manufacturing units and even headquarters in the country.\n\nSome of the major companies in the Turkish electronics industry include Endel Industrial products, that produces cable harnesses, condensers and dishwasher baskets; Sunny Elektronik, a manufacturing company that provides kitchen appliances, audio systems, tablets, TVs and water treatment solutions; and Arçelik, another leading manufacturer of home appliances and consumer electronics.\n\nThe government agency, Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Council, as well as Turkish National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology, are a testament of the government’s efforts to keep abreast of electronic development and innovation. The FDI Intelligence Report places the capital of Turkey -- Istanbul -- at the 8th ranking with a score of 163.\n\n8. Germany\n\nIn Europe, Germany has stood out as a leading technology hub. More than 80,000 people are employed within the country and more than 70,000 outside. The exports bring in about 51% of the revenue. The country has prominent electronics companies, like Siemens, Bosch, Intel Germany (NASDAQ: INTL) and Phoenix Contact, which are involved in various activities, from the development of semiconductors and circuit boards to the production of consumer electronics and industrial automation systems.\n\nGermany is also home to a number of research institutions and universities that are actively involved in cutting-edge research in electronics, including Research Fab Microelectronics Germany, the Technical University of Munich, the University of Karlsruhe, and the University of Stuttgart. The R&D expenditure, for the year 2018, was recorded above $17 billion.\n\n7.

        "title": "3 stock picks for a shockingly resilient consumer market",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nOne week into 2024, and investors are being hit with several truths.\n\nThe first truth is that Magnificent Seven stocks don't go up every single day (despite what December's action showed...), and the downgrade buzzards on Wall Street lurk.\n\nApple (AAPL) shares are being hammered by analyst downgrades. Tesla (TSLA) is under pressure after meh delivery numbers. Nvidia's (NVDA) stock is treading water following a ginormous year of gains.\n\nAnother truth is this is a market that will remain super sensitive to anything that dents the view that a barrage of interest rate cuts are coming this year. So bulls, root for subpar macroeconomic data if you must.\n\nAnd the last truth is that the US consumer hasn't fallen apart, and is unlikely to do so in the first half of 2024. I mean, how else can one interpret the eye-popping December jobs report from Friday?\n\nThe labor market added 216,000 jobs in December, up from 173,000 in November. Economists had expected 175,000 for the month.\n\nThe US economy created 2.7 million new jobs in 2023. Unemployment is plumbing record lows. Wages are still rising.\n\n\"The economic backdrop is solid and provides a strong cushion for continued consumer spending,\" LPL chief global strategist Quincy Krosby told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nHow do you play this shocking resilience from an investing standpoint?\n\nExperts are signaling to stick with the consumer winners of last year.\n\nLooked at another way, pay up to own stocks of companies gaining clear market share or benefiting from economic and societal tailwinds.\n\nOne of my favorite retail analysts, Matt Boss over at JP Morgan, just lifted his same-store sales estimates on Lululemon (LULU), a name he has been bullish on. The company continues to dominate the athleisure space with extra high-quality offerings that are commanding ever premium prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoss also upped his profit estimates on Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF). I can't say I am surprised — the company had a massive third quarter of sales, and probably did so again during the holidays. The brand is once again the go-to destination for sub-30 year olds.\n\nMore on why in my chat with Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz in the above episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way.\n\nElsewhere, analysts that cover Costco (COST) such as Jefferies's Corey Tarlowe struck very bullish tones upon receiving Costco's December sales results late last week. Costco posted a December same-store sales increase of 8.1%, with growth in all product categories.\n\n\"We see prospects for Costco to deliver comparable sales 1-2 percentage points above historical levels based on: 1) channel shift from traditional grocery, department stores, and specialty retail; 2) higher growth among Gen Y/Z demos with stronger skew toward club offerings; and 3) bigger baskets as customers increasingly shop categories beyond food,\" Tarlowe wrote.\n\nI suspect good news from many retailers — reflecting consumer resilience — will be on display this week at the ICR conference in Florida. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma will be there all week reporting, so give her a follow on X.\n\nThat said, not everything is perfect in consumer land — something acknowledged in Boss's research.\n\n\"Digging deeper by demographic — excluding the $80 billion incremental COLA benefit (which impacts individuals aged 62 or over), our wallet analysis points to a $16 billion headwind on consumer spending for individuals under the age of 62 comprised of a $45 billion headwind from student loan repayment, $21 billion headwind from reduction in SNAP benefits, and $2 billion drag from tax refunds partially offset by a $51 billion tailwind from lower gas prices,\" Boss notes.\n\nBut overall, the consumer has wind at its back. It's worth doing a little bit of shopping for your portfolio in the new year.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter/X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Despite economic uncertainty, Wall Street delivered phenomenal returns to patient investors in 2023. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite rallied 24% and 43%, respectively, by the time the curtain closed.\n\nAlthough the rally became a bit more broad-based in the final two months of the year, the outperformance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is widely credited with lifting the broader market higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to what have consistently been the seven largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. by market cap:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nApple clocked in as the \"worst\" of the bunch with a 48% return in 2023, while Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia rallied 102%, 194%, and 239%, respectively. AAPL Chart\n\nWhat investors seem to appreciate about the Magnificent Seven stocks is their undeniable competitive advantages.\n\nApple's iPhone is responsible for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share, and its share repurchase program is unmatched by other public companies. Microsoft's Windows is still the undisputed leader in desktop operating systems, while Azure has gobbled up a 25% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Alphabet's Google accounted for close to 92% of worldwide internet search share in December. Meanwhile, streaming platform YouTube (also owned by Alphabet) attracts more than 2.7 billion unique viewers each month. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brings in an estimated 40% of U.S. online retail sales, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) leading the world in cloud infrastructure service spending share (31%), as of the third quarter. Nvidia is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nvidia may account for more than 90% of all graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers in 2024. Meta Platforms owns the world's top social media \"real estate.\" Facebook is the most-visited site globally, with WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger collectively (with Facebook) attracting close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's comfortably reached recurring profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn spite of these competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven stocks could differ dramatically in the new year. Whereas one Magnificent Seven stock is effectively cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company, another expensive highflier appears poised for a reality check.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in 2024: Amazon\n\nAmong the seven industry titans listed above, the one investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024, and likely hold for many years to come, is e-commerce company Amazon.\n\nThe biggest potential headwind for Amazon in the new year is the possibility of a U.S. recession taking shape. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggest a downturn is likely. Since Amazon generates so much of its revenue from its online marketplace, a recession would be expected to slow consumer spending.\n\nBut there are two important things to understand about this headwind for Amazon. First, recessions are historically short-lived. Only three of 12 U.S. recessions following World War II have surpassed 12 months, and none have made it past 18 months. Betting on economic expansion has always been a winning move for patient investors.\n\nSecondly, but most important, Amazon generates very little of its operating cash flow and operating income from its mammoth online marketplace. Even if online retail sales were to taper a bit, it would likely have a negligible impact on the company's cash flow and bottom line.\n\nWhat can carry Amazon's stock to new highs in 2024 is the company's high-growth ancillary operating segments, which are led by AWS.\n\nAs noted, AWS accounts for nearly a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending. Cloud service margins can run circles around the razor-thin margins associated with online retail sales. As a result, AWS is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income despite generating only a sixth of the company's net sales. With enterprise cloud-service spending still ramping up, AWS looks to have a long runway of double-digit growth ahead of it.\n\nDon't overlook Amazon's advertising services segment, either. This is a company that's drawing more than 2 billion people to its site on a monthly basis, many of which are motivated shoppers. This puts the ball in Amazon's court when it comes to ad-pricing power. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered at least 21% year-over-year constant-currency sales growth over the past eight quarters (two years).\n\nAlthough some fundamentally focused investors are going to be turned off by Amazon's astronomical trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 75, the traditional P/E ratio is a terrible way to value cutting-edge companies like Amazon that are reinvesting the bulk of their operating cash flow back into their business. Valuing Amazon relative to its cash flow is, therefore, a much smarter approach.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Amazon was regularly valued at a multiple of 23 to 37 times cash flow. It can be scooped up right now for less than 13 times forecast cash flow in 2024. With the exception of the 2022 bear market, it's the cheapest Amazon has traded, relative to its future cash flow, since going public in 1997. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Nvidia\n\nOn the other side of the coin, semiconductor giant Nvidia has all the hallmarks of a stock to avoid like the plague in 2024.\n\nI'll absolutely give Nvidia credit where credit is due for more than tripling in value last year. With interest in AI soaring, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs quickly became staples in AI-accelerated data centers. Considering that chip fabrication juggernaut Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is significantly beefing up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble delivering more of its AI-driven GPUs in the quarters to come.\n\nSo, what's the problem? Pricing power, growing competition, regulatory headwinds, and history all come to mind.\n\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ends later this month, the company's sales are expected to climb by approximately 119% from the previous year. Almost the entirety of this growth can be traced to the company's GPUs from its data-center segment. More specifically, it's being driven by jaw-dropping pricing power.\n\nThrough the first six months of fiscal 2024, Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined from the prior-year period. Through the first nine months, it's only jumped by an aggregate of 20%. What this tells investors is that A100 and H100 scarcity is what's driven Nvidia's sales growth. Ironically, ramping up its own production in the current calendar year is liable to sap its pricing power and adversely impact its gross margin.\n\nTo build on this point, competition in AI-focused GPUs is bound to pick up. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to roll it out in a big way throughout 2024. Likewise, Intel plans to bring its Falcon Shores GPU to market as a direct competitor to Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips in 2025. This should provide further downside pressure on Nvidia's pricing power.\n\nRegulators are doing Nvidia no favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have imposed restrictions on AI-GPU exports to China. This is a potentially big blow to Nvidia, which regularly generates between 20% and 25% of its sales from the world's No. 2 global economy by gross domestic product.\n\nLastly, history could be Nvidia's worst enemy in the new year. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years that's avoided an initial bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have a tendency to overestimate the adoption/uptake of new innovations without giving them the proper time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to the rule, which could sink Nvidia's proverbial ship in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) — US chipmaker Nvidia plans to begin mass production in the second quarter of 2024 of an artificial intelligence (AI) chip it designed for China to comply with US export rules, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n\nThe H20 chip is the most powerful of three China-focused chips Nvidia developed to meet restrictions announced in October.\n\nIt was originally scheduled for launch last November but that plan was delayed, with sources telling Reuters at the time that the delay was due to issues server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip.\n\nOne of the people said initial production volume will be limited, with Nvidia set to primarily fulfil orders for major customers.\n\nBoth people declined to be identified as the information was confidential. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nReuters previously reported, citing sources, that Chinese companies are reluctant to buy the downgraded H20 and are testing domestic alternatives amid fear the U.S. could again tighten restrictions. Last year, search engine leader Baidu ordered AI chips from Huawei Technologies in a shift away from Nvidia, Reuters reported.\n\nIn addition to the H20, Nvidia plans two other chips that comply with the new restrictions — the L20 and L2. The chipmaker has yet to announce the sale of any of the three.\n\nIn late December, it launched a modified version of an advanced gaming chip designed to comply with the new rules.\n\nNvidia is betting on the chips to help preserve its market share in the country after tightening U.S. export restrictions barred it from shipping products including its advanced A800 and H800 AI chips. Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Adam Selipsky and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang announce an expanded generative AI collaboration in November. (Noah Berger/ Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) (Noah Berger via Getty Images)\n\nThe A800 and H800 themselves were introduced as alternatives for Chinese customers in November 2022 about a month after the U.S. first restricted exports of advanced microchips and equipment to China.\n\nThe H20, L20 and L2 include most of Nvidia's newest features for AI work but with computing power cut back to comply with the new rules, according to SemiAnalysis' analysis of the chips' specifications.\n\n(Reporting by Yelin Mo in Beijing and Fanny Potkin in Singapore; Editing by Brenda Goh and Christopher Cushing)",

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its “ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy” fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. For both the quarter and the whole year, the Strategy exceeded the benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index, supported by robust Magnificent Seven stock selection, opportunistic management of earnings reset names, and diverse non-tech contributions. The Strategy posted gains across 10 out of the eleven sectors in which it was invested, on an absolute basis. Overall stock selection contributed to performance on a relative basis. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy featured stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. On January 5, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $490.97 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 5.30%, and its shares gained 214.16% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $1.213 trillion.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\n\n\"Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those three stocks, as well as Microsoft, were among the leading contributors to Strategy performance for the quarter. Microsoft and Nvidia continued to be supported by strong execution and leadership positions in the implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThese are high-quality, cash flow generative businesses that we will continue to own, actively adjusting our positioning sizes based on risk/reward and portfolio construction priorities. With Nvidia shares more than tripling in 2023, we opportunistically took profits throughout the year, an approach that continued in the fourth quarter with additional trims that brought the position down to 6% of overall assets.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.\"\n\nStory continues Nvidia, Software\n\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in fifth position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer recently said in a program that the time has come for investors to take some profits on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks as the market begins to undergo a rotation. Cramer said “it’s a new market” in 2024 and financial, healthcare and small-cap stocks which were put on the backburner by the Street amid recession fears are now in the spotlight. Cramer said that the market is favoring “boring” stocks with high yields as investors believe recession fears have been managed by the Federal Reserve and rates are expected to come down.\n\nCramer said long-term interest rates peaked in October 2023 and since then high-yield dividend stocks have been “flying\" while Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their leadership position when it comes to stock market gains. Cramer said that during most of 2023 Magnificent Seven stocks, which include major companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), among other tech leaders, led the stock market gains. But after October 2023, things have changed. Cramer shared a chart which showed S&P 500 performance trends on an equal-weighted basis. Data shows that an equal-weighted S&P 500 has beaten the Magnificent Seven index by 13.4% from October 2023 through January 3, 2024.\n\nJim Cramer said that “all sorts of stocks” are now showing strong performance and gains are no longer limited to the seven major tech stocks. Cramer mentioned some major banks and said financial stocks have been among the top performers in the current environment.\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted that there’s a broader money rotation going on in the market right now, with major tech stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Tesla acting as “sources of funds.” That means money managers are taking profits from these stocks and putting these funds into other companies that have hitherto been ignored amid the macro economic backdrop.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article we decided to evaluate the performance of Jim Cramer’s predictions and analysis. Back in September we covered some stocks Jim Cramer was recommending investors to sell. In this article we took a look at the performance of those stocks to see whether Cramer’s predictions and sell calls were right or wrong. For each stock we mentioned its performance over the past few months and the reasons behind Cramer’s bearish outlook on these companies.\n\nThe list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in these companies. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks: How Did They Perform?\n\n12. Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 2\n\nJim Cramer called Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) a “mess” in 2023 and said he was unable to understand how Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) makes money. Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) shares have plummeted about 39% over the past six months. Problems started for Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) last year after a short report from Hindenburg Research accused the company of overstating asset values.\n\nJust two hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 funds had stakes in Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nLast year Cramer remained bullish on quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and kept recommending investors to stay away from money-losing stocks.\n\n11. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 11\n\nBack in August 2023, Jim Cramer said that investing in spacecraft company Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) was akin to “sending your money up in smoke.” Over the past six months the stock has lost about 7% in value. However, December 2023 was a great month for Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) as it announced multiple positive news. The US government awarded Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) a $515 million contract to design, manufacture, deliver, and operate 18 space vehicles.  Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) also successfully launched its 42nd Electron rocket and deployed a satellite for Japan-based Earth imaging company the Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space.\n\n10. Telus Corp (NYSE:TU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nJim Cramer in August 2023 called the Canadian telecom company Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) a “loser” as the analyst believes there are multiple companies in the market doing the same thing as Telus Corp (NYSE:TU).\n\nOver the past six months, Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) shares have lost about 9% in value. In November, Telus Corp (NYSE:TU) upped its quarterly dividend by 3.4%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Telus Corp (NYSE:TU).\n\n9. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nBitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) ranks 9th in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was recommending selling last year. In November 2023, Jim Cramer said the following about the company:\n\n“They don’t make any money...If you want to do Bitcoin, own Bitcoin.”\n\nOver the past six months, Riot Platforms shares have gained about 16%.\n\nEarlier this month, the company said it produced 619 bitcoins in December 2023, a 12% increase month over month and a 9% decline on a yearly basis.\n\n8. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nLast year, when asked about his thoughts on solid state lithium metal battery company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS), Jim Cramer made a “hard pass” on the stock and said “there’s nothing there” about Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The stock has lost about 6.6% over the past six months.\n\nInsider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 20 hedge funds had stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The biggest stakeholder of Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) during this period was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $40 million stake in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS).\n\nThe company in its Q3 earnings call talked about its business performance and guidance:\n\n\"Despite these changes in the timing of CapEx, we continue to target low-volume B samples in 2024 and higher-volume B samples in 2025. During Q3, our CapEx primarily went toward facility and equipment spend for our consolidated QS-0 pre-pilot line, including for our Raptor process. For the remainder of the year, our CapEx will continue to be predominantly allocated toward QS-0. During the quarter, we raised $300 million in gross proceeds from our public follow-on offering. We ended Q3 with over $1.1 billion in liquidity and continue to look for opportunities to optimize our spending and be prudent with our strong balance sheet.\n\nWe now forecast our cash runway will extend into 2026. Any additional funds raised from capital markets activity, including under our ATM prospectus supplement, would further extend this cash runway. Longer term, our capital requirements will be a function of our industrialization business model, which we believe could reflect a mix of wholly owned production, joint venture, and licensing relationships. With that, I’ll hand things over to Jagdeep for a final word on our strategic outlook.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n7. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nIn December 2022, Jim Cramer said the following about EV company Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID):\n\n“We don’t want to fool around with that. The thing just goes down and down. I see a trend. ... I think that one is just too dangerous.”\n\nFast forward to June 2023, Cramer’s thoughts about Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) hadn’t budged as he said, while answering a call about Rivian Automotive, that investors should sell Rivian and Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) because they were money-losing companies.\n\nJim Cramer has been right about the stock since Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) shares have gone nowhere but down. Over the past six months Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) stock lost about 47% in value.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID).\n\n6. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nIn August 2023, Jim Cramer said Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) investors should take profits should the stock bounce back since Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) has “disappointed” for so long.\n\nIn December 2023, Jim Cramer said that he was “pulling the plug” on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) and Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) is now a “no go” for him.\n\nPlug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares have lost about 58% over the past six months.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 26 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). The most significant stakeholder of the firm during this period is Israel Englander’s Millennium Management which owns a $26 million stake in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG).\n\nWhile PLUG is a sell according to Cramer, throughout 2023, he remained bullish on tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe company talked about its Q4 guidance in its Q3 earnings call:\n\nIn the fourth quarter, we anticipate the revenue from our new ventures will surpass revenue from our traditional business for the first time as our electrolyzers and cryogenic businesses continue to grow. Finally, I’d like to just like to reflect on the conversation I had yesterday morning with a European customer supplier and partner. He gets toward our facilities and remind me that no one has built hydrogen infrastructure on the scale we have. No one has our product set, no one has technical talent, no one has our customer relationships and no one has our real life experiences. It remains our belief and his there is the market for hydrogen fuel cell grows, no one is in a better position than Plug to take advantage of this opportunity. This is just a bump on the road.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires 13 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now George Soros and Jim Cramer Love These Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Two major 2023 beneficiaries downgraded",
        "content": "Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analsyt comments.\n\nGoldman sees more outperformance from AI beneficiaries\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts are out with their 2024 outlook for IT Hardware and networking equipment providers. In essence, they argue that AI beneficiaries should continue to outperform in 2024.\n\nTop Picks in this regard include Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), which is expected to continue benefiting from accelerating capex growth at its key hyperscale customers (Microsoft and Meta) and milestones that support Ethernet as an AI networking fabric.\n\nMoreover, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) is also flagged as a company that should see growing demand for AI servers as “infrastructure investments expand beyond hyperscalers (first movers) to AI cloud service providers and eventually enterprise.”\n\nMixed comments on Nvidia\n\nBank of America analysts maintained NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a Top Pick in the chip sector and highlighted that the company’s “genAI dominance can potentially help generate ~ $100bn of incremental free cash flow over the next two years (CY24/CY25E).”\n\n“In our view NVDA’s solid FCF generation creates optionality in addressing these concerns, and in helping to expand its trading multiple back to its historical median 35x-40x,” the analysts said.\n\nOn the other hand, DA Davidson analysts initiated research coverage on NVDA stock with a Neutral rating and a $410 per share price target.\n\n“While we continue to believe that generative AI is the most important transformative technology since the Internet, we do not expect the same level of investment we saw in 2023 continuing beyond 2024,” analysts said in a note.\n\nMorgan Stanley discusses AI regulation\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley shared key takeaways following their conversation with experts from Stanford University on AI regulation.\n\n“We continue to believe that the development and implementation of AI regulation in the US will not be imminent and discuss multiple hurdles to clear,” analysts wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, analysts argue that development and implementation of AI regulation in the United States is still in the early innings and that it will “take years to implement anything enforceable in the United States.”\n\n“The experts cited resource constraints at the Federal agency level and asymmetrical information between government and industry as two key factors that could hinder successful AI regulation.”\n\n2023 AI beneficiaries cut\n\nTwo major AI beneficiaries from 2023, MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), saw their ratings cut this week. The former was downgraded at UBS after a 108% rally in 2023.\n\n“We still like the durable ~30% long-term growth story, but absent a material database revs pull-through from AI workloads in 2024, we conclude that a continued re-rating of the stock is unlikely,” UBS analysts said on MDB.\n\nElsewhere, Palantir is 'overhyped on AI' and therefore Jefferies analysts downgraded it to Neutral.\n\n“We are concerned that the stock has rallied to unsustainable valuation levels primarily on the back of AI euphoria (and retail trading momentum) with no monetization strategy,” the analyst said in a note.\n\n“We are still fundamental fans and believe that the company has potential to gain share in an underpenetrated and large TAM but believe that there is more risk than reward at current levels, even when factoring in upward estimate revisions.”\n\nUiPath gets a new bull\n\nWilliam Blair analysts initiated research coverage on pure AI name UiPath (NYSE: NYSE:PATH) with an Outperform rating.\n\n“We believe that UiPath is a leader in the workflow automation and process optimization markets. The company’s platform helps automate manual workflows through user interface (UI) and application programming interface (API)-based automations,” analysts wrote.\n\n“UiPath addresses complex and enterprise-grade processes, which has led to the company’s platform becoming mission critical for its customers (as evidenced by its strong gross retention rate of 97%).”\n\nAll in all, analysts see PATH delivering “durable growth and expanding margins over the next few years.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Two major 2023 beneficiaries downgraded\n\nAudacy cuts debt by 80% in prepackaged bankruptcy plan\n\nAvalon Pharma sets IPO on Tadawul with up to 6 million shares",

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: 1 Superb Stock-Split Stock to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "What a difference a year makes. After the Nasdaq Composite shed 33% of its value in 2022 -- one of the worst market performances in over a decade -- the index has nearly returned to its former glory, closing the door on 2023 with a gain of 43%.\n\nHistory offers a hint about what could be ahead in the coming year. Since it first began trading in 1972, in every year that followed a bear-market rebound, the tech-heavy index has continued to rally, gaining 19% on average. While there are no guarantees in investing, this suggests the current recovery has more room to run.\n\nOne strategy investors use to find winning stocks is to look at companies that have conducted stock splits in recent years, as those moves are historically preceded by years of robust gains. One such company is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Over the past decade, the stock has generated total returns of 12,780%, resulting in a 4-for-1 stock split in mid-2021.\n\nThe chipmaker logged gains of 239% last year, which has some investors concerned about its valuation. However, a little digging will unearth evidence that the stock is cheaper than it might by some measures appear. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI catalyst\n\nRecent advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have been a boon for Nvidia. More specifically, generative AI went viral last year, and these algorithms have been applied to a wide variety of mundane, time-consuming tasks, resulting in greater productivity. Increased efficiency generally results in greater profits, and businesses have been scrambling to integrate AI models into their operations to benefit from the expected windfalls.\n\nSo why does this matter to Nvidia? In short, the company produces the gold standard of graphics processing units (GPUs), which can not only provide the computing power necessary to render lifelike images in video games but can also supply the computational horsepower necessary to support AI systems. This is all possible because of parallel processing, which takes computationally intensive jobs and breaks them down into smaller, more manageable chunks, allowing GPUs to conduct a multitude of complex mathematical calculations simultaneously.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, Nvidia processors have been deployed in a wide range of applications, including cloud computing and data centers, which will act as hubs for many AI systems.\n\nThe accelerating adoption of AI will play to Nvidia's strengths, and while estimates vary greatly, there is general agreement that the opportunity is staggering. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the generative AI market will grow from $40 billion in 2022 to $1.3 trillion by 2032, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42%.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding\n\nA quick look at Nvidia's recent results helps illustrate the potential wrought by AI. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), Nvidia's revenue grew 206% year over year to $18.1 billion -- a company record -- while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 1,274% to $3.71. Those percentages were partially skewed by easy comps resulting from 2022's tech sector slowdown, but help illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity.\n\nInvestors shouldn't expect the company's triple- and quadruple-digit gains to continue over the long term, but its ongoing growth should be robust nonetheless. For its fiscal fourth quarter, now underway, management is forecasting more record results, including revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be an increase of 230% year over year. This shows that the AI opportunity is far from over.\n\nThere's more good news. Nvidia is the undisputed market leader for chips used for machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- controlling an estimated 95% of the market, according to New Street Research.\n\nAs the default provider of processing solutions for AI, Nvidia is well positioned to ride this secular tailwind higher.\n\nThe game's afoot\n\nWhile the prospects of AI are intriguing, Nvidia has several other growth drivers up its sleeve. For example, the recent slump in the gaming market is beginning to turn. The global graphics card market for gaming is expected to grow from $3.65 billion in 2024 to $15.7 billion by 2029, a CAGR of 34%, according to market research firm Mordor Intelligence. As the leading provider of gaming GPUs, this secular tailwind will boost Nvidia as well.\n\nNvidia is also the leading provider of processors used to zip data through the ether and around data centers, with an estimated 95% of that market, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. The digital transformation shows no signs of slowing as companies shift even more workloads and business systems to the cloud, so the data center boom will likely continue. The data center market is expected to grow from $263 billion in 2022 to $603 billion by 2030, a CAGR of roughly 11%, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research.\n\nThis all shows that Nvidia's chips are so much more than just the gold standard for AI -- its products are also the semiconductors of choice for the gaming, cloud computing, and data center markets.\n\nThe 800-pound gorilla of GPUs\n\nAfter Nvidia shares notched gains of more than 200% in 2023, investors are naturally uneasy about its valuation -- but there's a catch.\n\nThe stock is currently selling for 27 times sales and 65 times earnings -- lofty metrics that would seem to validate investor concerns. However, those measurements don't factor in Nvidia's triple-digit percentage growth rate. For a company expanding this rapidly, the more appropriate metric to use is the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which for Nvidia is less than 1 -- the standard for an underpriced stock. For the S&P 500, the PEG ratio is more than 2, which further puts Nvidia's valuation into the proper context.\n\nGiven its dominant position in numerous growth markets, its strong history of growth, and its reasonable valuation, Nvidia is one stock-split stock investors should buy ahead of an expected Nasdaq surge in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The S&P 500 finished 2023 in spectacular fashion. The index notched nine consecutive weekly increases, its longest win streak since 2004. In total, the S&P 500 soared 24% last year as market sentiment improved amid signs of economic resilience.\n\nFour sectors were primarily responsible for driving the market higher. The technology sector gained 56% and the communications services sector climbed 53%, helped along in many cases by excitement surrounding artificial intelligence. Consumer discretionary rose 40% as cooling inflation led to an acceleration in spending. Finally, industrials increased 18% as business investments in structures and equipment rebounded.\n\nNot surprisingly, the 10 best-performing S&P 500 stocks in 2023 came from those four sectors, as detailed below:\n\nNvidia: 239% -- technology Meta Platforms: 194% -- communications services Royal Caribbean: 162% -- consumer discretionary Builders FirstSource: 157% -- industrials Uber: 149% -- industrials Carnival: 133% -- consumer discretionary Advanced Micro Devices: 128% -- technology PulteGroup: 127% -- consumer discretionary Palo Alto Networks: 111% -- technology Tesla: 102% -- consumer discretionary\n\nNine of the stocks listed above have a consensus buy rating among Wall Street analysts (Tesla is the lone exception with a consensus hold rating). But analysts believe Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the single best pick of the bunch in 2024. The stock has a median 12-month price target of $650 per share, implying 37% upside from its share price as of this writing.\n\nCarnival currently ranks second with a 12-month median price target of $21.50 per share, implying 32% upside. And Meta Platforms takes third place with a 12-month median price target of $385 per share, implying 12% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is shaping the artificial intelligence boom\n\nNvidia is an accelerated computing company that provides hardware, software, and services across four end markets: gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Its invention of the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999 brought revolutionary visual effects to video games and films, and the company still holds a 90% market share in workstation graphics processors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Nvidia redefined itself in 2006 when it introduced CUDA, a programming model that allows its GPUs to function as general purpose processors. That innovation helped the company find purchase in data centers, where its GPUs have become the gold standard in accelerating complex workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn fact, Forrester Research has said Nvidia GPUs are synonymous with AI infrastructure, and the company has consistently achieved leading results at the MLPerf benchmarks, which evaluate the training and inference performance of AI hardware, software, and services. That superiority has allowed Nvidia to capture an 80% to 95% market share in machine learning (ML) processors, according to analysts. The company also holds a 95% market share in data center accelerators, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.\n\nNvidia has solidified its position as the gold standard in AI chips by branching into subscription software and cloud services. It recently launched DGX Cloud, which provides on-demand access to supercomputing infrastructure, software, and pretrained ML models that support the development and deployment of AI applications, including generative AI applications. The service also offers frameworks that address specific use cases across different industries, from manufacturing and logistics to retail and cybersecurity.\n\nDGX Cloud is a particularly momentous development because it unifies and democratizes access to Nvidia AI technologies. To quote Argus analyst Jim Kelleher, \"Nvidia stands out, in our view, not only because it participates in so many parts of the dynamic AI economy, but because it has synthesized its offerings into a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service delivered through the cloud.\"\n\nNvidia reported record results in the third quarter\n\nNvidia looked exceptionally strong in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29). Revenue skyrocketed 206% to $18.1 billion on record sales in the data center segment, and non-GAAP net income increased 588% to $10.0 billion as high-margin software and services accounted for more of total revenue.\n\nThe company also reported solid sales growth in gaming and professional visualization, as detailed below:\n\nData center sales soared 279% to $14.5 billion. Gaming sales increased 81% to $2.9 billion. Professional visualization sales jumped 108% to $416 million. Automotive sales ticked up 4% to $261 million.\n\nNvidia currently values its addressable market at $1 trillion, but that figure should explode as more businesses turn to AI in search of productivity gains. Indeed, a report from Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending alone will compound by 42% annually to reach $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nNvidia stock trades at a reasonable price\n\nNvidia is well-positioned to grow its business as AI weaves its way into the fabric of daily life. In fact, the Wall Street consensus calls for the company to increase earnings per share 42% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 63 times earnings easier to stomach. Indeed, given its incredible growth, that multiple looks cheap compared to competing chipmakers and cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nSpecifically, Nvidia's PEG ratio -- the price-to-earnings multiple divided by expected annual earnings growth -- currently sits at 1.5. That is a big discount to semiconductor stocks AMD and Intel, which sport PEG ratios of 35.6 and 3.6, respectively. It's also a discount to cloud providers Amazon and Microsoft, which have PEG ratios of 2.8 and 2.5, respectively.\n\nAs a caveat, 63 times earnings is not cheap, per se. But price-to-earnings multiples must be considered in context. Nvidia is forecast to grow earnings much faster than its peers, so the stock warrants a higher valuation. That said, Nvidia is still a risky investment because the stock could fall sharply if the company fails to meet expectations.\n\nPatient investors should still consider buying a small position today. Shareholders may or may not see the 37% return in 2024 that analysts expect, but Nvidia has become the heart of the current AI boom. That will almost certainly translate into shareholder value over the next five-plus years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "A new year brings new questions for investors looking to find the top stocks for 2024. Will the long-forecast recession be confirmed? If so, how severe will it be? Will the Magnificent 7 continue to be magnificent? Are future earnings already priced into the stock market? What is the Federal Reserve’s thinking on the timing of rate cuts? Is the consumer out of gas?\n\nYou can add your own questions, but you get the idea. This is still a market that offers more questions than answers.\n\nWith that said, you also can expect some surprises. At this time last year, nobody was talking about the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). Now, companies are referencing AI in their earnings reports as never before.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd add to all of that, it’s an election year.\n\nInvestors hate uncertainty and there’s enough to keep them out of the market. But objectively speaking, the market had a great year in 2023 despite all the headwinds it faced. The difference between now and other years is that you have to really focus your efforts on the stocks that are growing earnings.\n\nFortunately, there are stocks to be found in many sectors. While dominate is a strong word, there are several reasons to believe these companies will be among the top stocks for 2024.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou’ll forgive me for starting off this list of top stocks for 2024 with an obvious choice, but Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) still merits your consideration. The company saw explosive growth as demand for its AI chips outpaced the company’s ability to make them.\n\nThat’s not something to completely dismiss. Plus, as Luke Lango wrote recently, many companies are now looking for custom AI chips to support custom applications. That opens the door for other chip makers. Investors will be watching to see how soon those chips are available.\n\nNevertheless, Nvidia still projects earnings growth of more than 65% in the next 12 months. That easily covers a lofty price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat doesn’t mean I’m suggesting investors will get a 240% return on their investment as they did in 2023. But there is still more growth to be found in NVDA stock. This will be particularly true if the company experiences growth in its PC market.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is the market share leader in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips. These are the kind of chips that will be critical for AI applications which are memory hogs. This will be particularly true as companies create custom AI applications.\n\nTo that end, Micron launched its HBM3E memory-chip module in late 2023. The company will begin producing the chips at scale early this year and is forecasting millions of dollars in revenue during this fiscal year.\n\nAs one of the top stocks for 2024, Micron is not without its detractors. Whereas a company like Nvidia gets the benefit of the doubt despite expectations for slowing growth, some analysts are viewing those revenue projections a bit more skeptically. The company does face competition that is eating away at its market share. And macroeconomic uncertainty may affect the company’s growth prospects.\n\nInvestors have to wait until the end of March for Micron’s earnings report. In the meantime, you can look at the analysts’ forecast for 15% growth in MU stock over the next 12 months.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been a polarizing and volatile stock over the past four years. Investors were treated to all-time highs in 2021 and 2022 spurred by demand for its COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics. But 2023 was a different story. PFE stock is down more than 40% in the last 12 months and is trading at levels not seen since 2016.\n\nBut before you dismiss Pfizer, you should at least understand the bullish case, which has nothing to do with its COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines.\n\nThe company has 13 drug candidates in Phase 3 clinical trials. That will go a long way to replacing declining revenue and earnings as sales of its COVID-19 products normalize. In fact, the company expects to see $20 billion in growth from its own pipeline by 2030.\n\nThe company’s full-year earnings forecast for 2024 came in at $2.24 on the high end. That’s lower than the $2.31 that analysts expected, but it still would be a 49% gain in the next 12 months. With a stock that’s trading at 19x earnings, that kind of growth is not priced into the stock.\n\nAnalysts see high single-digit growth for PFE stock in 2024. And with a dividend that currently has a yield of 5.61%, investors can expect Pfizer to be one of the top stocks for 2024.\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) MTCH stock: the Match group logo on a computer screen with a phone displaying its site\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nI found Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) on a list of top-ranked stocks via a stock screener and wanted to see if it would be a match for portfolios in 2024. As it turns out, if you can stomach what may be a short-term correction, this is a stock that could be in for significant gains later in 2024.\n\nA lot of the interest in MTCH stock has to do with Tinder, it’s most recognizable name and a favorite among Gen-Z users. However, my thesis for Match Group hinges (pun intended) on Hinge – one of the dating app brands owned by Match. The company is leaning into AI in an effort to improve on its aim to be the app that was “designed to be deleted.”\n\nIn the company’s most recent earnings report, the company projects 14% earnings growth in the next 12 months and analysts have a consensus upside of 14% for MTCH stock. It was reported that usage levels for Hinge were at an all-time high. It’s now the most downloaded dating app in the U.K and Australia and is in the top three within the United States. All of which supports the company’s goal to reach $400 million in annual revenue.\n\nSelect Medical Group (SEM) Image of a hospital with workers walking in the halls\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUsing the same stock screener that gave me Match Group, I found Select Medical Group (NYSE:SEM). Select Medical employs over 53,000 throughout the United States. The company owns long-term acute care, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, occupational health, and physical therapy clinics.\n\nSEM stock is known for being a dividend payer, but it may have some opportunity for explosive growth in 2024. This may be a case of the market overlooking the company’s solid earnings growth in 2023. In the first three quarters, earnings are up 61% year-over-year. And the company expects earnings growth of 18% in the next 12 months.\n\nStill, as of this writing, the stock is basically flat for the last 12 months. But it’s up 9% in the last month and analysts see a 23% upside for SEM stock. Despite that surge, SEM stock still trades at an appealing 11x forward earnings. Investors looking for a momentum stock to buy should pay close attention as the company moves closer to earnings in February.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Delta airlines aircraft interior full of passengers. Why are so many flights overbooked?\n\nSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother way to find the top stocks for 2024 is to look at stocks that are trading at a historically low P/E ratio. That’s the case with the next two stocks. The first is Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) which continues to be a solid performer as demand for travel continues unabated.\n\nYou shouldn’t expect Delta to deliver 280% earnings growth as it has in the first three quarters of 2023. But the company is still forecasting over 9% growth in the next 12 months. Yet, despite that strong growth the stock is “only” up about 13.5% in the last 12 months.\n\nSome of that is due to expectations for higher jet fuel costs that never materialized. And that could become an issue if the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates earlier than expected.\n\nBut that’s a problem for another day. Right now, investors should look at a forecast for growth that includes a reinstated dividend that has plenty of room to grow in the coming years.\n\nDevon Energy (DVN) An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screen\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of a potential rise in oil prices, another one of the top stocks for 2024 is likely to be Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). Like many oil and gas stocks, DVN stock is down 20% in the last year as crude oil prices fell below $70 a barrel.\n\nThose prices look to be stabilizing as does the price of natural gas. That should allow investors to focus on a company like Devon Energy that continues to increase its reserves.\n\nAnd if the Federal Reserve cuts rates as is widely expected at some point this year, oil prices are likely to go much higher. The thesis is simple. If the Fed cuts rates, it will because the economy is slowing dramatically, or they are expecting it to do so. Given the Fed’s track record, we’ll say they’ll be late rather than early.\n\nThis will be bullish for DVN stock. Renewable energy is here to stay. But getting a trillion-dollar jump started will require a lot of King Oil. And we will continue to need oil for decades to come. So, with Devon Energy projecting nearly 10% earnings growth in the next 12 months, it’s a good time to consider adding DVN stock to your portfolio.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings website in browser with company logo\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) was a superstar performer in 2023 rewarding investors with a gain of over 170%. While the company isn’t likely to pull that kind of growth in 2024, there are still catalysts that are likely to make DKNG stock one of the top stocks for 2024.\n\nConsider that 38 states currently allow sports betting in some fashion. And out of those 38 states, 26 allow sports betting via smartphone apps or websites. In 2024, there are at least two states, Maine and Vermont, that plan to launch sports betting at some point.\n\nIt’s hard to predict when other states will legalize sports betting. But it’s safe to say that the company has done the heavy lifting. And with revenue clearly growing, the company is showing that there are good profit margins in sports betting.\n\nThe company is not profitable yet on an EBITDA basis and it’s not expected to be for at least the next 12 months. But analysts don’t appear to be too concerned about that. The consensus price target for DKNG stock is $40.31 which is 22% higher than the closing price on January 4, 2023.\n\nExpedia Group (EXPE) Expedia app logo on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one of the world’s largest online travel agencies. And despite tough comparisons with 2022, the company has beaten revenue and earnings expectations in the first three quarters of the year. And there’s every expectation that trend will continue when the company reports earnings in early February.\n\nHowever, EXPE stock is up 59% in the last 12 months and at least two institutional investors sold a significant amount of the company’s stock in the third quarter. That may explain, in part, why the stock has started off the trading year down around 4%.\n\nThat’s a nice pullback, and investors may even see the stock go lower. That’s okay because this is one stock you’ll want to play the long game with. Consumers are voting with their wallets. And the winners of their discretionary dollars are travel and experiences. That’s Expedia’s wheelhouse and why it’s fair to presume that the company’s projection for 34% earnings growth in the next 12 months is likely.\n\nIf it is, analysts will quickly bid the stock higher. That’s why you can use any pullback as a reason to buy EXPE stock.\n\nWendy’s (WEN) A photo of a Wendy's chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.\n\nSource: Deutschlandreform / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors have profited by investing in McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock. The company is a dividend aristocrat that continually delivers a solid total return. But at over $180 a share, investors may be looking for a less expensive, yet still profitable alternative.\n\nI offer up Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) for your consideration. Like many companies on this list of top stocks for 2024, Wendy’s has been posting solid top and bottom line growth in the face of difficult comparisons to 2022.\n\nDespite that, WEN stock is down 16.8% in the last 12 months as investors have largely steered clear of what is seen as a discretionary stock. But it may be time to take a closer look. The company is projecting 12% earnings growth and pays a dividend with a yield of over 5%. Analysts have a consensus price target which gives the stock 15% growth in the next year. That makes for an attractive total return.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 2 Top AI Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "2023 was a year of recovery for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which jumped 43% amid the easing of inflation and other macroeconomic challenges that hurt stocks in 2022. But if history is anything to go by, the rally could be just getting started. According to an analysis of data going back to 1971, the index has surged by an average of 19% every year following a bear-market rebound like the one we experienced in 2023.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could make great ways to bet on this pattern repeating itself in 2024 and beyond -- especially as both companies develop their new growth strategies around artificial intelligence (AI) technology.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWith shares up 236% over the last 12 months, Nvidia was one of the Nasdaq's biggest winners in 2023 -- helping drive the index's recovery after its slump in 2022. The tech giant is riding a wave of demand for its data center chips for large language models -- the technology behind AI chatbots. And with these applications becoming increasingly demanding, Nvidia's boom might be just getting started.\n\nWhile 2023 was a breakout year for AI, the technology is still in its nascent stage. As an article in Time noted, the rate at which AI is surpassing humans at various tasks is accelerating, which could unlock new and increasingly complex use cases. Nvidia is at the forefront of this trend because of its industry-leading chips like the H100, sales of which helped power its 206% year-over-year revenue jump to $18.12 billion in the third quarter.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia is not the only game in town. Rival Advanced Micro Devices is racing to capture a slice of the opportunity with new AI chips of its own. But with industry experts projecting the market for that hardware to grow tenfold to $400 billion by 2027, there seems to be plenty of room for more players to get involved without significantly eroding Nvidia's revenue growth and margins.\n\nThe company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24 also means shares are reasonably valued compared to the Nasdaq's average of 29.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nWith a market cap of $1.55 trillion, Amazon is one of the world's largest companies. And this didn't happen by accident. The tech giant's success has hinged on its ability to quickly grow its footprint in new industries -- from e-commerce to cloud computing. Now, AI technologies could help power its next phase of expansion.\n\nAmazon is weaving AI into most aspects of its operations. And this includes product recommendations, fulfillment optimization, and its virtual assistant, Alexa, which is being boosted with new conversational abilities. But the greatest impact will probably be felt in Amazon Web Services (AWS), where it is building a platform for enterprise clients to create and scale their own AI applications.\n\nEmblematic of these efforts was Amazon's announcement in September of its plans to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an AI research start-up similar to ChatGPT creator OpenAI. As part of the deal, Athropic will use AWS cloud services to train and deploy its models, potentially serving as a proof of concept for Amazon's new Trainium and Inferentia AI data center chips, which it designed to be high-performance, low-cost alternatives to third-party hardware.\n\nTrading at a forward P/E ratio of 38, Amazon's stock is more expensive than the average Nasdaq stock. But that premium seems reasonable, considering it is a well-diversified blue-chip company with a long track record of success.\n\nAnother banger year?\n\nNothing is guaranteed in the stock market, but investors have many reasons to be optimistic about 2024. For starters, the high inflation that caused so much trouble over the past two years has largely been reined in, and the Federal Reserve is likely to lower benchmark interest rates this year, making it easier for companies to access the funds they need to maintain and grow their businesses.\n\nThat could be a shot in the arm for AI start-ups, many of which make use of Nvidia and Amazon's enterprise-focused AI solutions. Both tech giants look poised to succeed in 2024 and beyond, and it is not too late for investors to bet on their long-term success.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "If You Invested $10,000 in Nvidia in 2020, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",
        "content": "It's no secret that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) had one of the strongest years of any stock in the market in 2023. With many companies ramping up their purchases of its class-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) for developing artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia's revenue shot through the roof. That boom is far from over, and the stock has already responded to the sales jump incredibly.\n\nIn 2023, the stock rose nearly 240%. That's a magnificent return, but what would have happened if you had held Nvidia for slightly longer than that -- say, starting in 2020? Well, the results and lessons learned might surprise you.\n\nA $10,000 investment has seen a few ups and downs\n\nThe first thing to understand about Nvidia's business is that it is cyclical. Its GPUs are used to run arduous workloads like gaming graphics, engineering simulations, drug discovery, cryptocurrency mining, and creating AI models. The business booms when consumers are flush with cash and companies are willing to invest in their computing capabilities.\n\nBefore the AI gold rush, the previous two Nvidia booms were spurred by cryptocurrency miners. Because GPUs are used to mine digital currencies, many people bought thousands of the company's chips to perform the task. This caused a sales spike in 2018 and 2021.\n\nBut the problem with booms is that they are usually followed by a bust, which is exactly what happened with Nvidia.\n\nWhen the cryptocurrency market collapsed in 2019 and 2022, demand for GPUs evaporated, causing the company to post multiple consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Before the AI competition took off, Nvidia was still dealing with declining GPU sales, but the shot in the arm provided by AI quickly reversed its fortunes.\n\nSo, if you look at how much money you would have made by investing $10,000 in Nvidia at the start of 2020, you would have experienced quite the roller coaster ride. NVDA Chart\n\nIn late 2021 (at the height of the market for many tech stocks and cryptocurrencies), Nvidia had turned a $10,000 investment into more than $50,000. But that figure was down to about $20,000 in just a few short months. In 2023, AI lifted the stock significantly, turning that original $10,000 into an incredible $82,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's historical cyclicality is a factor investors must consider\n\nThere are two important lessons about Nvidia's stock that this hypothetical exercise provides:\n\nIt is a cyclical company. Most of its sales aren't subscription-based, so its incredible revenue right now might not seem so incredible by next year. As a result, investors need to consider how much demand the AI market can support. Once this limit is reached, expect sales to fall, which should cause the stock to collapse. You must buy and hold companies for the long term. Many investors likely sold Nvidia stock in 2022 when it fell apart. While they were still up from their 2020 investment price, it wasn't nearly as much as if they had just held shares through the difficult times.\n\nSo what should investors do with Nvidia's stock now? In my opinion, if you don't own any Nvidia stock now, it might not be a great time to establish a position due to its high valuation.\n\nHowever, this could be a terrible decision if the market for Nvidia's GPUs is much larger than I expect. So, taking a smaller position (no more than 1% of your portfolio) might not be a bad idea.\n\nIf you've held on to Nvidia's stock for this long, it's likely a substantial part of your portfolio due to its recent performance. Taking some gains here is wise, as the shares are highly valued and still cyclical (as many investors might be forgetting).\n\nNvidia's stock has gone through a few boom-and-bust cycles; I don't know when the next bust is coming, but I think it's prudent to prepare should it come soon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "With 67% ownership, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) boasts of strong institutional backing",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in NVIDIA implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nA look at the shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 67% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that NVIDIA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.0% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.\n\nStory continues\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of NVIDIA\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nShareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$47b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for NVIDIA  you should know about.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Could Outperform the Nasdaq in 2024",
        "content": "The Magnificent Seven film released in 1960, and its 2016 reboot by the same name depicts seven American gunmen hired to protect a small village from a band of outlaws. However, the movie's name was repurposed in 2023, when Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett used the phrase to describe the seven most influential tech stocks.\n\nThe companies he considers to be the \"Magnificent Seven\" include Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla. These tech names dominate their respective markets and have all delivered more growth over the past 12 months than the Nasdaq Composite. NVDA Chart\n\nMeanwhile, many of these companies will likely continue beating the market in the new year thanks to budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. So, here are two \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that could outperform the Nasdaq in 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nShares in Nvidia skyrocketed in 2023 as it cornered the market on AI chips, achieving an estimated 90% market share. The company beat all other chipmakers to the punch while competitors including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have yet to catch up. As a result, Nvidia has formed lucrative partnerships with AI-minded companies across tech, supplying its hardware to countless names.\n\nWhile many companies are currently in a race to develop the most advanced AI models and produce attractive software tools for the commercial and consumer sectors, Nvidia is cashing in by selling its hardware to most of these organizations. So as AI chip demand has soared, so have Nvidia's earnings.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended October 2023), the company's revenue climbed 206% year over year, while operating income increased by more than 1,600%. The legendary results were mainly attributed to a spike in AI graphic processing unit (GPU) sales, represented by a 279% rise in data center revenue.\n\nIn 2024, competition could heat up in the chip industry, with AMD and Intel both expected to begin shipping new AI products. However, Nvidia's immense dominance will likely be challenging to overcome.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, data from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% until at least 2030 and exceed a value of $1 trillion, suggesting there will be plenty of room for Nvidia to retain its leading position and alternative chip options to enter the industry. NVDA EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThis chart shows that Nvidia's earnings could achieve nearly $20 per share in fiscal 2025. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 40 yields a stock price of $800, projecting 61% growth over the next year.\n\nConsidering the Nasdaq Composite has risen at a CAGR of 25% over the past five years, I'd say there's an excellent chance Nvidia will once again outperform it in 2024.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is another Magnificent Seven stock with considerable growth potential in the new year. The company has ramped up its expansion into AI in 2023, unveiling its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini, in early December.\n\nAccording to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, the new model \"represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts\" the company has undertaken. Gemini is expected to be highly competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 and could open countless growth opportunities for Alphabet in AI.\n\nAlphabet already has a powerful position in tech as the home of potent brands, including Google, YouTube, and Android. In fact, the company boasts at least nine products with over 1 billion users, with the top being Google Search, Android, and Chrome.\n\nThe tech giant has used its vast user base to build a lucrative advertising business, responsible for about 25% of the $680 billion digital ad market, according to Statista. However, the popularity of its services could just as easily be used to bolster its position in AI. With the power of Gemini, Alphabet could expand its AI tools on Google Cloud, create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, offer more pointed advertising, and improve the user experience on YouTube. GOOGL EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAlphabet's earnings are projected to hit nearly $7 per share next fiscal year. Running a similar calculation to Nvidia and multiplying that figure by Alphabet's forward P/E of 24 results in a share price of $168. Based on the company's current stock position, that would deliver growth of 21%.\n\nWhile that doesn't outperform the Nasdaq Composite's CAGR of 25% over the past five years, there are plenty of reasons to believe that's a conservative estimate. In 2024, Alphabet will probably begin seeing a return on its investment in AI with the help of Gemini, which could considerably boost its earnings and shares. As a result, I wouldn't bet against seeing this Magnificent Seven stock beat the Nasdaq in 2024. It's a compelling buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the12 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin. For a quick overview of 5 such stocks, read our article 5 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nMarkets are off to a slow start in 2024 as investors go into a wait and see mode regarding the Fed’s plan of action for possible rate cuts this year. While the NASDAQ slid in the first few days of the year and some circles are voicing skepticism over the Magnificent Seven’s ability to carry forward the gains seen in 2023, long-term analysts believe technology stocks have more room to run in 2024. Part of the reason why many notable analysts are bullish on the technology sector is the power of AI and generative AI software’s benefits for common people.\n\nWhy Did Tech Stocks Decline in the Start of 2024?\n\nJosh Brown, CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, recently talked on CNBC about the reason behind the decline in tech stocks in the first week of 2024. Brown said that there is a lot of profit-taking activity going on right now as investors saw remarkable returns from the technology sector in 2023, especially in the fourth quarter of the year. Brown said that as a wealth manager he can totally understand the logic of taking profits early in the year especially after such a spectacular rally. Brown, however, emphasized that the decline in tech stocks might look like these companies are “stumbling” but that is not the case.\n\nJosh Brown also said that 2024 is the year when AI goes from “concept to product.” While he is not totally happy with their valuations,  Alphabet and Amazon are the top two tech stocks to own according to Brown because of their AI catalysts.\n\nWise investors know that a decline in stocks for a week or two or even a few months for that matter means nothing when seen in the long run. Tech companies working on products and services that impact millions of people around the world with strong balance sheets are expected to keep gaining momentum in the months and years to come. That’s why many analysts and money managers are piling into these stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at some of the top technology stock picks of billionaire Ken Griffin. Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Investment Group Methodology For this article we scanned Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel LLC's 13F portfolio for the third quarter of 2023 and picked the fund's top 12 technology stock picks. Some notable names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\n12. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $319M\n\nKen Griffin’s Citadel decreased its stake in ride-sharing platform company Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) by 11% in the third quarter. The fund still owns a $319 million stake in Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER).\n\nCiti analyst Ronald Josey added Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) to his top picks for 2024. Here is what the analyst said about these companies:\n\n“Underlying these themes are companies that, in our view, are stronger than they were a year ago. Most have gone through cost reductions and optimizations themselves resulting in sustainable margin expansion and stronger overall balance sheets.”\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was the top contributor in the quarter following a better-than-expected 2Q23 earnings report and 3Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $33.6 billion were up 16% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17 billion grew 25% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 12% from last year. 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $916 million, up $552 million year over year, significantly beat Street estimates of $845 million and the company generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Management guided to continuing growth in 3Q Gross Bookings (17%-20% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $975-1,025 million).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.3 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.4 billion of investments, the company’s enterprise value of $95 billion equates to just over 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”\n\n11. AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $319M\n\nAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) Inc. ranks 11th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Griffin’s fund increased its stake in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) by 182% in the third quarter, ending the quarter with a $319 million stake in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 52 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).\n\nMiller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.\n\nAT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”\n\n10. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $324M\n\nEven though Ken Griffin’s hedge fund cut its stake in social media platform company Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) by a whopping 53% in the third quarter, the fund still ended the period with a $324 million stake in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is enjoying a bullish view from analysts and hedge funds since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) successfully executed cost cutting and integrated AI in its products that led to huge usage growth.\n\nLike Meta, hedge funds are also buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nBlue Tower Asset Management made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On February 24, 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released Llama, their LLM project, with the code being open-source but the training weights being kept proprietary. Nonetheless, within a week the training weights were leaked for the project. This release of the weights for 65 billion parameter model was a huge gift for open-source programmers to begin experimenting upon. Within weeks, other developers were creating innovations building on the model. There has been a race towards developing low-budget fine-tuning projects that can be trained for specific applications at the cost of a few hundred dollars in some cases. Some of these LLM projects can even be run on individual computers rather than data centers.\n\nAfter the voluntary release of Llama’s architecture as open-source, the leak of the model weights ended up being a blessing in disguise for Meta. The innovation and improvements that followed were all built on Meta’s AI codebase. They were able to get these innovations without needing to pay any of the open-source developers for their efforts. This also demonstrates that the business advantage of the large tech companies is not in their models or AI codebase. Any innovations that the companies develop are unlikely to stay within the walls of the companies due to the mobility of researchers being poached between companies by recruiters. However, as these new model improvement technologies are made, the big tech companies have a scale advantage. They will be able to employ it into models that have more data, more compute budget, more parameters and therefore more intelligence in the resulting neural net.”\n\n9. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $355M\n\nDell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) ranks 9th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Citadel sold 818,057 shares of Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) during the third quarter. But the fund still owns a $355 million stake in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL).\n\nRecently, Citi opened a 90-day catalyst watch on Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) amid a bullish outlook of demand in the PC market.\n\n8. Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $399M\n\nKen Griffin’s hedge fund bought 122,566 more Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) shares during the third quarter, increasing its stake in the travel platform company to $399 million. The company is one of the best tech stocks to buy according to Ken Griffin.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) was Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $1.1 billion stake in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG).\n\nIn November, Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) posted Q3 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $72.32, beating estimates by $4.40. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 21.3% year over year to $7.34 billion, beating estimates by $80 million.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Following significant under-performance, some high-quality businesses in these sectors are now becoming more attractive from a valuation perspective – in our language they are now getting warmer on our Bench of potential investments.\n\nOur ‘all-weather’ portfolio centred around our unique definition of ‘quality’ delivered strong performance in the September quarter. Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Intuit and Natural Resource Partners, in alphabetical order), and another three companies almost reached this level of positive contribution. No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.\n\nAs part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.\n\nBooking Holdings, the world’s leading online travel agency, continues to benefit from a strong global travel environment with particular strength in Europe, Booking Holdings’ core market. Fears of peak ‘revenge travel’ following COVID-19 lockdowns have been misplaced in our view. We assess current travel volumes to be only slightly elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 trends, with some regions, particularly outbound travel from China, still relatively depressed. Anyone who has travelled anywhere recently will be nodding when we say hotel rates have increased meaningfully in recent times. Accommodation providers are generally doing quite well, but the increased hotel rates have been necessary to offset inflation in costs such as employee salaries and additional cleaning services. As Booking Holdings ‘clips the ticket’ of accommodation spend, the company has benefitted from increased average daily hotel rates. Importantly, Booking Holdings continues to invest in its business, improving the reach, quality and range of services it provides, resulting in gains in market share and an extension of its industry leadership position. Booking Holdings is now more fairly valued by the market, but still provides attractive base case risk-adjusted returns and remains one of the larger investments in the Fund.”\n\n7. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $552M\n\nMicron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the best technology stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. UBS recently called Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) one of its top semiconductor picks for 2024.\n\n\"Even after this rally into year-end, we would remain overweight semis in 2024 as inventory has peaked and started converting to revenue,\" UBS’s Timothy Arcuri said.\n\n6. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $563M\n\nCybersec company Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) ranks 6th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Citadel had a $563 million stake in Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) as of the end of September.\n\nRecently, Raymond James downgraded Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) stock to Market Perform from Outperform amid valuation concerns.\n\n\"To be clear, Palo Alto Networks is a great company, technology leader, execution has been stellar, and [Raymond James] doesn't fight investors that have a time horizon longer than its 12-month mandate. However, [Raymond James] believes the risk/reward in the stock is becoming less favorable,” Raymond James said.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Across the Information Technology universe, we seek companies possessing differentiated capabilities, products, and services. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) supplies network and cloud-based security solutions to enterprises, service providers, and government entities. The latest quarter was mixed with the company falling shy versus the Street on billings, in line for revenues, and outpacing earnings. Palo Alto’s updated guidance was materially ahead of lowered Street expectations. Nevertheless, its shares pulled back by -8%.”\n\nLike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Palo Alto is one of the stocks hedge funds are buying.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nKen Griffin Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates' Top 15 Dividend Stocks 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure.None. 12 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffinwas initially published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value",
        "content": "In 2023, an extraordinary phenomenon unfolded in the stock market: The Magnificent Seven, a group of top-tier stocks, experienced a remarkable surge in their value, ranging from a solid 50% gain to a staggering 240% climb.\n\nThis impressive performance catapulted them into the spotlight as some of the market's most lucrative investments.\n\nAmid this financial whirlwind, a particular focus has been placed on Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Savvy investors, delving into the nuanced world of financial metrics, have pointed out the company's forward price-earnings ratio is notably lower compared to its peers in the Magnificent Seven, raising concern.\n\nAlphabet's valuation portrays the market's anticipation of its future, influenced by pivotal factors such as the seismic shifts brought about by artificial intelligence-driven changes in online consumer behavior, Google's fluctuating share in the digital advertising market and the looming shadow of an antitrust lawsuit. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nDecoding market dynamics: How Google stands in the competitive landscape\n\nThe market attributes a higher price-earnings ratio to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), while Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) falls within a comparable range when juxtaposed with Alphabet.\n\nThe price-earnings ratio is not an arbitrary figure that an investor can assign to determine value, as it has implicit cash flow assumptions. A business that generates a high return on invested capital has more potential to drive growth in cash flow. A high ROIC indicates a company's superior profitability and efficiency in capital allocation. This distinction becomes evident when comparing Apple and Microsoft to Google and Meta.\n\nApple and Microsoft have consistently outperformed Google and Meta in terms of return on invested capital. Their last 10-year average ROICs stood at 25.90% and 16.6%, respectively, while Google and Meta's stood at 13% and 16.20%, respectively. As a result, the figures show the other three peer companies have outperformed Google in terms of profitability and capital efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the contrary, the other three companies in this group, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may not boast impressive ROIC, but their allure lies in higher growth potential, for which investors willingly pay a premium. Specifically, Nvidia and Tesla, being smaller in terms of revenue size, contribute to their distinct valuation dynamics. Meanwhile, Amazon consistently maintains a high price-earnings ratio due to investor optimism surrounding its expanding presence in the retail sector and dominance in the cloud business.\n\nHowever, the search giant's declining market share in digital ad revenue is generating concerns, introducing a nuanced landscape. Lastly, the increasing use cases of AI represent both an opportunity and a threat to its existing business model, while developments in anti-trust lawsuits add a layer of skepticism. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhat are the concerns for Alphabet that are embedded in the price-earnings multiple?\n\nAlphabet recently outperformed expectations for its quarterly performance, beating earnings per share estimates by 6%, rebounding from a slowdown experienced in previous quarters. However, apprehensions persist, particularly concerning Google's search and overall ad revenue business. Lastly, its search revenue accounts for approximately 57% of total revenue and around 73% of total advertising revenue. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhile you may consider it cyclical, the declining market share in digital ad revenue does pose a question of whether Alphabet is losing its long-established dominance in this space.\n\nMeta Platforms and Amazon continue to gain market share in the digital ad revenue market, while Google experiences a decline. Moreover, the way we retrieve information on the internet is changing. AI chatbots are supplanting many of the activities we traditionally performed on search engines. The company realizes the threat to search ad revenue, prompting it to actively address the challenge and make rapid strides in integrating AI across all its services. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: InsiderIntelligence.com\n\nThe recent launch of Gemini, a family of large language models by Google, seems exciting, as it can counter the threat of other LLMs like GPT-4, Claude and Llama. However, it still needs to solve the challenges in the existing business model, where search contributes the most to the business.\n\nAlphabet's cloud division has experienced impressive growth, yet it operates in a highly competitive landscape where Amazon and Microsoft dominate. Investors are dissatisfied with the recent slowdown in the growth of the cloud business, which decreased to 22.5% year over year during the third quarter from 37.6% a year prior.\n\nGoogle's legal battle and the future of search\n\nAlphabet's Google is under legal scrutiny amid allegations of employing questionable tactics to uphold its status as the world's foremost search engine. The U.S. Justice Department claims Google paid massive sums to companies like Apple to make it the default search engine on their devices. Google also admitted that it shares 36% of revenue with Apple for the search results on the iPhone. We could draw several scenarios from this lawsuit.\n\nThe first scenario is that Google wins the case and stays the default search engine on devices like iPhones, and their partnership with Apple remains the same.\n\nThere is another scenario that may go in favor of Google. If the DOJ compels Apple to display a choice screen where users can select their preferred search engine, a majority would likely choose Google, and the search giant would not have to pay anything to Apple.\n\nBut the worst-case scenario would be that Apple develops its own native search engine that would be the default for its Safari browser on all devices, and users would not have any choice.\n\nBeing a default search engine is a huge advantage because most people who put search queries on the browser address bar need to intuitively think about which search engine they post their queries in.\n\nSince Apple will be losing out on revenue from Google in this scenario, there is a possibility that it will try to come up with its own native search engine to recoup the lost revenue. Hence, this scenario could harm Google's search revenue as Safari, Apple's native browser, holds around 20% market share.\n\nWaymo's expansion and Wing's drone delivery partnership with Walmart\n\nGoogle's other bets include several projects. In the recent earnings call, the company mentioned Waymo (an autonomous driving technology company) onboarded more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually added over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist.\n\nAt the same time, Wing, a drone delivery service owned by Google, has unveiled a strategic collaboration with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to offer drone delivery services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nWhile these developments are exciting, they have yet to reach a level of significance that would substantially impact the company's financials or long-term potential.\n\nFurther, in the age of AI, how we retrieve information online is changing. While Google is responding to these changes, its predominant business model, centered around search engine queries, faces potential risks stemming from shifts in how users consume information.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a new digital era, the shift from traditional search engines to AI-driven chatbots marks a pivotal change in consumer behavior. The relentless advancement of LLMs is poised to revolutionize how we seek information, potentially rendering traditional search queries obsolete. This evolution raises critical questions about the future of advertising in an AI-dominated landscape.\n\nWhile the full extent of these changes remains shrouded in the mists of the future, their potential impact on giants like Alphabet cannot be underestimated. For investors, concerns over these AI-induced shifts challenging the company's dominance in search revenue are justified and crucial in navigating the uncertain waters of technological progression.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "EU Antitrust Chief Margrethe Vestager will meet with chief executives of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and OpenAI in Palo Alto and San Francisco next week to discuss digital regulation and antitrust policies.\n\nAxios Global Tech Correspondent Ryan Heath joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into what to expect from the meetings and potential outcomes from the meetings for these companies.\n\n\"They [Big Tech] have come to realize the EU isn't going away. They don't particularly like the way the EU approaches regulation, but they know that it's a very lucrative market, and it makes more sense to play ball with them at some level,\" Heath explains. \"There's this constant tension between how do they give a little bit to the EU, look cooperative, but at the same time, don't do anything to cannibalize their business.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager announcing she will now meet with chief execs from key tech giants next week, including leaders from Apple, NVIDIA, alphabet, and Broadcom. For more on this, we turn to Ryan Heath, Axios Global tech correspondent.\n\nThank you for joining us this morning, Ryan. So we know that the EU has really been taking the lead here on framing an AI framework here. What are the expectations for this trip?\n\nRYAN HEATH: Well, it's a doublE-hatted trip actually. So yes, the EU has locked down its new AI Act. But the big thing there is it's actually not going to be enforced for another year for the first half. And the second half, it's going to be two years before they start implementing it. But the way regulators work, obviously, is playing catch up to markets a lot of the time. So the previous big piece of legislation, which is about trying to limit the power of big tech gatekeepers. That's really coming into force from March this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo Vestager is going to be here previewing the AI Act, but also a little bit reading the Riot Act about this digital markets legislation, which is really trying to make sure that the big companies run open ecosystems. They don't try and lock you into their app stores. They don't preference their own systems. So she's going to go around these companies one by one. And work through how they're going to relate on this legislation together.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And Ryan, how do you think this is going to be received? Because they're really being perceived as gatekeepers here, but they also want to be at the really at the forefront of some of the legislation, as well. How do you balance that?\n\nRYAN HEATH: Yeah. It's really tricky. So the companies have a very different attitude to 10 or 20 years ago. And some of them are very new too. So they've only ever known this very aggressive European Union. But I think the Googles of the world, the Metas, the Apples, they've come to realize the EU isn't going away. They don't particularly like the way the EU approaches regulation. But they know that it's a very lucrative market. And it makes more sense to play ball with them at some level.\n\nSo there's this constant tension between how do they give a little bit to the EU, look cooperative, but at the same time, don't do anything to cannibalize their business. And that's the constant back and forth between the companies and people like Vestager. And she's back in the hot seat now because she was running for a new position to be head of the European Investment Bank. And she lost out. So now, she's coming back with her tail a little bit between her legs. And she's got one year left to secure her legacy and make a difference.\n\nSo you might see a slightly fine tuned Vestager in these meetings as well.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So are we expecting her to really try and make her mark here, or really try and do what it takes to really get some results here? As you said, because the legislation isn't supposed to kick in for another year.\n\nRYAN HEATH: Yeah. I think she's really got to try and secure some results. She's a pragmatist at the end of the day. She said fairly radical and ambitious goals. And then she puts her head down and tries to find pragmatic ways to get some of the way there. And now, she's really into that tail end of her time in Brussels. And she's had a few defeats in big court cases over the past 12 and 18 months. So it's really time to show some results. It's not enough to just wave a piece of legislation around. She's got to actually make a difference in how these companies operate and how the market itself is structured.\n\nAnd so I think there's going to be a lot of that pragmatism on show during this visit.",

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStryker uses AI and machine learning to improve patient outcomes and efficiency in a number of areas, including surgical planning, medical imaging, and patient monitoring. Stryker’s Blueprint platform combines AI with augmented reality to help surgeons visualize and plan procedures. Mako is Stryker’s robotic-arm-assisted surgery platform that can be used for total knee, hip and partial knee replacement procedures. The platform’s technology enables surgeons to do pre-operative planning as well as precise surgeries, thus helping them provide effective and personalized surgical experiences to patients. The platform is currently the leading player in the robotic-assisted surgery market, with its installations having touched record levels in most of the quarters in the past three years.\n\nStryker’s focus on the continued expansion of Mako in new patient populations will likely enable the robotic platform’s growth momentum to continue in the rest of 2023. Moreover, continued software upgrades like the Q Guidance platform and the addition of technologies to work along with the platform should boost adoption.\n\nSYK’s earnings are expected to grow by 10.1% in the next five years. It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.\n\nNVIDIA is gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.

A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.\n\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are rapidly benefiting from the proliferation of AI. By applying its GPUs in AI models, the company is expanding its base in other untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, which will support its earnings and revenues. The company recently collaborated with the top-ranked OEMs, including Dell, HP and Lenovo, to deliver powerful workstations, including Quadro RTX GPUs and its new CUDAX AI accelerated software. A steady ramp-up of new products is enabling the company to gain a competitive edge over the likes of AMD and Intel and also widen its market share.\n\nNVDA’s earnings are expected to grow by 13.5% in the next five years. It currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Sell in January Before They Crash and Burn",
        "content": "In the tech world, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has been a game changer, driving innovations and reshaping industries. The excitement around this technology has led to predictions of a massive AI industry, capturing the interest of investors. Yet, it’s important to approach AI stocks with caution and consider which AI stocks to sell.\n\nAlthough Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has benefited from its crucial role in AI processing, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) investment in OpenAI and integration of AI tools in its cloud services solidified its position in the market. However, not all stocks associated with AI have foundational merit.\n\nTherefore, navigating AI investments requires careful consideration. This journey is about more than just saving time; it’s about protecting your financial well-being. Let’s identify the underperforming AI stocks to help you make informed decisions. The aim is to ensure your investments are sound, offering sustainable returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlackLine (BL) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of BlackLine (BL).\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackLine (NASDAQ:BL), a once-promising contender in the financial automation arena, now treads through a challenging phase. As BlackLine evolves from a dynamic mid-cap to a mature software firm, it confronts a fiercely competitive market with few growth drivers. Given its struggling AI integration in a fast-evolving sector, this shift highlights BlackLine as a potential AI stock to sell.\n\nMoreover, BlackLine’s director, Thomas Unterman, jazzed up the stock market buzz by selling 750 shares at $60.58. This move, often seen as a director’s lack of confidence in future performances, along with its share price declining 16.94% over the past year, added a bit of intrigue to BlackLine’s stock story.\n\nTherefore, BlackLine’s shares have plummeted 17.77% over the past year, facing stiff competition from giants like SAP, Oracle and Workday. The company’s heavy reliance on resellers for sales, substantial debt, and an unattractive valuation positions it as a precarious investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nIn the dynamic social media landscape, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is currently facing a series of challenging developments. The company’s performance in 2023 depicted a worrying scenario, highlighting various issues that have raised concerns about its future viability.\n\nFinancially, compounding these worries, SNAP’s stock performance has not been encouraging, with a 1.36% decline year to date. This decline is exacerbated by year-over-year revenue growth of negative 1.21% and a stark 21.78% fall in forward EBITDA growth. When pieced together, these financial indicators strongly advise investors to tread carefully when contemplating investment in SNAP.\n\nMoreover, in response to Snap Inc.’s challenges, CEO Evan Spiegel plans to boost advertising revenue by over 20% in 2024. However, this strategy appears uncertain given the difficult economic conditions, escalating losses, and TipRanksanalysts having a consensus rating of hold with 20.28% downside potential. Therefore, investing in SNAP stock now seems risky amidst these significant financial obstacles.\n\nC3.ai (AI) Automated stock trading concept. Robotic hand analyzing financial data on stock exchange, artificial intelligence utilization to predict precise price change in stock market. Trailblazing. trillion-dollar ai stocks\n\nSource: Owlie Productions / Shutterstock.com\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) investors are increasingly uneasy with recent shifts. The company’s reliance on nebulous metrics like customer engagement, which it acknowledges doesn’t truly mirror market reception of its products, is concerning, subtly casting doubts on its future trajectory and strategic direction.\n\nFinancially, the picture is bleak. The company’s shares have plummeted 26.33% over the past six months. More alarming is the trailing twelve months’ EBIT margin, which is a disturbing negative 104.97%, starkly contrasting the sector median of 4.92%. The revenue of $73.23 million, which fell short of expectations by $1.1 million, further erodes investor confidence.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s pricing strategy exacerbates its troubles, as its price-to-sales ratio is worse than 89.02% of its competitors in the software industry. This high cost and its dismal financials mark it as one of the market’s most overvalued stocks. Investors must proceed cautiously as a notable overvaluation marks BlackLine’s path.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Intel's (INTC) Outlook Hurt by Mobileye's Revenue Slowdown",
        "content": "Intel Corporation INTC is likely to witness a dent in its revenue stream as its subsidiary Mobileye Global Inc. MBLY expects a substantial downturn in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nMobileye, an industry leader in autonomous driver assistance technology (ADAS), recently announced its Q4 and full-year 2023 preliminary financial metrics and also outlined the financial outlook for fiscal 2024. These selective preliminary metrics provide clarity regarding Mobileye’s business operations and potential impact on the majority stakeholder Intel in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nMobileye expects fourth-quarter 2023 revenues in the range of $634-638 million and full-year 2023 revenues between $2,076-2,080 million. The figures are fairly consistent with the company’s previously provided guidance.\r\n\r\nHowever, management anticipates a staggering 50% net sales drop in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $458 million revenues in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 revenues are estimated to be $1,830-$1,960 million, suggesting a downturn from the fiscal 2023 tally.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for the first quarter of 2024, it expects operating loss to be between $257 million and 242 million. Intel owns an 88% stake in the company, and in the September quarter, it generated $530 million in revenues from solid sales of Mobileye’s EyeQ products. The recent developments will likely hurt Intel’s top-line performance in the upcoming period.\r\n\r\nManagement has highlighted that the current situation arose from excess inventory build-up at some of Mobileye's tier 1 customers, estimating an excess of about 6-7 million units of EyeQ SoCs in inventory. Nevertheless, this is not an indication of falling demand for driver assistance technology among automakers.\r\n\r\nTier 1 client’s decision to elevate inventory levels was influenced by various factors. Enterprises faced significant headwinds in 2021 and 2022 induced by supply chain constraints. The inventory build-up is a strategic move to minimize the impact of part shortages during supply chain disruptions. Certain OEMs’ decisions to cut production during 2023 also affected customers’ decisions.\r\n\r\nOwing to these factors, the projected shipment of EyeQ computer chips is estimated at 31-33 million units in 2024, down from around 37 million units in 2023. Lower shipments will negatively affect the company’s profit margin. Operating loss for the full year 2024 is estimated in the band of $468-378 million compared with an expected loss of around $39-33 million in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nAs demand for ADAS remains strong and the supply chain improves, Mobileye expects excess inventory levels to significantly drop in the first quarter of 2024. Inventory levels will likely normalize by the end of 2024. On the other hand, SuperVision shipments are expected to reach around 175-195K units, up from 100K units in 2023. Owing to these factors, Mobileye expects that revenues from Q2 to Q4 on a combined basis will increase from a flat to a mid-single-digit percentage. This in turn is likely to take a toll on Intel’s overall revenues.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Mobileye has helped Intel to rapidly penetrate the autonomous car technology market, currently dominated by the likes of NVIDIA and Qualcomm. With the buyout, Intel has gained access to Mobileye’s technologies related to cameras, in-car networking, sensor chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management.\r\n\r\nIntel recently launched AI chips for data centers and PCs. This marks one of the largest architectural shifts for the company in 40 years. The strategic decision is primarily aimed at gaining a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector, spanning cloud and enterprise servers to networks, volume clients and ubiquitous edge environments, in tune with the evolving market dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe stock has gained 63.2% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 129%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIntel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.99%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 19.64%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit.

The company provides a range of wireless products and services and a high-quality network to increase the competitiveness of local businesses and improve the efficiency of government operations.\r\n\r\nU.S. Cellular has undertaken concrete steps to accelerate subscriber additions and improve churn management.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Coinbase Global, Block, Interactive Brokers Group and CME Group",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 5, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, Block Inc. SQ, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR and CME Group Inc.'s CME.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch After a Solid 2023\n\nThe cryptocurrency market witnessed an impressive turnaround in 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency worldwide, soared 157% last year. Other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) also saw massive price hikes.\n\nThe space is likely to remain buoyant in 2024. U.S. stock markets have soared amid a clear indication from the Fed's December FOMC meeting that the current interest rate hike cycle, which elevated the Fed fund rate to a 22-year high of 5.25-5.50% from 0-0.25% in March 2022, has finally ended. Moreover, the December FOMC meeting dot-plot showed that on average, Fed officials are expecting at least three rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2024.\n\nA lower interest rate regime will be very helpful for high-growth sectors like technology and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors.\n\nSpeculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission is set to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has also raised investors' optimism. The agency is expected to respond to the application filed by ARK Investments and 21Shares by Jan 10, while financial major BlackRock Inc.'s proposal is expected to be addressed by Mar 15.\n\nMoreover, the next Bitcoin Halving will occur in the first half of 2024. When a halving occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five crypto-centric stocks with strong potential for 2024.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the NVDA stock usually soars on a booming crypto market.

        "content": "After a solid 2023, cryptocurrencies have started this year on a high. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency, has particularly been on a dream run over the past couple of months and the rally is set to gain pace in the coming months as multiple positive developments have given investors’ sentiment a boost.\n\nBitcoin rallied past $43,000 in December 2023, and on Jan 2, it surged past the $45,000 mark for the first time since April 2022. Although the cryptocurrency retreated from its 21-month high, it hovered around $44,200 on Jan 4.\n\nOver the past three months, Bitcoin has rallied more than 61%. The Federal Reserve didn’t hike interest rates in its last three FOMC meetings in 2023 after raising interest rates by 525 basis points, as its aggressive monetary tightening campaign has seen inflation decline sharply.\n\nCooling inflation has also raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon end its monetary tightening campaign and start cutting rates this year, which could be as early as in March. Higher interest rates have adverse effects on growth-focused sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso, investors are optimistic about the imminent approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This approval is expected to have a significant positive impact, providing strong support to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nInvestors are currently looking forward to the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC as early as the first half of 2024.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. COIN offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase Global’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 92%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 16.7% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 14.4% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.

Through PYPL, users can use cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services from online merchants. Additionally, PayPal’s mobile wallet platform, Venmo, also allows users to engage in cryptocurrency buying and selling activities.\n\nPayPal Holdings’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 20.6%.

        "title": "2023 in Review: Key Stock Trends and Sector Shifts Unveiled",
        "content": "The year 2023 was a great one for the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14% to finish the year at a record high. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 25% and came within a whisker of a record close. And the technology-focused Nasdaq index increased 43% to register its best year since the internet rally of 1999. So, what can we expect in 2024? How will the markets perform in the year ahead? It’s still very early days, but already we are seeing some trends and shifts take hold in the market. The winners and losers of the past year could change in the coming months as investor preferences shift and sentiment takes a different turn. Interest rate cuts, wars in foreign lands, and a potential global recession could each influence markets over the next 12 months. As the New Year begins, we offer 2023 in review: key stock trends and sector shifts unveiled.\n\nBank Stocks Are Hot Again\n\nAs soon as Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that three interest rate cuts are likely in 2024, the sun began to shine on bank stocks. Despite their earnings holding up well, bank stocks, as a group, had a miserable 2023. The S&P Banks Index has registered a measly 2% return over the last 12 months, compared to a 25% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index. And that small gain in the banking index was achieved after Powell announced the potential rate cuts in December.\n\nOf course, things really got ugly for all bank stocks after the failures of several regional lenders last spring, including Silicon Valley Bank (OTCMKTS:SIVBQ) and Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY). However, investors and traders are now putting capital back into bank stocks, with interest rates having now peaked and likely to decline in the coming months. Since the start of the fourth quarter of 2023 last October, the S&P Banks Index has climbed 30% higher and turned positive, with most of that increase occurring in the last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInfluential bank stocks such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) are each up 10% since the start of December.\n\nBioTech Is Having A Moment\n\nAnother beneficiary of the expected rate cuts this year appears to be biotech stocks. The equal-weighted SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI) has risen 38% since the broader market began to rally at the end of October. The gain is a major reversal for the biotech sector. Before Halloween, the biotech ETF was down 20% on the year. But now, biotech stocks are rallying again as the prospect of lower interest rates comes into view.\n\nThis makes sense as most biotech stocks, the majority of which are small start-ups, rely on borrowed capital to fund their operations and drug research. In addition to the overall rally among biotech stocks, there has also been a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions among biotech companies over the last two months. And there are reports that biotech executives are buying up company shares as the stocks rally, providing a further boost of confidence for the sector.\n\nOn the first trading day of 2024, as the technology-laden Nasdaq index suffered its worst performance since last October, shares of biopharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) rose 13% on news of an analyst upgrade. MRNA stock has now risen 37% since the beginning of December.\n\nMicrochip and Semiconductor Stocks Are Pulling Back\n\nFueled by the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), stocks of microchip and semiconductor companies led the market higher in 2023. Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) increased 238% last year, while the stock of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 125%. Now, though, it appears that stocks of chip and semiconductor companies are pulling back. AMD stock has dropped 9% since the last trading day of 2023, while NVDA stock has fallen 5% and appears unable to break above resistance at $500 a share.\n\nOther chip and semi stocks are also sliding lower to start 2024. This could be the result of short-term profit-taking or the start of a bigger rotation out of tech and a move away from the AI trade that dominated markets last year. It will take some time to play out, but this type of sector rotation is common in the market. In 2022, stocks of oil and gas companies dominated only to become among the worst performers last year as investors dumped big oil in favor of big tech.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Dividend reinvesting allows you to receive higher distributions in subsequent quarters and increase your compounding returns. Many investors continue to reinvest their dividend payments until they are ready to live off their dividends and wish to retire.\n\nWhile you can choose from many dividend-paying stocks, some of them are better than others. Finding stocks that combine respectable yields with consistent rate appreciation can result in good long-term returns. Many corporations raise their dividends each year and continue to reward shareholders with buybacks. These are some of the top dividend stocks to consider for reinvestment plans.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) looks like one of the best dividend stocks in the market. The company’s yield is close to 2% and it has been raising the dividend by over 10% each year. Broadcom regularly reports revenue and earnings growth while maintaining profit margins above 35%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe semiconductor giant stands to benefit greatly from artificial intelligence. Although Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) blew Broadcom away in stock gains, it’s been gaining considerable ground since the recent VMware acquisition.\n\nBroadcom shares have more than doubled in the last year and have soared by 342% over the past five years. Broadcom seems destined to become a trillion-dollar company and is about halfway there. Unlike other big tech companies, Broadcom offers a healthy dividend and has consistently hiked it higher over the years.\n\nShares currently trade at a 24 forward P/E ratio. The world’s reliance on chips and Broadcom’s synergies with VMware make it an enticing long-term pick for dividend investors seeking growth.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) was previously flat for multiple years but has surged by 32% year-to-date. That’s still more than 20% removed from its all-time high which the stock can reclaim as data centers gain demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital Realty Trust has a portfolio of over 300 data centers in more than 50 metro areas. The company has over 5,000 customers that use its space for their IT architecture. Companies involved in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and information technology need to invest in data centers like the ones DLR provides.\n\nThe potency of data centers combined with the growth of artificial intelligence contributed to an 18% year-over-year revenue growth rate for the third quarter. The company has formed ventures with GI Partners, TPG Real Estate, and Brookfield Infrastructure among others to expand its portfolio.\n\nDigital Realty Trust has a healthy balance sheet which features almost twice as many total assets as total liabilities. The company’s dividend yield currently sits at 3.60%.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nBig Blue has been staging a comeback after several years of stagnancy for investors which included a lost decade depending on when you bought shares. Looking in the present, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has gained 16% year-to-date and is up by 52% over the past five years.\n\nThe turnaround is fueled by strategic acquisitions of companies like Red Hat along with artificial intelligence. Revenue only goes up by single digits while profit margins have been expanding nicely. The company reported 5% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and more than doubled its net income.\n\nAlthough IBM has staged good growth in recent quarters, it is still a mature company. Investors get to enjoy a dividend yield above 4%, but dividend growth is minimal. In 2023, the company hiked its quarterly dividend from $1.65 per share to $1.66 per share. That’s less than a 1% year-over-year increase for the dividend, and IBM has been hiking the dividend by only $0.01 per share since 2020.\n\nGrowing profits and top-line expansion can help the company raise its quarterly dividend by more than $0.01 per share each year. However, investors should view it as a blue-chip stock that offers more safety and a higher yield than other tech companies.\n\nStag Industrial (STAG)  stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes D\n\nSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com\n\nStag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) has a real estate portfolio of warehouses and storage facilities. The company has 568 properties encompassing 112 million square feet in 41 states. The company has a star-studded list of clients that include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) among others.\n\nInvestors get to enjoy a 3.75% dividend yield and monthly dividend distributions. While you can get monthly dividends by investing in enough companies, some stocks like STAG make it easy to receive frequent payouts. The company recently raised its monthly dividend from $0.121667 per share to $0.1225 per share. The annual dividend currently comes to $1.47 per share. Last year, it was at $1.46 per share.\n\nInvestors should approach Stag Industrial with the same dividend growth expectations as IBM. You won’t get much dividend growth but get a high yield from a stable company. Shares have gained 22% year-to-date and are up by 60% over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has the lowest dividend yield out of the stocks on this list but it makes up for it in every other way. It’s easy to overlook the 0.80% dividend yield when shares have gained 57% year-to-date and are up by 275% over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft got its start with personal computers but rapidly expanded into other markets, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, social media through LinkedIn, and gaming. AI Copilots has many investors excited as this artificial intelligence bot will enhance the experience for Microsoft Office products. The technology was enough for Daniel Ives to raise his price target to $450. That price hike implies a 19.7% upside.\n\nInvestors should monitor how the copyright infringement battle plays out between The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) and Microsoft over its artificial intelligence tools. Microsoft has endured legal battles in the past and has rewarded shareholders all the same.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers cloud applications and cloud infrastructure for businesses. The company’s technology helps corporations become more efficient, achieve lower costs and minimize the risk of cyberattacks.\n\nOracle also offers advertising solutions, customer relationship management software, workforce management tools, and other resources. The company has a 1.50% dividend yield and recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.32 per share to $0.40 per share. It’s a 25% increase. Oracle currently has a dividend schedule that indicates one increase every two years.\n\nOracle posted $12.9 billion in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. It’s a 5% year-over-year improvement but growth in the company’s cloud segments indicates more promise. Cloud revenue makes up more than a third of the company’s total revenue and increased by 25% year-over-year.\n\nCloud Infrastructure revenue was the biggest winner with 52% year-over-year growth. That segment makes up more than 10% of the company’s total revenue. During remarks about the earnings report, Oracle CEO Safra Catz expressed optimism about surging demand for cloud infrastructure and generative AI services.\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a mature big tech company that has a market cap of just over $200 billion. The company’s 15 P/E ratio offers reasonable safety compared to other stocks in the industry. Dividend investors get to enjoy a 3% dividend yield but the annual dividend growth rate is in the low single digits.\n\nCisco stock is another case of taking a relatively low risk with limited upside for a respectable yield. The stock has gained 5% year-to-date and is up by 18% over the past five years. Cisco has been acquiring companies to bolster growth and tap into the cloud. The recent acquisition of Isovalent and the headline-grabbing acquisition of Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) indicate the company is exploring opportunities for growth.\n\nCloud computing presents an attractive growth opportunity and can help Cisco achieve enticing revenue and earnings growth in the future. Revenue growth is in the high single digits to low double digits while net income continues to expand rapidly.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AVGO and MSFT.

        "content": "The global robotics industry will continue to pick up steam, making it a great time to consider the best robotics stocks to buy. As we step into 2024, the potential for growth in the robotics industry remains substantial. Investors who are keen on capitalizing on this trend will focus their efforts on companies with market dominance and resilience. This has led to this list of robotics stocks for 2024.\n\nMarket Research Future estimates the global robotics market to eclipse more than $200 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 22.80%. Industry growth will be fueled by process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence and machine learning. Investors should not ignore the market opportunities that are present, as demand rises in an increasingly autonomous world.\n\nNow, let’s discover the 3 best robotics stocks that will go the distance in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands as a frontrunner for the best robotics stocks to buy in 2024. They have set a new standard in artificial intelligence, and momentum is expected to continue this year.\n\nIn 2023, shares surged more than 200% YOY, as the company ramped up their generative AI offerings. Nvidia is currently the leading AI chip supplier, and Wall Street might be overlooking the potential of their robotics platform. Nvidia Isaac, is an end-to-end solution to train, simulate, develop, and deploy advanced robotics applications. This makes it one of those robotics stocks for 2024.\n\nDevelopers can also leverage the Omniverse Cloud, using the Isaac Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). This platform provides advanced mapping, site analytics, fleet and route optimization and can work safely among humans. Nvidia has barely scratched the surface, and their work in AI and accelerated computing will continue to move the needle forward. While the development process can be extremely complex and capital intensive, Nvidia will have the data in order to solve some of the industry’s most pressing problems.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is one of the most compelling robotics stocks for 2024. They are the leading robotics assisted surgery company that has been at the forefront for the last two decades.\n\nIn the early 1990’s, the company received funding from the National Institute of Health to develop a prototype for a robotics surgical system. After raising $46 million in an IPO in 2000, the company received FDA clearance for the Da Vinci surgical system. Now, Intuitive Surgical’s Da Vinci surgical system is used in more than 8,000 hospitals globally.\n\nIn their recent quarterly results, ISRG revenue grew 12% YOY to $1.74 billion. Net income increased 28% YOY to $416 million, or $1.16 per share. Additionally, Da Vinci surgical system installations hit a record of 8,285, with Da Vinci procedures growing 19% from the year prior. Analyst’s project FY23 EPS in the $4.43 – $4.65 range, reflecting approximately 25% YOY growth. This makes Intuitive Surgical one of the best no-brainer robotics stocks for 2024.\n\nUiPath (PATH) robotic arms over medical bed symbolizing medical robotics\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertise\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) closed off the 2023 year up nearly 100%. The company has been making significant progress, after a not so pleasant start from its IPO in 2021.\n\nUiPath is currently one of the leading software companies in process automation (RPA). Process automation is technology that makes it easy for companies to build, deploy, and manage robots that can emulate human actions. Grand View Research, estimates the RPA market to grow at a CAGR of nearly 40% from 2023 – 2030.\n\nIn Q3 fiscal 2024, UiPath saw strong growth with revenue up 24% YOY to $326 million. While the company is still losing money, net loss saw a significant improvement. GAAP net loss was $31.5 million, compared to a net loss of $57.7 million. UiPath now expects ARR for fiscal 2024 in the $1.45 billion to $145.5 range, up from its previous forecasted estimates. If you have a greater appetite for risk, UiPath could be a great long term robotics stock to buy for 2024. This makes it one of those robotics stocks for 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 7 Hottest Tech Stocks to Watch in 2024",
        "content": "With Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) skyrocketing to blistering heights in 2023, the question on everyone’s mind now is as follows: what will be the hottest tech stocks in 2024? At the start of the new year, it’s worth carefully examining this inquiry. After all, we have favorable circumstances moving in the bulls’ direction.\n\nAs a broader point, the economy last year avoided the much-dreaded recession bullet. Along with that, the Federal Reserve saw encouraging disinflationary trends. Indeed, the data was apparently so enticing that Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at possible interest rate cuts in 2024. If so, that would likely undergird hot tech stocks.\n\nMore to the point, the technology machinery appears to be running flat out on all cylinders. As a result, semiconductor specialist Nvidia enjoyed dramatic upside. But it’s also possible that investors will be rotating their portfolio to seek out the next big hit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf that’s you, below are intriguing ideas to consider for hottest tech stocks.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nA legacy tech giant, IBM (NYSE:IBM) used to be the talk of the town when the baby boomers dominated the market. Now, Big Blue has given way to other hipper ideas for hottest tech stocks. Still, I believe this old dog can learn new tricks. It’s been on the move in the past half-year period. And analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy, with the high-side price target reaching $179.\n\nPrimarily, what makes IBM an intriguing idea for hot tech stocks centers on its specialty in machine learning. Basically, ML is a component of artificial intelligence, fostering algorithms techniques for machines to learn from data. According to Statista, the ML market size will likely hit $204.3 billion by the end of this year. Further, the sector volume could land at $528.1 billion by 2030.\n\nAs an investment idea, I understand that IBM doesn’t get the juices flowing. However, investors should note that shares trade at a lowly forward earnings multiple of 16.22X. Also, its forward dividend yield stands at 4.1%, which is very generous for one of the hottest tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn everywhere, everything idea within the vast innovation ecosystem, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers a sensible idea for hot tech stocks. No, it’s not exciting. However, it more than held its own in 2023, beating out the performance of the Nasdaq Composite index. Analysts believe the solid run will continue this year, pegging shares a consensus strong buy. Also, the average price target lands at $424.36.\n\nFor me, MSFT is appealing because it has its hands on several innovative fields. However, if I had to pick one, it would be its aggressive investments in AI, particularly generative AI. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market size reached a valuation of $29 billion in 2022.\n\nFurther, the segment could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.5% to 2030. At the forecast culmination, the segment could be worth nearly $668 billion. And that’s not including other compelling business units such as Azure and its Office Software as a Service (SaaS) platform.\n\nFinally, MSFT isn’t exactly traded at a discount. However, it enjoys solid long-term revenue growth and consistent profitability. Thus, it’s one of the hot tech stocks to consider.\n\nLeidos (LDOS) Leidos (LDOS) logo on the side of an office building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormerly known as Science Applications International Corporation, Leidos (NYSE:LDOS) has its hands in several relevant businesses, including defense, aviation, information technology and biomedical research. Thus, it’s one of the great investments to consider for the long haul. However, it does have the advantage of being one of the hottest tech stocks. Analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $121.83 average price target.\n\nFundamentally, Leidos draws attention for its cybersecurity business. Per its website, the company is recognized as a sector leader across the federal government. Further, at the end of this year, the global cybersecurity market could print revenue of $183.1 billion. Plus, experts project that the sector will expand at a CAGR of 10.56%. If so, we’re talking a market volume of $273.6 billion by 2028.\n\nFinally, Leidos makes an enticing case for hot tech stocks to buy because of its attractive valuation. Currently, the market prices at LDOS at a forward earnings multiple of 14.11X, lower than the sector median 23.8X. Given the upward growth trajectory of cybersecurity along with its other relevancies, the discount appears credible.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) inherently draws attention for its massive social network. Cynically, META ranks among the hottest tech stocks thanks to leveraging a veritable data goldmine. However, the company has also transitioned to several innovative arenas. It performed quite well last year and analysts remain enthused, pegging shares a consensus strong buy. Also, the average price target lands at $391.57.\n\nOne of the compelling focus areas for Meta has been its investment in the metaverse. Now, I’m not going to say that I’m a huge fan of the concept. Nevertheless, the underlying virtual reality market should be huge. According to Mordor Intelligence, the VR market size reached a valuation of $54.24 billion last year. Further, the segment should expand at a CAGR of 24.74%, ultimately reaching $163.82 billion by 2028.\n\nTo be sure, with META marching toward the 200% up mark (it fell a bit short) in 2023, you’re not going to get a discount here. However, the company maintains a strong long-term revenue growth rate while staying consistently profitable. Thus, it’s a solid idea for hot tech stocks.\n\nCanaan (CAN) web browser showing Canaan (CAN) logo on website\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Jarretera\n\nMoving into the extremely speculative segment of the hottest tech stocks, investors that are willing to throw caution to the wind should take a look at Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN). As a specialist in blockchain mining hardware, CAN might be appealing to those who want to participate broadly in the cryptocurrency sector but don’t actually want to directly take the risk. Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $4.25 average price target.\n\nObviously, the narrative for Canaan revolves around how well cryptos perform in 2024. If the sector continues to build upon what materialized near the end of last year, CAN may fly higher. What makes the idea more tempting is that its market performance wasn’t really that impressive compared to its blockchain-mining peers. However, a once-ignored opportunity could easily transition to a blistering outperformer in the crypto paradigm.\n\nStill, caution is key. For example, it’s true that Canaan enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 37.6%, which is outstanding. Still, the problem is that the mining equipment specialist’s fortunes are heavily tied to crypto sentiment. So, just be careful how much exposure you have.\n\nD-Wave Quantum (QBTS) QBTS stock: Person holding mobile phone with logo of Canadian hardware company D-Wave Systems Inc. on screen in front of web page.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nAs the name suggests, D-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS) specializes in quantum computing. Per its public profile, D-Wave claims to be the world’s first company to sell computers that exploit quantum effects in their operations. It’s been incredibly choppy over the past 52 weeks. Nevertheless, analysts appreciate the opportunity, pegging shares a unanimous strong buy. Also, the average price target clocks in at $2.17.\n\nIn a nutshell, classical computers – no matter how fast they are – operate in a binary linearism. In order for a set of problems to be solved, the initial challenge must be addressed before the next obstacle can be engaged. Think about unlocking a lock by entering every possible combination. It would take a while. On the other hand, quantum computers can run multiple problem sets simultaneously due to the underlying weird nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nHere’s the bottom line. According to BCC Research, the sector may grow from $904.7 million last year to $6.5 billion by 2028. That would be a CAGR of 48.1%, which is astonishing. However, the risk is that QBTS trades for 12.62X trailing revenue, which is screaming high.\n\nAsensus Surgical (ASXC) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nA literal penny stock, you want to be supremely cautious with Asensus Surgical (NYSEAMERICAN:ASXC). Frankly, I’m hesitant to even naming this idea for the hottest tech stocks available. As you can see from its 52-week chart, ASXC is volatile as fudge, as the kids like to say. Still, the underlying surgical robotics specialty draws much interest. Analysts are split with a moderate buy rating. The average price target stands at $1.50, which is intense.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global surgical robots market size reached a valuation of $3.92 billion last year. Experts project that the sector may expand at a CAGR of 9.5% from 2024 to 2030. At the forecast culmination, the industry may generate annual revenue of $7.42 billion. For ASXC, the idea is to get a piece of the pie. With a market capitalization of less than $100 million, it may not need to grab much for shares to skyrocket.\n\nFrankly, whether it will or not requires a whole lot of faith. We’re talking the kind that led to Indiana Jones taking a step in that deep chasm, hoping that his foot would land on an invisible bridge. Shares trade at 13.84X trailing revenue so you really need to think about this one carefully before diving in.\n\nPenny Stocks\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "At this point, investors are back to looking for inflation-proof stocks to shield their portfolios. After closing 2023 on a bullish note, as an early Santa Claus rally sent markets back to all-time highs, we’re entering 2024 on a muted note. The trading year began with two consecutive down days, putting a damper on reinvigorated bullish enthusiasm and sowing unease among traders.\n\nA big pivot point for economic developments will be the holiday sales data. If we see renewed consumer enthusiasm and generally lower inflation, we can expect Fed policy to adjust accordingly. If there’s even a hint of danger flashing, though, then the Fed’s “higher for longer” regime will likely remain in effect.\n\nIn either case, uncertainty reigns. If you’re ready to deploy some New Year’s cash into the market but are nervous about growth stock prospects, these solid inflation-proof stocks offer a viable alternative.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinding better options than tech or healthcare stocks when investing for the long term is challenging. But, in many cases, both sectors combine volatility and risk with outsized gain potential. Unlike those speculative stocks, though, HealthTech firm Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is an inflation-proof stock offering continued growth opportunity—a rare combo. Despite facing some difficulties during the pandemic, the company has a strong showing in 2023.\n\nMost of Medtronic’s temporary performance decline came from cuts in elective and non-emergent surgeries rather than material economic factors. However, the situation is increasingly stabilized, and Medtronic is recovering rapidly. In its most recent earnings report, the company achieved a 5% year-over-year increase in revenue, and its management has raised its annual forecast.\n\nMedtronic’s growth potential comes from its unique position at the intersection of healthcare (an industry that continues to grow) and technology. For instance, the company collaborates with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop next-generation, AI-enabled diagnostic tools. Further reinforcing MDT’s inflation-proof stock status, it offers a 2.9% total yield, and despite bouncing back recently, shares remain undervalued.\n\nStory continues\n\nConagra Brands (CAG) Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campus\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nConagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) is a top player in the food industry, a well-known inflation-proof sector. Still, the food giant is consistently undervalued, mostly due to past (mis)management. But under current president and CEO Sean Connolly’s leadership, the inflation-proof stock is well on its way to turning around for good.\n\nCurrently, the company is trading at around 1.5x book value, a reasonable indicator of undervaluation in this case. The company has increasingly improved its margins in recent quarters. That stands as a testament that Connolly and the team can adapt to higher interest rates and retain consumers amid inflation. Better yet, the company is generating sufficient free cash flow to pay off $130 million of short-term debt, reducing interest expenses and providing shareholders with a $157 million dividend. That commitment to shareholders keeps Conagra’s longstanding quarterly dividend trend rolling.\n\nAddressing its short-term debt is a top priority for Connolly, and Conagra remains committed to delivering value to its shareholders. This stock offers a compelling combination of growth potential as it improves its financial position, inflation-proof qualities, and a stable income opportunity.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you don’t want to pick single inflation-proof stocks, you can always follow Warren Buffett’s lead by simply investing in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B).\n\nBerkshire Hathaway holds over 50 companies in its portfolio and invests in many more. These companies cover multiple inflation-proof industries, including transportation, energy, and staple consumer goods. Undoubtedly, investing in Berkshire Hathaway provides an easy way to diversify your investments and inflation-proof your portfolio without buying and betting on many individual stocks.\n\nInvesting in Berkshire Hathaway lets investors align with the Oracle of Omaha’s investment strategy and market outlook. For instance, Buffett’s skepticism caused him to divest his stake in Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and other underperforming stocks to build a strong cash position in 2023—a movie that may prove prescient. This internal “rebalancing” can serve as a shield for your portfolio against negative economic impacts. Simultaneously, you can benefit from Buffett’s expertise as he eventually deploys that cash in search of lucrative deals when companies face further challenges.\n\nInvesting in Berkshire Hathaway is the simplest way to follow smart money. Few investment managers have a track record as successful as Buffett and his team when selecting and managing companies. This solidifies Berkshire Hathaway’s position as a top inflation-proof stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "The EV sector has quickly evolved into a hotbed of investment opportunities, with EV stocks frequently outperforming market expectations. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long been synonymous with EV innovation, but the competition in the market has been intensifying impressively. These selections promise not only innovation but also a substantial upside, positioning themselves as compelling alternatives to the EV trailblazer. Moreover, with the likely rate cuts expected in 2024, growth stocks in the EV sphere should offer a robust upside over the long term.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), a Chinese electric vehicle powerhouse, continues to be a dominant player in the global EV race, positioning itself as a major challenger to Tesla. It has established itself as the world’s second-largest battery maker and with a diverse product line it boasts an incredibly attractive position. Moreover, BYD’s edge is not just in its product variety – its global footprint is equally significant.\n\nSetting itself apart, BYD emphasizes affordability without compromising quality. Additionally, its vehicles are priced competitively, offering budget-friendly alternatives to Tesla’s lineup. This pricing strategy is critical for BYD’s growing appeal, especially as the EV market expands and at a rapid pace. In 2023, BYD reported selling an impressive 3.02 million vehicles, a 61.9% increase year-over-year. Significantly, BYD’s international sales in December soared, more than tripling the previous year’s numbers. This achievement underscores BYD’s enviable global presence and its potential to thrive in the competitive EV landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto logo and store in downtown Lujiazui. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. Business and finance concept photo.\n\nSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is another top Chinese company that has effectively carved out a niche in the EV market with its unique electric SUVs offering both combustion and electric driving capabilities. Recent results have been amazing to say the least. In December, the company achieved a noteworthy milestone, delivering 50,353 vehicles, marking its ninth consecutive month of record-breaking sales. This achievement not only demonstrates the company’s powerful appeal but also underscores its operational excellence.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis surge brought its fourth-quarter deliveries to an impressive 131,805, a 184.6% bump compared to the previous year. The fact that Li Auto consistently shattered its monthly sales records for nine straight months speaks volumes over its market traction. This remarkable growth trajectory positions Li Auto as a strong player in the EV market. It’s an attractive long-term option for investors seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for EVs.\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) Autonomous Driving Stocks, A finger hovering over an \"autonomous drive\" button.\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV) offers an appealing investment avenue into the EV and autonomous technology sectors. With a moderate expense ratio of 0.7%, DRIV invests in companies at the forefront of autonomous vehicles, EVs and critical components like lithium and cobalt. Its portfolio includes major companies, such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) blending established tech giants with emerging EV market players.\n\nDespite a recent dip of 1.8% in value and a 7% decrease over six months, analysts from TipRanks project an encouraging 20% upside from current prices. This outlook is anchored in the growth and adoption of EVs and autonomous vehicle technology worldwide. Hence, for investors seeking exposure to this dynamic sector while maintaining a balanced risk profile, the ETF stands out as a diversified and potentially rewarding investment choice.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is the world’s leading lithium producer and a stock that usually makes the list of top battery EV stocks. Despite the recent dip in lithium prices, imperative for EV battery production, Albemarle stands out with its ability to effectively navigate commodity market fluctuations. Expert predictions of a looming lithium shortage by 2025 have bolstered the outlook for ALB stock, suggesting a potential upswing this year.\n\nIn the face of recent challenges, Albemarle has projected a robust 30% to 35% increase in sales for 2023, along with a $700 million in operating cash flow forecast, showcasing its readiness to surge ahead even with existing margin pressures. As the market anticipates a recovery in lithium prices, Albemarle is positioned remarkably well to efficiently capitalize on this trend, poised to deliver robust long-term growth.\n\nNio (NIO) NIO logo and the Nio's user center, NIO House.

EV stocks\n\nSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) is another top Chinese EV manufacturer that recently received a major boost, propelling its share price upward by double-digit margins. This surge in market confidence is attributed to a substantial $2.2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based CYVN Holdings. While some experts are bullish on the brand’s potential, citing its approach and market penetration, others remain skeptical.\n\nIn terms of performance, NIO’s recent vehicle delivery statistics underscore its powerful market presence. In December 2023, the company delivered 18,012 vehicles, marking a 13.9% bump year-over-year. This impressive figure includes 12,048 premium smart electric SUVs and 5,964 premium smart electric sedans, reflecting the brand’s strength in both segments of the EV market. Furthermore, NIO’s performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 was noteworthy, with the delivery of 50,045 vehicles representing a 25% increase compared to the prior year.\n\nWhile both the bullish and bearish cases for NIO present compelling arguments, investors with a tolerance for risk and a long-term perspective may find significant long-term reward in this innovative and rapidly evolving EV company.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen.

The company’s primary asset, the Thacker Pass project in the United States, is the biggest known lithium resource in the country. This project alone has an impressive after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion, promising an average annual EBITDA of $1.1 billion over a 40-year mine life.\n\nThe company’s prospects are further bolstered by a massive investment of $650 million from General Motors (NYSE:GM), including a 100% offtake agreement for the project’s first phase production. With these strong prospects and strategic relationships, Lithium Americas stands on the brink of a significant market revaluation, making it an attractive option for investors eyeing long-term gains among EV stocks.\n\nLi-Cycle Holdings (LICY) Person holding cellphone with logo of battery recycling company Li-Cycle Corp.(LICY) on screen in front of business webpage.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi-Cycle Holdings (NYSE:LICY), a leading North American lithium-ion battery recycler, continues to take significant strides in the global recycling sphere. The company’s recent inauguration of its first processing line in Germany, with another slated for later in the year, marks a pivotal step in its expansion. Each primary line at this facility can recycle up to 10,000 tonnes of battery material annually. With plans to add an additional 10,000 tons, the facility is on track to reach an impressive 30,000 tons per year.\n\nLi-Cycle’s vision extends beyond the Europe region, with a vigorous network spanning North America and Asia. Furthermore, in a strong boost to its operations, the U.S. Department of Energy has conditionally agreed to extend a $375 million loan to Li-Cycle to finance its North American lithium-ion battery (LIB) resource recovery facility.\n\nFor investors optimistic about the future of recycling and sustainable resource management, these temporary hurdles present an attractive buying opportunity. As the demand for battery materials grows, Li-Cycle’s strategic positioning and expanding capacity make it a compelling choice in EV stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Why Wall Street is cooling on Apple stock",
        "content": "The brightest light on Wall Street is dimmer at the start of 2024.\n\nApple (AAPL) the most valuable company on the market, has endured a bruising run in the first days of the new year. The iPhone maker, which commands about 7% of the weight of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index, steering the fate of investor portfolios, drew two stock downgrades this week, pulling shares down more than 5% and raising concerns about weakening iPhone demand.\n\nBarclays struck the first blow. Analysts there cut Apple's rating to underweight and dropped their price target to $160, representing what was a roughly 17% stock price drop for the tech giant from last year.\n\n\"We rate Apple Under Weight as questions persist about the deterioration of iPhone upgrade demand with rising competition in the premium smartphone segment,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe follow up punch landed Thursday, when analysts at Piper Sandler downgraded their rating on Apple's stock to neutral from overweight and sliced their price target by $15 to $205. Apple shares were trading hands at around $182 as of Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"We are concerned about handset inventories entering into 1H24 and also feel that growth rates have peaked for unit sales,\" said lead analyst Harsh Kumar in a note to clients. \"Deteriorating macro environment in China could also weigh on handset business.\"\n\nThe percentage of analysts with a bullish rating on the stock is at a three-year low, according to Bloomberg data. Apple CEO Tim Cook and his leadership team have played up the growth of the company's services segment. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)\n\nApple's iPhone revenue sank about $5 billion in 2023 from the year prior. The flagship iPhone accounts for roughly half the company’s total revenue. Sales of Macs, iPads, and wearables also declined, as rising inflation and interest rates pressured consumers.\n\nBut bullish analysts focus on Apple's growing services businesses, which swelled from $78 billion in 2022 to $85 billion in 2023. In the most recent quarter revenue from services ballooned by almost 20% compared to the same period the year before. Apple's enormous user base and the strength of its services is a crucial component of more optimistic readings on the company's future. Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives pin the value of Apple's services business as high as $1.6 trillion and predict that Cupertino will become the first $4 trillion company by the end of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nSkeptical observers, however, see heightened risks even in Apple's most promising segment. Barclays noted that services might attract more regulatory scrutiny. Investigations into the app store could intensify, especially as other tech giants brace for a wave of significant antitrust rulings this year. How Big Tech figures into the US presidential election and how aggressive the next administration will pursue competition enforcement is another major factor for tech stocks.\n\nApple's lucrative agreement to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser, which is estimated to bring in billions of dollars to its services business, could also be under threat. Closing arguments for the Department of Justice's antitrust case against the search giant are scheduled for the Spring.\n\nApple's dimming prospects among some analysts coincides with a stock performance that lags behind other members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAll the names in the elite, tech-centric group handily beat out the benchmark S&P 500 index. But Apple claimed the lowest position, rising roughly 50% in 2023. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but is notable compared to the staggering gains of Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META), up 239% and 194%, respectively, or even Microsoft's (MSFT) more modest 57% rise. The Nasdaq 100's (^NDX) increase of 54% managed to edge out Apple too.\n\nWhere much of the tech world and even players outside it have scrambled to get in on the AI hype — releasing products, announcing new ventures or simply reciting the words \"AI\" — Apple CEO Tim Cook has taken a more subtle approach. That too may have played a factor in the market's cooling reception.\n\nIn recent earnings calls, Cook has explained that AI is already integrated into the Apple consumer experience. It's just that the company doesn't call out the technologies explicitly, as if it were a marketing gimmick, but relies instead on weaving AI into its products and focusing on the customer benefit. In another rhetorical move that appeared to be gently critical of other tech leaders, Cook said the company tends to unveil new technologies when they are ready for users. And not before.\n\nIf there is a consumer tech company defined by how its products make users feel — for the vibes rather than the intricacies of its software, it's Apple. So not showboating about whats coming in the AI development cycle has its benefits.\n\nBut a more pessimistic interpretation is that as rivals like Microsoft and Meta lean into their large language models, framing generative AI as tech's next great frontier, Apple is getting left behind. And most of us already have phones.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "(Recasts, adds CEO quotes, background)\n\nBy Krystal Hu and Pritam Biswas\n\nJan 4 (Reuters) - Search startup Perplexity AI has raised $73.6 million from a group of investors including Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the latest example of investors hunting for AI startups that challenge incumbents.\n\nThe round was led by venture capital firm IVP and valued the company at about $520 million, according to the company. NEA, NVIDIA, Databricks, and Bessemer Venture Partners also participated in the round.\n\nPerplexity's search tools enable users to get instant answers to questions with sources and citations. It is powered by a variety of large language models (LLMs) that can sum up and generate information, from OpenAI to Meta's open-source model Llama.\n\nSan Francisco, California-based Perplexity AI, which raised $25.6 million in March last year in a round led by NEA, said it has served more than 500 million queries in 2023 while spending few marketing dollars.\n\nThe company plans to use the funding to hire and build the products. It now has 38 people and plans to reach about 60 by the end of this year.\n\nIts website and mobile web had 45 million visits in December, up from 2.2 million when the service became available in December 2022, according to Similarweb data.\n\nDespite its fast growth, the company, which is not profitable and generates single-digit million revenue annually, is a moonshot in the online search market where Google has about 90% market share.\n\nMicrosoft, the backer of OpenAI, has been integrating AI into search engine Bing in the past year but so far failed to take major market share away from Google.\n\nAravind Srinivas, chief executive at Perplexity, said the startup's advantage lies in its focus and ability to fine-tune a variety of top-performing AI models instead of locking into one.\n\n\"Google is going to be viewed as something that's legacy and old, and Perplexity will be viewed as something that's the next generation and future,\" said Srinivas.

        "content": "T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS recently announced that it has joined forces with SpaceX to launch Starlink satellites with Direct-to-Cell services in the United States. Starlink's Direct-to-Cell technology ensures dependable text, voice and data services for LTE phones worldwide, even in regions where ground network infrastructure is limited. This satellite-to-cellular service will ensure complete coverage almost anywhere a person can see the sky, with no additional hardware or other applications required.\r\n\r\nT-Mobile is a major player in the SpaceX global partner ecosystem, sharing a common vision of achieving universal coverage. T-Mobile offers the lowest multi-server latency, which significantly reduces network delays and accelerates application response times. It offers one of the fastest connectivity with a consistent network speed. Despite challenges such as geographical obstacles, land restrictions and various other factors hindering infrastructure development, the company is taking ample initiatives to extend coverage in remote locations where terrestrial network coverage is non-existent.\r\n\r\nIntegrating Starlink’s Direct-to-Cell capabilities with its industry-leading wireless network will mitigate the issues of mobile dead zones where legacy cell signals cannot reach. It will also eliminate the need for high-end satellite phones.\r\n\r\nThe first batch of satellites was launched by SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and are now deployed in low earth orbit. Field testing by pairing SpaceX's cutting-edge satellite constellation and TMUS’ wireless network for the cell services is expected to commence soon.

Voice, data and IoT services are likely to be available in upcoming years.\r\n\r\nDespite rapid 5G network expansion, over half a million soiree miles across the country remain out of network coverage from any service provider. Starlink’s technology will help connect a significant number of smartphones already using T-Mobile's network. The introduction of these features will be a lucrative addition to T-Mobile’s portfolio offerings and will likely give a substantial competitive advantage in the U.S. wireless industry.\r\n\r\nThe company’s 5G network covers more than 330 million people in the country.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market witnessed an impressive turnaround in 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency worldwide, soared 157% last year. Other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) also saw massive price hikes.\n\nThe space is likely to remain buoyant in 2024. U.S. stock markets have soared amid a clear indication from the Fed’s December FOMC meeting that the current interest rate hike cycle, which elevated the Fed fund rate to a 22-year high of 5.25-5.50% from 0-0.25% in March 2022, has finally ended. Moreover, the December FOMC meeting dot-plot showed that on average, Fed officials are expecting at least three rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2024.\n\nA lower interest rate regime will be very helpful for high-growth sectors like technology and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors.\n\nSpeculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission is set to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has also raised investors’ optimism. The agency is expected to respond to the application filed by ARK Investments and 21Shares by Jan 10, while financial bigwig BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK) proposal is expected to be addressed by Mar 15.\n\nMoreover, the next Bitcoin Halving will occur in the first half of 2024. When a halving occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five crypto-centric stocks with strong potential for 2024.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the NVDA stock usually soars on a booming crypto market. This is because GPUs are pivotal to data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 62% (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next-year earnings has improved 1% over the past 30 days. NVDA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. COIN provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy in the United States and internationally. COIN offers the primary financial account in the crypto space for consumers, a marketplace with a pool of liquidity for transacting in crypto assets for institutions; and technology and services that enable developers to build crypto-based applications and securely accept crypto assets as payment.\n\nCoinbase Global has an expected earnings growth rate of 30.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.7% over the past 30 days. COIN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nBlock Inc. SQ is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants and is the parent company of Square and Cash App. The users of Cash App can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin. In addition, SQ’s decentralized tbd platform allows developers to build decentralized finance applications to run on programmable blockchains. SQ is also one of the largest Bitcoin investors.\n\nBlock has an expected earnings growth rate of 53.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.5% over the past 60 days. SQ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInteractive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR’s commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.7% over the past 90 days. IBKR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nCME Group Inc.’s CME options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro BTC and ETH futures contracts.\n\nCME Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 3.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the past 30 days. CME currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of the abovementioned stocks in the past three months.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to give the global economy a big boost in the long run, with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimating that this technology could contribute a whopping $15.7 trillion, or 14%, to the global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.\n\nPwC points out that AI-focused economic gains will be driven by an improvement in productivity, as well as new products that are likely to boost consumer demand. Not surprisingly, investors have been buying AI stocks hand over fist over the past year to take advantage of this huge end-market opportunity.\n\nMore importantly, the massive economic potential of AI suggests that buying and holding solid AI stocks for a really long time could give investors impressive returns, as they will be able to benefit from the power of compounding while capitalizing on a rapidly growing market.\n\nThat's why if you have investible cash of $200,000 after paying your bills, clearing high-interest loans, and saving enough for bad times, it may be a good idea to put that money into shares of both Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). These stocks could help you become a millionaire, or at least get close to that milestone, as part of a diversified portfolio. Let's see how.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has seen a big surge in demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) thanks to AI, leading to eye-popping growth in the company's revenue and earnings in recent quarters. The market has rewarded Nvidia's impressive growth with solid gains, which explains how the stock would have turned a $200,000 investment into $659,000 in the past year. NVDA Chart\n\nHowever, a closer look at Nvidia's AI-related opportunity indicates that the company is just getting started. Market research provider IDTechEx estimates that the market for AI chips could generate $258 billion in annual revenue in 2033, growing at an annual rate of 24% over the next decade.\n\nNvidia's market share of more than 80% in AI chips means that it is in a prime position to make the most of this multibillion-dollar market opportunity. The company's revenue tripled year over year in the last reported quarter to $18.1 billion as its data center revenue shot up 279% to $14.5 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is taking steps to ensure that it maintains its dominant position in this market by accelerating its product roadmap and increasing chip supply, which could help ensure robust growth in the years to come.\n\nAssuming Nvidia manages to control even 50% of the AI chip market in a decade, its data center revenue could jump to almost $130 billion based on IDTechEx's estimate of the size of this market in 2033. That would be a huge jump over the $15 billion revenue Nvidia's data center business generated in fiscal 2023.\n\nThere are also other catalysts that could send the company's top and bottom lines soaring in the long run, such as the AI-enabled personal computer (PC) market, cloud gaming, digital twins, and automotive. This explains why Nvidia's earnings are expected to clock annual growth of 102% over the next five years, up significantly from the 48% annual earnings growth it clocked in the last five years.\n\nA $200,000 investment made in Nvidia stock five years ago would now be worth almost $2.9 million. Given that the company is expected to deliver even faster earnings growth over the next five years, there is a chance that it may be able to replicate its sizzling rally, deliver outstanding returns to investors, and even help them become millionaires.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nSnowflake provides a cloud-based data platform that gives customers access to multiple functions such as data warehousing, data lakes, data science, data engineering, and secure sharing on a single interface. You may be wondering how Snowflake is going to benefit from the AI boom, but the cloud-based services that Snowflake provides could witness a jump in adoption thanks to AI.\n\nThat's because training large language models (LLMs) requires access to massive amounts of data. For example, the amount of data needed to train ChatGPT and GPT-4 LLMs reportedly exceeded 45 terabytes (TB). As a result, having access to high-quality data for training LLMs is crucial. This is where Snowflake steps in.\n\nIn June 2023, Nvidia announced that it was partnering with Snowflake to allow businesses to \"create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud.\" The ability of enterprises to create custom LLMs using their own data to speed up their business processes in a secure environment could open up a new growth opportunity for Snowflake.\n\nA survey of more than 300 businesses and AI experts by enterprise AI company Expert.AI in April 2023 revealed that almost 40% of the respondents were planning to build custom enterprise LLMs. This illustrates why demand for Snowflake's data platform could increase, especially considering that it has taken steps to help enterprises build LLMs in a cost-effective manner with the Snowflake Cortex platform.\n\nSnowflake customers who stored their data on the company's platform can use Cortex, a fully managed offering, to extract information from unstructured data, translate text, summarize documents, and build custom applications quickly. Enterprises are getting access to this facility without having to invest in expensive hardware, which is all the more reason why the demand for Snowflake's offerings could increase.\n\nNot surprisingly, Snowflake expects its addressable market to increase rapidly in the long run. The company was sitting on a total addressable market (TAM) worth $140 billion in 2022. It expects this market to more than double to $290 billion in 2027. It is worth noting that Snowflake has generated $2.6 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, so it is scratching the surface of a huge opportunity.\n\nThe company is expected to finish the current fiscal year with $2.8 billion in revenue, up 35% from the prior year. Snowflake's earnings are forecast to more than triple in fiscal 2024 to $0.80 per share. As the following chart shows, Snowflake's top and bottom lines could keep heading higher in the next couple of fiscal years as well. SNOW Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nWhat's more, analysts are forecasting Snowflake's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 66% over the next five years. At this pace, the company's earnings could hit $10 per share in fiscal 2029. Multiplying the projected earnings with the Nasdaq-100 index's (which is used as a proxy for tech stocks) price-to-earnings ratio of 30 points toward a stock price of $300, which would be a 58% jump from current levels.\n\nHowever, Snowflake is trading at 175 times forward earnings right now. It could maintain a premium valuation in five years thanks to its impressive growth and a new catalyst in the form of AI. Investors aiming at becoming millionaires can team their Snowflake investment with an investment in Nvidia, both of which look like solid picks in a diversified portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Party like it's 1999: That's what many stocks in the Nasdaq-100 did in 2023. The index delivered its biggest gains since the end of the 20th century, skyrocketing nearly 54%.\n\nThe sizzling momentum could fade for some Nasdaq stocks. Others, though, could keep the good times rolling, and some laggards could rebound, based on analysts' projections. Here are three Nasdaq-100 stocks Wall Street thinks will soar another 29% or more in 2024.\n\n1. Warner Bros. Discovery\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery(NASDAQ: WBD) started 2023 with a bang, with its shares jumping as much as 68% by late February. Although the stock subsequently gave up much of those early gains, it still ended the year up 20%.\n\nSeveral analysts look for Warner Bros. Discovery to bounce back in 2024. The average 12-month price target is 36% above the company's current share price.\n\nThe big story for Warner Bros. Discovery right now is its discussions about a potential merger with Paramount Global. A combination of the two companies would create an entertainment giant but would also increase Warner Bros. Discovery's debt load.\n\nWith Warner's total debt already approaching $45 billion, it's understandable why investors aren't exactly enamored with the idea of a merger with Paramount. Should a deal be announced, we could see some revisions to Wall Street's price targets.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) ranked as the hottest Nasdaq-100 stock last year. Shares of the chipmaker more than tripled on surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nWall Street doesn't expect Nvidia to keep up that torrid pace in 2024. But analysts nonetheless anticipate another great performance. The consensus 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of 33%.\n\nThe boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) shows no signs of ending anytime soon. That should translate into sustained demand for Nvidia's GPUs, which are widely viewed as the gold standard for powering AI apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's one potential fly in the ointment, though. Rivals including Advanced Micro Devices and customers such as Alphabet's Google Cloud are rolling out their own powerful AI chips. Nvidia's almost total dominance of the market might come to an end in the not-too-distant future.\n\n3. PayPal Holdings\n\nNot every Nasdaq-100 stock was a solid winner in 2023. PayPal Holdings' (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares sank nearly 14% last year after plunging 62% in 2022.\n\nThe fintech pioneer could have a light at the end of the tunnel, though, if Wall Street is right. The average analysts' 12-month price target for PayPal is more than 29% above the current share price.\n\nDespite the dismal stock performance in recent years, PayPal's underlying business appears to be in pretty good shape. The company's net revenue rose 8% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted earnings per share soared 20%. Total payment volume jumped 15%.\n\nThere's still uncertainty for PayPal, though. The company has a new leadership team. Competition in the digital payments market is intensifying. Its business loans portfolio has deteriorated.\n\nBut with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of only 0.51, PayPal's valuation looks quite attractive and reflects analysts' expectations of more robust growth in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) needs little introduction.\n\nThe iPhone maker has built an unrivaled consumer tech ecosystem, selling high-priced devices and related high-margin services like the App Store and Apple Pay. Its business model and reputation for quality products have allowed Apple to generate enormous profits and made it the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap today of about $2.9 trillion. With modest growth, the company could be worth $5 trillion by 2030.\n\nHowever, just because Apple is the most valuable company in the world today doesn't mean it will always be. Just ask ExxonMobil, General Electric, and IBM, all of which have fallen sharply from their earlier positions as the most valuable companies in the country.\n\nWhile Apple still appears to be in great shape, a number of companies have the potential to move past it by 2030. Let's take a look at three of them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nOf all the companies that could top Apple in market cap by 2030, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has the best chance of doing so. In fact, it's already knocking on the door with a market cap of $2.76 trillion, just 5% smaller than Apple.\n\nBut that's not the only reason why Microsoft could reclaim the title of the world's most valuable company. It is on the cutting edge of the artificial intelligence (AI) business thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, and it's in the process of incorporating generative AI technologies across its portfolio of products, including its Azure cloud infrastructure business, Office software suite, and Bing search engine.\n\nMicrosoft Azure is also growing faster than rivals like Amazon Web Services, and the company has a history of making smart acquisitions under CEO Satya Nadella, including Linkedin, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard.\n\nFinally, Microsoft is more diversified than Apple and its fellow tech giants, making it more resistant to recessions and better able to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the breakout star of 2023. The company's AI chips have been in high demand as cloud infrastructure companies, start-ups, and other tech companies look to build out their capacity to run complex generative AI models.\n\nNvidia's revenue tripled year over year in the third quarter, and it has built out a commanding lead in artificial intelligence (AI) chips and components. In fact, there's a shortage of the kind of graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators that Nvidia produces.\n\nDemand for generative AI components and infrastructure seems set to explode as many tech CEOs expect generative AI to be revolutionary, and that could fuel Nvidia's growth over the coming years.\n\nCurrently, the company enjoys a large competitive advantage in AI chips with a profit margin above 50%, which could enable the company to grow from $1 trillion to $5 trillion by 2030, potentially topping Apple by then.\n\n3. Tesla\n\nFinally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has a chance to exceed Apple's market cap in the next six years.\n\nIt has already disrupted the auto sector once by proving that electric vehicles (EVs) can be a profitable business, and it essentially took the concept mainstream. Now, it has a chance of disrupting the sector again with autonomous vehicle technology and robotaxis. Tesla bulls like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood expect the company to deploy a fleet of robotaxis in the coming years, and predict that autonomous vehicles will eventually produce the majority of its revenue.\n\nThat could still be several years away, but Tesla's track record and its commitment to innovation in areas like its autonomous robot, Optimus, give the stock significant upside potential. For Tesla to reach $5 trillion in market cap, it would have to grow roughly six times larger, but that's as much as investors such as Wood expect it to appreciate.\n\nIf Tesla can pull off the pivot to autonomous vehicles, its stock could skyrocket from here. While that may seem impossible, Tesla has shown its ability to overcome long odds in the past, and it could do it again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Stock Picks 2024: 7 Trailblazers Using AI to Revolutionize Their Industries",
        "content": "When you think about stock picks for 2024 related to artificial intelligence, the first name that likely comes to mind is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). If not NVDA, then pure-play technology companies rise to the forefront for obvious reasons. However, the beauty of digital intelligence is that the innovation is utilitarian, empowering practically all industries to benefit.\n\nTo put this into a numeric context, Grand View Research estimates that the global AI market size reached a valuation of $136.55 billion in 2022. Further, experts project that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. At the forecast culmination point, the industry may be worth more than $1.81 trillion.\n\nThat’s one of the key reasons to consider AI stocks for 2024. Essentially, the industry continues to grow, both in terms of the market value and for improving efficiencies and conveniences. Therefore, it’s possible that the projected CAGR could be understated. Any industry that benefits from advanced analytics – again, practically every sector – should find value with AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn that note, below is a broad range of stock picks for 2024.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the start of the new year signaling tax day quickly approaching, tax software specialist Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) offers plenty of relevance as one of the stock picks for 2024. Analysts agree, rating shares a consensus strong buy with an average price target of $640. Admittedly, that’s not that much growth. However, the high-side target – issued by Susquehanna on Dec. 15 – sees INTU hitting $700.\n\nFor Intuit, I’m personally excited about how the evolution of AI can effectively forward the business of tax preparation. As you know, taxes can be incredibly convoluted, involving myriad laws and procedures. Generative AI applications can give customers quick and clear answers. That’s really where Intuit is headed with its financial assistant platform. In my opinion, INTU makes a strong case for AI stocks for 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the financials, I admit that with shares trading at nearly 66X trailing-year earnings, that’s not exactly a discount. And even the forward multiple of almost 37X isn’t enticing. However, the growth of the gig economy – and the subsequent tax complexities that this trend entails – should be a solid catalyst.\n\nBoston Scientific (BSX) a zoom-in on the Boston Scientific logo (BSX) on a web page\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA biomedical and biotechnology engineering firm, Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) manufactures medical devices used in international medical specialties, including radiology and cardiology. It’s easily one of the relevant stock picks for 2024 just on its own without getting into the AI component. Analysts assign shares as a consensus strong buy with a $62.76 average price target. The high-side target clocks in at $77.\n\nOne of the more exciting arenas for digital intelligence centers on the broader medical field. For BSX specifically, it utilizes AI for medical image analyses. In addition, the company is leveraging the innovation for other functionalities within medtech, thus enhancing patient care. According to one report, the global AI healthcare market could expand at a CAGR of 40.2% to hit $173.55 billion by 2029.\n\nAs with Intuit above, BSX isn’t exactly trading at a discount with a trailing-year multiple of 70.54X. To be blunt, the company could also use some operational improvements. That said, we’re in the early innings of the AI revolution. With compelling sector growth figures, BSX ranks among the top AI stocks for 2024.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational health insurance and services firm, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) offers investors seeking broad pertinence a viable idea for stock picks for 2024. Its 52-week return only comes in at 4%. However, recent sessions have demonstrated upward mobility. Analysts give it the nod, rating shares a consensus strong buy with a $589.75 average price target. The max price forecast lands at $660.\n\nFundamentally, UnitedHealth applies digital intelligence to analyze medical data for risk assessment. As well, it uses the protocol for disease prediction and personalized healthcare plans. On surface level, UNH appears as one of the top AI stocks for 2024. However, the issue has aroused controversy.\n\nSpecifically, Reuters reported that a lawsuit claims UnitedHealth’s AI wrongfully denied elderly extended care. I don’t want to mention a bum note but I’d be remiss not to. Here’s the thing, though. If you’re looking at the angle from a long-term perspective, once the kinks are addressed, UNH stands to be powerfully relevant.\n\nNo, it’s not discounted either. However, with the subsector’s massive projected growth, UNH appears a solid investment.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAn energy specialist, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a green powerhouse, yielding about 58 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity per its public profile. True, NEE lost about 27% of its equity value in the trailing 52 weeks. Still, it’s been on the move recently. Analysts peg shares a consensus moderate buy with an average price target of $67.75. The max target jumps to $84.\n\nPrimarily, NextEra leverages digital intelligence for its smart grid protocol. Per its website, the company leverages big data analytics to help maintain grid reliability. By itself, the underlying advancement offers a significant growth opportunity. For instance, Statista points out that smart grid tech reached a valuation of nearly $50 billion in 2022. By 2028, the segment could be worth $130 billion, representing a CAGR of 17.4%.\n\nTo be sure, with NEE trading at 16.27X trailing-year earnings, it’s not exactly a sterling discount. However, compared to previous quarters’ triple-digit multiples, NextEra has been relatively de-risked. Thus, it could be one of the stock picks for 2024.\n\nWyndham Hotels & Resorts (WH) A blue sign says Wyndham Hotels & Resorts in front of red and purple flowers\n\nSource: Mihai_Andritoiu / Shutterstock\n\nBased in New Jersey, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:WH) represents one of the largest hotel franchisors in the world. Admittedly, WH has been choppy throughout 2023. Still, it managed to gain nearly 15% in the trailing 52 weeks. It’s one of the stock picks for 2024 if you anticipate a stabilized economy this year. Analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with an $88.57 price target.\n\nIf any enterprise can benefit from digital intelligence, it’s a hotel. With a challenging economic backdrop, the lodging industry needs to get smart. Fortunately, Wyndham is on the ball, partnering with Canary Technologies to power the hotel’s new AI-enabled guest engagement platform. It will be deployed at more than 6,000 U.S. and Canadian locations. That makes it one of the largest rollouts of guest-facing AI tech in hospitality.\n\nFinancially, Wyndham could use some work, I’m not going to shy away from this point. However, if the Federal Reserve goes through with interest rate cuts and achieves a soft landing for the economy, the boosted sentiment could lift the hospitality sector.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nA name that’s synonymous with the big-box retail business, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) may be a love-it-and-hate-it name for many. Still, the one-stop-shop profile along with its everyday low pricing business model makes WMT one of the stock picks for 2024, even without mentioning AI. Unsurprisingly, analysts agree, pegging shares a consensus strong buy with an average price target of $180.79, implying almost 14% upside.\n\nWith the retail business, it’s all about giving your customers what they want, when they want it. Notably, then, Walmart introduced its AI-powered inventory system. By marrying AI and machine learning, the company was able to deliver a seamless shopping experience. Essentially, the broader system can predict shopper behaviors and other data analytics, matching the optimum inventory for in-demand products. Such protocols boost revenue while mitigating costs.\n\nFinancially, WMT is not really traded at a discount to forward earnings with a multiple of almost 23X. That said, the point here is about consistent revenue growth and annual profitability. For that, WMT ranks among the stock picks for 2024.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn icon in the automotive world, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is synonymous with American muscle. However, these days, it’s moving aggressively into electric vehicles. As such, it ranks among the stock picks for 2024 for leveraging digital intelligence. Analysts anticipate good tidings, rating shares a moderate buy with an average target of $45.91. That implies upside of over 27%, the highest average on this list.\n\nAs with any other enterprise broadly involved in the manufacturing space, General Motors utilizes AI via robotic automation. From tasks like welding, painting and assembly, machines can simply perform a more consistent job compared to humans. Further, the company uses digital intelligence through its OnStar virtual assistant. Through advanced, intent-recognition algorithms, customers can receive immediate help. And as always, human advisors jump in during emergencies or complex customer service needs.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, GM makes a great case for AI stocks for 2024 because of its lowly forward earnings multiple of 4.63X. That might seem like a value trap. However, the combo of possible low interest rates and EV/combustion flexibility makes the discount more credible.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street: 2024 Is The Year Of The Pivot",
        "content": "U.S. and European equity markets have kicked off the new year on the backfoot, with both pulling back slightly on the second trading day of 2024 from 2023 record high closes.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down 60 points to 4,714 from its 2023 close at 1130 hrs ET on Wednesday while the Stoxx Europe 600 was also down marginally. Yields on 10-year US bonds and German bunds have also started creeping up, with the U.S. rate quoted at 3.956% as money markets wagered on the Federal Reserve cutting rates by fewer than 150 basis points in 2024.\n\nThankfully, the U.S. energy sector has started the year on a more positive note, with the sector’s benchmark Energy Select Sector Fund (XLE) up 2.1% in the first two trading days and Brent and WTI gaining over 3% on Wednesday.\n\nGrowing tensions in the  Middle East have worsened fears of oil supply disruptions after an Iranian warship entered the Red Sea and raised the specter of the conflict spilling over into the region.\n\nThe markets remain a bit edgy because of the uncertainty surrounding precisely when the Federal will start cutting rates, and also because the Fed has cautioned about the lingering possibility of a mild recession.\n\nMarket action suggests there’s an outside chance of a 25-basis-point cut at just 12.9% in January, but a much bigger 87.1% chance that the central bank will leave rates unchanged when it releases its December meeting minutes on Wednesday at 1400 hrs ET. Fed officials held the policy interest rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range at their meeting in mid-December, but signaled they would cut rates by at least 75 basis points in the current year as inflation steadily declines to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nRelated: Oil Gains Over 3% On Libya, OPEC and Middle East Escalation\n\nThat said, equity markets remain largely bullish with Principal Financial Group predicting that 2024 is setting up to be the \"year of the pivot.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n“Markets surprised to the upside in 2023, despite a host of challenges, and fought off a widely expected recession to finish the year near record highs. Looking ahead to 2024, the market rebound, combined with the Federal Reserve’s rate pause, has set the stage for a long-anticipated pivot toward rate cuts,” Principal said in an investor note.\n\nIn other words, investors are looking forward to further gains in the stock markets in 2024. The U.S. market returned just under 25% while its European peer gained 13% in 2023 amid optimism that central banks will return to a rate cut regime. Supporting the optimistic market viewpoint is the fact that headline inflation decelerated to 3.1% in November, unemployment has declined to 3.7%  while 2023 GDP growth could potentially clock in at 2.6% based on the Federal Reserve’s latest projections.\n\nSource: J.P. Morgan\n\nBut it’s not just Wall Street that’s feeling upbeat about the new year. The American Association of Individual Investors has reported an underlying shift towards a bullish position with many bearish investor viewpoints now in the rearview mirror.\n\nAccording to a year-end sentiment survey put together by the organization, 46.3% of investors are bullish on the broader market; 25.1% hold a bearish stance while 28.6% remain neutral. While the majority of investors are still either bearish or neutral, it’s important to note that the sentiment has shifted dramatically over the past two months considering that only 24.3% of individuals were bullish while 50.3% looked at the market from a bearish lens when the survey was carried out on Nov. 1.\n\nHistorical precedent also seems to favor the bulls.\n\nOn Monday, Ned Davis Research noted that the S&P 500 sat less than 1% from its all-time trading high of 4,818 that it hit on Jan. 3, 2022. The analysts have noted that the gap between those two peaks is the sixth longest between record highs, and such lengthy gaps tend to be followed by a period of outperformance.\n\n“There have been 14 cases of the S&P 500 going at least one year without an all-time high. After the record has been eclipsed, the S&P 500 has outperformed its long-term average one-, three-, six-, and 12-months later. One-month returns are not quite as strong (up 71% of the time by a median of 1.8%), suggesting a short-term overbought condition. One year later, the index has risen 13 out of 14 times by a median of 13.4%. A new high after a long stretch often marks a new stage of the bull market rather than its conclusion,’’ the analysts have noted.\n\nJanuary Selloff For Megacap Tech Stocks\n\nBut not all corners of the market are expected to remain hale and hearty; at least not in the early innings of the year. Bank of America has warned about a January \"rout\" in megacap tech stocks, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp.(NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in danger of underperforming.\n\n\"Crowding risk in the leaders of 2023 has been cited by many (including ourselves) as a key risk in 2024. In particular, year-end 'window dressing' may have pushed active funds into big Tech leaders, but these stocks could be used as a source of funds if a hard landing is avoided and leadership broadens beyond secular growth stocks,\" BofA equity strategist Savita Subramanian has said in a note.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nArgentina’s New President Is Looking To Shake Up Its Oil Industry The 11 States Leading America’s Oil Production Boom What Will Influence Oil Prices in 2024?\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com",

        "title": "Why Arista Networks could be a top tech pick: Analyst",
        "content": "The tech sector dominated markets in 2023, driven by the Magnificent Seven stocks and endless talks about AI. Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the seven that more than exceeded expectations, but could there be some new contenders for top tech stocks?\n\nArgus Director of Research Jim Kelleher joins Yahoo Finance to discuss some of the top tech stocks that investors should keep an eye on, including Arista Networks (ANET).\n\nKelleher points to Arista's business model, particularly its data centers, as a key factor in his choice\n\n\"They're truly the first real cloud-based networking company. They send to serve what they call cloud titans which would mean Google Cloud (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), AWS or Amazon (AMZN),\" Kelleher says. \"So, they do serve that vertical which is a big part of their business, but they also serve enterprise customers and pushing into smaller enterprises and pushing up into the carrier space.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Jim, there's another name I want to ask you about, that is not one, even though it's a big company, it's not one that we talk about as often. And it's Arista Networks. Also one of your picks here, and one that you think is going to benefit from the continued AI boom. This like NVIDIA had a good year last year, not quite as good, but it did almost double. So where does it fit into that whole ecosystem?\n\nJIM KELLEHER: Well, so, it's just a great business they are in anyway, connecting data centers. We look at, we look at the massive amount of computing power needed but all that information, all that data needs to traverse from data center to its ultimate destination. So you need networking elements. They're truly the first real cloud-based networking company and they tend to serve what they call cloud Titans, which would mean basically Google Cloud, Microsoft, Azure, AWS, or Amazon.\n\nSo they do serve that vertical, which is a big part of their business, but they also serve large enterprise customers, and they're pushing into smaller enterprises, and they're pushing up into the carrier space. So they originally guided that after a great 2022, their cloud business would be down in 2023. And then, of course, here comes ChatGPT at the end of 2022, and then gathering momentum through the year. And everyone wanting to be in on the gold rush. So their cloud business related specifically to generative AI has really taken off.\n\nAnd they're another one where the sky is the limit, until we see how this business really shapes out. But because it is so early in the generative AI delivered as a cloud service day, we're not sure how big it's going to be. But we will see, and we certainly think Arista, in the same way that NVIDIA is uniquely positioned to drive things in terms of fueling large language models, we think Arista is uniquely positioned to deliver generative AI across the networking element.",

        "content": "While the idea of plant-based food may not seem appetizing, its potential profits could be.\n\nIn fact, by 2027, according to Research and Markets, the global plant-based food market could grow to about $75 billion by 2028 from $41.06 billion in 2022. All thanks to growing interest in veganism, healthy living, and environmental issues, which could be a big catalyst for the three plant-based stocks for 2024.\n\nFor example, according to Research and Markets, “Plant-based foods are gaining popularity due to their advantages for human health and the environment. These products are considered eco-friendly and are associated with lower carbon footprints compared to animal-based diets, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat being said, investors may want to buy these three plant-based stocks for 2024.\n\nOatly (OTLY) OTLY stock: Image of oat milk on a tray.\n\nSource: Katrinshine / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top plant-based stocks for 2024 is Oatly (NASDAQ:OTLY).\n\nAfter plummeting from about $3 to less than 50 cents, Oatly is showing big signs of life again. In fact, after finding support around 50 cents, it popped to about $1.25. From here, I’d like to see it refill its bearish gap around $2 a share initially.\n\nThe largest oat drink company is quickly expanding. Just recently, it announced a new distribution arrangement with The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Brand, a retailer of specialty coffee and tea. It also announced nationwide product availability at Insomnia Cookies.\n\nPlus, earnings haven’t been too shabby. The company posted an EPS loss of seven cents that beat expectations by five cents. Revenue reached $187.6 million which represents a 2.5% year-over-year increase. The company’s adjusted EBITDA loss of $36 million is a $46.7 million improvement compared to the same time last year.\n\nUS Vegan Climate ETF (VEGN) Green vegetables against blue background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at a low cost, there’s always an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the US Vegan Climate ETF (CBOE:VEGN).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.60%, the ETF “tracks the Beyond Investing US Vegan Climate Index. VEGAN screens large-cap US companies for a variety of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) considerations, primarily animal harm and exploitation, as well as fossil fuels, environmental damage, and human rights,” as noted by VeganETF.com.\n\nWhile the ETF is a bit overbought at the moment, consider buying on dips. With strong interest from investors, the ETF ran from a 2023 low of $31 to a high of $43.\n\nSome of its top holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to name a few of the top ones.\n\nIngredion Inc. (INGR) Ingredion Canada Inc head office in Brampton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also Ingredion (NYSE:INGR), a major player in the plant-based food market.\n\nAs noted by Investorplacecontributor Muslim Farooque, “Its pea protein isolate, with a high 85% protein content, is ideal for enhancing various plant-based foods and beverages. Similarly, the company’s pea starch finds versatile applications, including in the production of plant-based cheeses, aligning with evolving consumer trends toward health-conscious eating.”\n\nEarnings haven’t been too shabby here either. In its most recent quarter, the company’s adjusted EPS of $2.33 beat by 38 cents. And while revenue grew 0.5% year over year to $2.03 billion, it still missed by $90 million. At the same time, INGR did raise its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $9.05 to $9.45 from a prior range of $8.80 to $9.40.\n\nThe bullish thesis gained momentum as INGR just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share. The dividend is payable on Jan. 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan. 2. If you missed out on this one, more should be on the way.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "What to do with $100,000? Where to invest that kind of money? These stocks to buy for 2024 include technology stocks, which continue to be a safe bet for growth-oriented investors. Of course, tech stocks are coming off their best year since the heady days of the internet bubble in 1999, with the Nasdaq index rising 43% in 2023. Despite the big rally, there’s still reason to be bullish on tech, semiconductor and microchip stocks in particular.\n\nThese securities have a multi-year growth driver behind them in artificial intelligence (AI). While AI drove the Nasdaq higher last year, the technology is still in its infancy, and companies are only now starting to monetize it. Expect demand for AI microchips and semiconductors to continue growing as the technology changes the world. Here are three stocks to buy for the $100,000 portfolio: 2024 edition.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts at Stifel Financial (NYSE:SF) just upgraded their price target on shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) from $145 to $170. The new price target implies a 20% upside for AMD stock from current levels after a 123% gain over the past 12 months. In December alone, AMD’s share price rose 20%. Stifel analysts cite AMD’s strong balance sheet and ties to secular trends such as AI as reasons to remain bullish on the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD stock has been a long-term winner for investors, gaining 650% over the past five years. The increase in 2023 was only about half the rise with rival chipmaker Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; AMD has outpaced Nvidia over the past six months (24% vs. 12%) and appears to have momentum heading into 2024. AMD’s executives have also clarified that they are going all-in on AI, recently launching a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040,” specifically for AI applications.\n\nCadence Design Systems (CDNS) A Cadence corporate office building has a sign with the company logo out front\n\nSource: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nNow for a technology stock that most investors are likely unfamiliar with—Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS). Based in Silicon Valley and an ongoing concern since 1988, Cadence produces the software, hardware, and silicon pieces for designing and building integrated circuits, microchips and circuit boards. Think of them as creating the nuts and bolts of the microchip industry. While Cadence Design gets little attention, its stock is up 66% over the past 12 months and 510% over five years.\n\nHeading into 2024, Cadence Design Systems could be a good way to play the rally in chip and semiconductor stocks. The company’s earnings remain strong, and it has forecasted full-year 2023 revenue growth of 15% year-over-year and earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20%. Cadence is also flush with cash of $962 million and long-term debt of $649 million at the end of Q3 2023. CDNS stock isn’t cheap, trading at 75 times future earnings estimates, but the stock’s performance justifies the premium price.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a table\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nSticking with chipmakers, we have Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Its stock is up 12% in the past month after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Over the last 12 months, MU stock has risen 66%, up 155% through five years. Not yet profitable, Micron reported a loss of $0.95 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which was better than the expected loss of $1.01 on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $4.73 billion, which beat analysts’ forecasts of $4.58 billion.\n\nMicron is a leader in dynamic random-access memory chips for desktop computers and servers, and flash memory in smartphones and hard drives. During its earnings call, the company’s management team gave a bullish outlook for AI, saying the technology should drive “multiyear growth.” Micron also said that inventory levels for its memory and storage chips are normal, and it’s working with Nvidia on upcoming AI chips—all music to investors’ ears.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and CDNS.

        "title": "7 Dividend-Paying Stocks To Add To Your Income Portfolio In 2024",
        "content": "I believe that 2024 will be good for equities. Potential rate cuts are a big impending catalyst. However, even with a bullish outlook, I would further strengthen my income portfolio by considering exposure to quality dividend-paying stocks. Of course, there are attractive growth stock stories, but it’s important to limit exposure to growth and penny stocks to 40% to 50% of your total portfolio.\n\nAmong dividend-paying stocks, the good news is that there are several that trade at a valuation gap. It’s always a great deal to buy blue-chip stocks at undervalued levels. I therefore believe that the stocks discussed in the column are poised for high total returns in the next few years. Also, if the markets correct, the downside in these stocks is capped and dividend income seems secure considering the cash flow potential.\n\nLet’s discuss the reasons to be positive on these dividend-paying stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is among the quality dividend-paying stocks to buy for an income portfolio. LMT stock offers a dividend yield of 2.78% and trades at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 16.7. Considering the valuations, I am bullish on high total returns.\n\nIt goes without saying that the defense sector is evergreen and Lockheed is positioned to benefit. The company’s backlog has been swelling and stands at $156 billion as of Q3 2023. This provides clear cash flow visibility and with a healthy order intake, dividends are sustainable.\n\nI like the fact that Lockheed is investing significantly in research and development. The focus areas include unmanned aerial missions, next-generation space technology and hypersonic solutions, among others. The key point is that innovation will translate into sustained growth and cash flow upside. Further, focus on international collaborations will help in expanding the addressable market. With LMT stock being sideways in the last 12 months, it’s a good time to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nChevron Corporation (CVX) chevron stock\n\nSource: LesPalenik / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an undervalued oil & gas stock that offers a dividend yield of 4%. With multiple rate cuts likely this year, I am bullish on oil and CVX stock is likely to trend higher from oversold levels. I would add that the stock is worth holding in the core portfolio considering the assets and cash flow potential.\n\nAs of 2022, Chevron reported proved reserves of 11 billion barrels oil-equivalent with a reserve replacement ratio of 97%. The recent acquisition of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) will further add to the reserve base and production visibility.\n\nAt the same time, Chevron has low break-even assets. Even with relatively depressed oil price, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $9.7 billion for Q3 2023. With an investment grade balance sheet, the company has high financial flexibility and has guided for investment of $16 billion in 2024. However, once the acquisition of Hess is completed, annual investment will be ramped-up to $19 to $22 billion.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN) Exterior of the AstraZeneca's manufacturing facility at Snackviken\n\nSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is an undervalued dividend-paying stock that’s worth adding to the portfolio. In the last 12 months, AZN stock has remained sideways and looks attractive at a forward P/E ratio of 18.6. I would bet on high total returns from the stock in the next 24 to 36 months.\n\nThe first point to note is that AstraZeneca has an attractive pipeline. Currently, there are 167 projects in the pipeline with 14 new molecular entities in the late-stage. Potential blockbuster drugs provide growth visibility.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2023, AstraZeneca reported revenue and earnings per share growth of 5% and 17% respectively. It’s likely that earnings growth will remain robust considering the pipeline.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that for year-to-date 2023, the company reported 27% revenue from emerging markets. The company has healthy geographic diversification and emerging markets will continue to boost growth. At the same time, the company is entering into new therapy areas, which will boost the total addressable market.\n\nVale (VALE) Vale Stock Looks Strong Going Into 2020 After January's Brazil Dam Burst\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf we look at a 12-month chart, Vale (NYSE:VALE) stock has remained flat. However, the stock has trended higher by 16% in the last six months. The reason is hopes of expansionary monetary policies this year, which will be positive for industrial commodities.\n\nAs an overview, Vale is a producer and seller of iron ore and iron pellets. This segment is the cash cow for the company. However, Vale is increasingly investing in metals that are likely to see increased demand on the back of global energy transition. This includes copper and nickel. This is one reason to be bullish on VALE stock for the long term.\n\nComing to the financials, Vale reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 billion for Q3 2023. This would imply an annualized EBITDA of $18 billion. However, with iron ore trending higher, I believe that EBITDA is likely to be more than $20 billion for the year. With high financial flexibility, Vale will be positioned to make aggressive investments and increase dividends.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) An image of multiple gold bars. Gold prices\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is an attractive dividend stock to buy with the possibility of robust dividend growth this year. Currently, GOLD stock offers a dividend yield of 2.24% and trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 21.6.\n\nHowever, with gold trending higher, Barrick is positioned to report strong upside in free cash flows. This is likely to translate into aggressive investment and healthy dividend growth. To put things into perspective, Barrick Gold reported operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the first nine months of 2023. This would imply an annual OCF potential of $3.6 billion.\n\nHowever, with higher realized gold price, EBITDA margin expansion would translate into OCF in the range of $4.2 to $4.5 billion. With a strong reserves profile, Barrick will therefore be positioned to make aggressive investments to boost production and benefit from higher realized price. I therefore expect dividend growth to sustain beyond 2024.\n\nScorpio Tankers (STNG) Aerial front side view of oil tanker ship sailing on open sea, Imperial Petroleum (IMPP) operates oil tankers\n\nSource: Igor Karasi / Shutterstock.com\n\nScorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG) stock has trended higher by 19% in the last 12 months. However, STNG stock remains deeply undervalued at a forward P/E ratio of 6. Further, a dividend yield of 2.24% is attractive and I expect the stock to deliver robust total returns.\n\nAs an overview, Scorpio is the world’s largest product tanker owner. The company has a fleet of 112 wholly owned, lease financed or bareboat chartered-in tankers. With attractive time charter equivalent rates, Scorpio is attractive and positioned to deliver steady revenue and healthy cash flows.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2023, Scorpio reported time charter equivalent revenue of $994 million. For the same period, the company’s adjusted EBITDA was $722 million. Clearly, EBITDA margin is robust and this has translated into dividend growth coupled with a strong balance sheet. As of November 2023, the company had a liquidity buffer of $810 million. This provides financial flexibility for potential fleet expansion.\n\nAmdocs (DOX) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmong undervalued dividend-paying stocks, Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) is worth considering. DOX stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 13.5 and offers a dividend yield of 1.98%. I am bullish on the stock trending higher and I also believe that dividend growth will be robust.\n\nAs an overview, Amdocs is a provider of software solutions and services to the media and telecommunication industry. The company has strong global presence, which is likely to translate into sustained revenue growth.\n\nI would like to focus on the point that Amdocs reported free cash flow of $698 million for financial year 2023. For the current financial year, the company has guided for FCF of $750 million. This is the biggest positive as robust FCF will translate into healthy dividend growth. Further, Amdocs is positioned for opportunistic acquisitions that’s backed by high financial flexibility.\n\nI must add here that Amdocs has partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to accelerate adoption of generative AI for the $1.7 trillion telecom industry. With a big addressable market, the growth and FCF outlook is positive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we present 15 best growth stocks under $25. If you want to skip our discussion on the performance of growth stocks, head directly to 5 Best Growth Stocks Under $25.\n\nThe markets have rallied for the better part of the year at the back of the US Federal Reserve, hiking interest rates to 22-year highs. The push of the benchmark rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% has helped push inflation to lows of 3.1%. On the other hand, the hikes threaten to plunge the economy into recession amid slowing economic activities.\n\nNevertheless, investors have shunned the recession concerns, betting that the bull run will continue into 2024. The S&P 500 has rallied 26.3% for the year including dividend payments, with the Nasdaq 100 following suit with a nearly 54% gain.\n\nHeading into 2024, there is a clear indication that the upward momentum will continue gathering pace amid a string of positive factors. Key among them is growing expectations that the Fed will start cutting interest rates as early as the first half of the year. While stocks rallied even as the central bank hiked in 2022, expectations are high that cuts would be a major catalyst that should fuel the upward momentum.\n\nIn addition, solid revenue growth rates and corporate earnings are other factors increasingly fueling investor’s interest rates in the market. High-growth stocks led by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) have delivered impressive revenue and earnings growth supported by a resilient economy and solid consumer spending power.\n\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has also helped strengthen investor interest in some equities. Semiconductor heavyweights led by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have been some of the biggest beneficiaries amid growing demand for their chips to power the AI push. Likewise, companies like Salesforce and Palantir integrating AI tools into their solutions have also exploded as investors take note of the massive opportunities up for grabs.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the stock market appears to lose its momentum during the first 2 trading days of 2024 as some analysts are already sounding warnings about valuations that appear to have gotten out of hand amid the blockbuster gains. The S&P 500 is priced above 30 times profits, one of the highest readings on record. There are already concerns that the overbought S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite could face major headwinds as investors start to book profits.\n\nThe Bank of England has already issued warnings reiterating that US tech stocks and dollar-denominated corporate bands appear overstretched on the valuation front. \"The overall risk environment continues to be challenging and near-term growth prospects remain subdued. Given the impact of higher interest rates, and uncertainties associated with inflation and growth, some risky asset valuations appear to be stretched,\" the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said after a quarterly meeting. 15 Best Growth Stocks Under $25\n\nA trader in an office, surrounded by financial charts and graphs, looking intently at a stock ticker.\n\nThe comments by the Bank of England come when many popular growth stocks are trading at a sharp premium to the S&P 500. The premium valuations come against the backdrop of rates sitting near record highs and fueling concerns of a potential slowdown next year. In addition, soaring geopolitical tensions also raise serious doubt about the market outlook heading into 2024.\n\nNevertheless, the best growth stocks to buy under $25 could be the answer for shrugging off the premium valuation concerns and riding the bull run into 2024. The fastest-growing quality stocks trading under $25 offer one of the best ways of diversifying an investment portfolio while eying high returns down the road.\n\nThe Fed hinting at possible rate cuts next year should be one of the catalysts likely to support the best growth stocks to buy under $25. Falling interest rates are expected to benefit such companies, given the expected reduction in borrowing costs that most companies need to support their research and development efforts. Some of the notable names likely to do well on a cut in interest rates from 22-year highs include Flywire Corp (NASDAQ:FLYW), Coursera Inc. (NYSE:COUR), and TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nOur list of the best stocks to buy under $25 includes stocks in several sectors that are expected to double their revenue over the next few years, therefore generating more shareholder value.

(NASDAQ:ROVR) is a communication services company operating an online pet care marketplace worldwide. Rover Group, Inc.

Rover, a pet care marketplace, is a prime example of a business that’s poised for success in virtually any economic environment. It reported a set of fantastic earnings due to which its stock gained 50% and has not given up much of that gain in the recent pullback. This is a position that has been in the portfolio since September 2022 but we added to the position as we gained conviction in the thesis.\n\nOperating as a marketplace, Rover earns a “take rate” or a kind of “toll” on every transaction occurring within its platform. In the face of inflation, as pet sitters request higher prices for their services, Rover’s revenues naturally grow because its share of the transaction value increases. In addition, Rover is a category disrupter due to which its revenue growth is likely to be much higher than the average stock – it is taking share from friends and family as well as kennels. Finally, networks like Rover get more valuable over time due to which they have to spend less to attract more users on their platform. This results in operating leverage due to which its earnings are poised to grow even faster than revenues.… ” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10. Coursera, Inc.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) was the S&P 500's top performer in 2023 with shares rallying 239%, and analysts at Stifel think the chipmaker still has room to run.\n\nAnalyst Ruben Roy named Nvidia a 'best idea' for 2024, telling Yahoo Finance Live the chipmaker is 'well positioned' given the shift from general purpose compute to accelerated compute.\n\n\"There are different layers of Nvidia's AI strategy,\" Roy said. \"There’s chips and hardware, but there's also networking behind it, and probably the most important piece that investors will start thinking about this year is software.”\n\nRoy noted the move to accelerated compute represents Nvidia's \"most significant revenue and profitability growth opportunity\" over the next several years.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nSEANA SMITH: Analysts are still feeling bullish on NVIDIA after the stock climbed over 200% last year. Stifel, one of those names, and doesn't expect the AI momentum to slow down anytime soon, calling the chip stock a quote, \"best idea\" for 2024.\n\nWe want to bring in the analyst behind that call, Reuben Roy, he's a Stifel Applied Technology analyst there. Reuben, it's great to have you here. So I think a lot of people are asking what exactly the gains could look like here for NVIDIA, at least over the next 12 months, given that massive rally that we saw last year. So what's the catalyst here for that upside to continue?\n\nREUBEN ROY: Yeah, it's a great question. And thanks for having me. So we put out our trends report-- the tech team at Stifel yesterday. And top 10 trends-- we do this every year. And really, it was about AI, not surprisingly. But it was more about the broadening of AI.\n\nLast year, it was a lot about NVIDIA and GPU clusters, and this massive dollars being spent by the cloud service providers on building out training networks. But when you look past that-- AI servers, AI PCs-- there's a lot of AI innovation and applications coming behind, right? And when we looked at all the companies that could potentially benefit, guess what. NVIDIA ticks all the boxes, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nSo NVIDIA is still playing in the clusters, we think. There's still going to be an investment cycle continuing for AI training clusters. But when you look beyond that, we do think that if you think about AI servers that are going to be doing the next step of AI-- so we're training last year, training this year, then inference. Where are we going to make the money? Where are the ROIs going to come from?\n\nAnd NVIDIA ticks those boxes. So we think it's going to be a good year. Numbers went up massively last year. But there are different layers of NVIDIA's AI strategy. You've got the chips, the hardware, which is the biggest piece, but then there's networking behind it that networks all of these clusters together. And probably, the most important piece that I think investors really will start thinking about this year is software.\n\nAnd NVIDIA came up with a software stack, CUDA, that is the ecosystem of AI right now. And if you look at Apple and iOS, the way we're thinking about it is if you can win the developer, you're going to win the hardware. And so I think that's what the next stage of the NVIDIA story for this year is going to be.",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +3.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +409.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.9%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $12.29 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +268%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.91 indicates a change of +62% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $20.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +232.2%. The $58.92 billion and $90.57 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +118.4% and +53.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +205.5%. EPS of $4.02 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.9%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 7 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have delivered incredible returns and crushed the market over the last year -- and the trend looks poised to continue in 2024.\n\nWhile some smaller companies will undoubtedly emerge as winners, the competitive advantages granted by infrastructure and data strengths suggest the AI race will continue to favor large players.\n\nWith that in mind, investors can best position themselves to profit from the AI revolution by building positions in today's category leaders. Read on to see why investing in these resource-rich, industry-leading companies is a great way to play AI trends in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies are at the heart of the AI revolution. When it comes to the advanced GPUs used to power AI applications, data centers, and other forms of accelerated computing, the semiconductor leader controls roughly 90% of the market. The company has entered an incredible new AI-powered growth phase, and soaring demand made it the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock over the last year.\n\nIn addition to a rock-solid demand outlook for its GPUs, Nvidia is building out its software business and offering AI computing as a service. With its hardware playing a foundational role in pushing AI forward and new business initiatives looking poised to deliver additional sales growth and very strong margins, profits are on track to continue expanding rapidly.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nAI is already powering strong performance for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). This trend is most visible in the company's Azure cloud computing business, with demand for cloud infrastructure services surging as developers launch and scale AI applications. But AI stands to benefit virtually every business under Microsoft's corporate umbrella.\n\nAI is on track to power continued advances for the company's operating systems, productivity software, search business, video games unit, and other businesses. Due to the popularity of its far-reaching product and service offerings, Microsoft also has access to tons of valuable data -- data that can be used to build and improve AI systems. Thanks to the strength of its product and services ecosystem and incredible technology resources, Microsoft stands at the top of the AI software power rankings.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Palantir\n\nFounded in 2003, Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) has had a focus on machine learning and AI technologies for over two decades. Thanks to its ability to gather and analyze valuable data to produce simulations and suggest optimal courses of action, the software specialist has won major contracts with agencies within the U.S. Department of Defense and other government organizations.\n\nThe data analytics specialist has also been rapidly attracting business customers -- and its new AI technologies look poised to power accelerating growth in the private sector. Palantir launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in May 2023. By August, over 100 organizations were using the service. And by November, AIP had a customer base spanning nearly 300 distinct organizations.\n\nWhile Palantir stock has been red hot, rising roughly 160% over the last year, it's still down 57% from its high. For long-term investors, this AI growth stock has the potential to be a massive winner.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nWhile most of Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) revenue comes from its e-commerce business, the large majority of its profits come from Amazon Web Services (AWS). With demand for cloud infrastructure and other tools used to power AI applications poised to surge, Amazon could see sales growth for its most profitable business segment start to reaccelerate.\n\nBut AI will likely also power incredible improvements for the company's e-commerce business. With AI tech paving the way for increased factory automation and autonomous deliveries, margins for the online retail business could see dramatic improvements. If that happens, profits from Amazon's massive e-commerce could soar and power incredible gains for the stock.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike other top tech players, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has big advantages in AI thanks to the breadth of its software offerings and access to massive troves of valuable data. Trading at roughly 21 times expected earnings for 2024, its stock also looks like one of the best value buys in the AI space. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nBetween its market-leading search and mobile operating system (OS) technologies, fast-growing cloud infrastructure business, communication and productivity software, and YouTube streaming platform, Alphabet has many avenues to win in AI. Through its Waymo subsidiary, Alphabet is also a leader in autonomous vehicle technologies and stands to see explosive benefits as AI-powered self-driving tech evolves.\n\nWith multiple ways to profit with AI and its stock trading at non-prohibitive levels, Alphabet is a great pick for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\n\n6. CrowdStrike\n\nThe use of AI technologies to create and deploy cyberattacks could be one of this century's most disruptive trends. Thankfully, top cybersecurity companies are using advanced AI technologies to combat the rising tide of threats.\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is arguably the leader when it comes to AI-powered cybersecurity software, and it's indisputably the leader in its corner of the market. The adaptive technologies offered through its Falcon platform help businesses and institutions prevent breaches of their networks through linked computers, mobile devices, servers, and other hardware.\n\nThe cybersecurity arms race could be one of the most important and most broadly overlooked aspects of the AI revolution. For investors looking to profit from the intersection of these world-shaping trends, CrowdStrike stands out as a top play.\n\n7. Meta Platforms\n\nAI-enhanced content feeds, ad targeting, and cost-saving efficiency initiatives are powering a major resurgence for Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). In the third quarter, the company's revenue rose 23% year over year to reach more than $34.1 billion. Earnings per share jumped 168% in the period, and the social networking leader ended the period with a staggering 3.05 billion users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other platforms.\n\nMeta should be able to score additional AI-driven wins with its content feeds and ad platforms, and it's still in the early stages of monetizing chatbots and using AI to advance its metaverse vision. With its massive global user base, data access, and deep technology resources, the company is in a good position to keep racking up long-term wins.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nasdaq's Rally to Continue in 2024: 5 Must-Buy Growth Techs",
        "content": "The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite has been one of the top-performing indices in 2023, with more than 43% return, posting its best yearly performance since 2020.\r\n\r\nRobust performances from the “Magnificent Seven” — a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett — comprising Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA NVDA and Tesla, helped the index to soar last year.\r\n\r\nNasdaq’s momentum is expected to continue in 2024 with the growing expectations of a broader rally thanks to resilient economic growth, cooling inflation, growing expectations of rapid rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the upswing in consumer confidence and increasing chances of a soft landing.\r\n\r\nThe December Job report set to be released this Friday will play a crucial role in determining how aggressively the Federal Reserve will cut rates in the near term. Federal Reserve expects core inflation to decline to 3.2% in 2023, 2.4% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. Inflation is expected to hit the Federal Reserve’s 2% target in 2026.\r\n\r\nThe increasing chances of a soft landing — a scenario in which inflation cools off to the Fed’s target without a recession — is expected to benefit technology stocks.\r\n\r\nTechnology stocks are well-poised to benefit from the growing proliferation of AI and machine learning. Spending on AI systems is expected to accelerate in 2024 as organizations continue to leverage AI as part of their digital transformation efforts. The advent of generative AI has further attracted investments.\r\n\r\nImproving semiconductor sales bodes well for technology stocks. The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization expects semiconductor sales to grow 13.1% in 2024, following an estimated 9.4% decline in 2023.\n\nOur Picks\n\nHere, we have picked five technology stocks that are set to outperform the Nasdaq this year.\r\n\r\nThese stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nPer the Zacks proprietary methodology, stocks with this favorable combination offer good investment opportunities.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBlackbaud BLKB is benefiting from robust organic growth and extensive cost-cutting measures. Momentum in both contractual and transactional recurring revenue streams, coupled with rising volumes across its other payment solutions, bode well.\r\n\r\nBlackbaud is expected to benefit from its new contractual pricing approach. It is also working toward rolling out AI-enabled capabilities across its portfolio to help clients optimize fundraising.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has improved 1.6% over the past 60 days to $4.53 per share. BLKB shares have returned 42.7% in the past year.\r\n\r\nJFrog FROG is riding on strong demand for its cloud services, broader adoption of security solutions and growing enterprise-scale adoption of its software supply chain platform.\r\n\r\nExpanding clientele has been a tailwind. In third-quarter 2023, customers with annual recurring revenue of more than $100K grew to 848, up 22% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for JFrog’s 2024 earnings has increased 6% to 53 cents per share over the past 60 days. FROG shares have surged 52% in the trailing 12-months.\r\n\r\nGitlab GTLB is benefiting from a robust product portfolio that integrates AI-powered DevSecOps features into a single application to boost productivity. It enables businesses to create more reliable and functionality-packed mission-critical software. GTLB’s platform improves engineering productivity and reduces software spend.\r\n\r\nGitlab’s shares have returned 36.7% in the trailing 12-months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2025 earnings has improved 126.7% over the past 60 days to 34 cents per share.\r\n\r\nMongoDB MDB shares have returned 101.1% in the past year. It is benefiting from strong momentum in Atlas.\r\n\r\nMDB is witnessing continuous growth in the MongoDB Atlas customer base. Its deepening focus on acquiring new customers, cross-selling to existing customers and retaining them with the introduction of new Atlas features is expected to drive its top-line growth in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Atlas for Industries, Atlas for Financial Services, Atlas for the Public Sector, and Atlas for Manufacturing and Automotive remains a major upside.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has increased 14.3% to $3.20 per share over the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is benefiting from growing investments in generative AI. The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is dominating the market for AI chips. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVIDIA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have surged 234.5% in the trailing 12-months. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has jumped 21.8% over the past 60 days to $19.91 per share.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nasdaq 100 Alert: 7 Undervalued Tech Stocks Ready to Rocket in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 had a banner year. After a disastrous 2022 that saw the tech-laden index lose one-third of its value, it rebounded sharply in 2023 soaring 55% to hit a new all-time high. Of course, most of those gains were because of the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\nSince the index is market cap-weighted the relative size of the companies skewed the results. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone accounts for 9% of the Nasdaq 100 while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents another 8.6%. Together, the seven companies total over 38% of the index. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) called their performance the “defining feature of the equity market in 2023.”\n\nThat means last year’s Nasdaq 100 performance wasn’t very broad-based. It will be difficult for that select group of stocks to repeat their gains this year. Instead, quite a few undervalued tech stocks in the index will soar in 2024. Here are the top seven to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) used to be known as the “backbone of the internet” because of the role its routers and networking equipment played in keeping business online. Today the commoditization of hardware is a challenge. So are the rise of cloud computing and changing IT buying patterns. To address these issues, Cisco is evolving its software, cloud, and security strategy. It aims to transition the majority of its portfolio to everything-as-a-service over time. It calls the move Cisco+.\n\nThe software-focused approach could create large gains for the company in the long run, as it makes its revenue less cyclical, more recurring, and more profitable. It just delivered its strongest fiscal first quarter in company history. Revenue jumped 8% to $14.7 billion while profits raced 36% higher to $3.6 billion.\n\nCisco still needs to demonstrate its value proposition to its customers. By executing on its software, cloud, and security strategy, it can achieve its growth targets and retain its market leadership. With the stock trading at 12 times earnings estimates and 11x free cash flow (FCF), it’s presenting excellent value with tremendous upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nGilead Sciences (GILD) A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiopharmaceutical Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) develops and commercializes antiviral therapies for treating HIV, hepatitis, and cancer. Biktarvy for HIV is its lead drug, generating $3.1 billion in sales globally in the third quarter and $8.7 billion year-to-date. That’s up 17% from last year. A second treatment, Descovey, has $1.3 billion in sales over the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nThese drugs are offsetting the decline of older therapies like Veklury, which was the first FDA-approved antiviral for Covid-19. Although Gilead generated significant revenue from it in 2020 and 2021, sales are rapidly fading.\n\nThere is a dual-edged sword to the potential of its cell therapies Yescarta and Tecartus. On the one hand sales of the treatments are up 35% this year, but on the other the FDA is investigating potential issues with such chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapies. Cancer patients treated with CAR T-cell drugs reportedly developed lymphomas or other malignancies. Gilead operates a new automated CAR T-cell facility that just got FDA approval in April 2022. Fortunately, the therapies aren’t critical to Gilead’s current performance so far, but they are a future growth channel that could be at risk.\n\nThe biotech does have a healthy pipeline of treatments in clinical trials. So long as it can successfully launch and grow its new products, especially in the oncology and inflammatory segments, and leverage its existing portfolio and pipeline to diversify and strengthen its revenue streams, it got potential to rocket higher this year.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) doesn’t make chips itself but makes ion implantation systems that are critical to the chip-making process. It’s part of a duopoly with Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) offering a full range of implant products. Their international competitors don’t have the same breadth of products and services.\n\nThe booming semiconductor industry means there is more than enough business to go around. Axcelis sales jumped 25% so far this year with profits racing 39% higher. While the stock soared 63% in 2023 there’s good reason to believe it can continue climbing.\n\nDue to the heightened demand for electric vehicles (EV), renewable energy, and 5G applications, Axcelis can rapidly expand its share in the silicon carbide power market. It’s the only company with a product line that can deliver complete recipe coverage for all power device applications.\n\nIt also has a diversified customer base, including those for so-called trailing-edge processes. These are older and less advanced technologies still widely used for automotive, industrial, and Internet of Things applications but still have robust demand. Axcelis’ Purion line can support a wide range of implant applications, from 300mm to 200mm and smaller wafers.\n\nDespite its stock gains Axcelis still trades at 15 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its long-term earnings growth rate. There’s no reason it can’t rocket even higher next year.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity specialist Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is benefiting from the inexorable transition of data to the cloud. It provides cybersecurity solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government organizations. The number of security breaches hit record levels before the year even ended. Although the cybersecurity arena is becoming more competitive, Fortinet has several levers it can pull to dramatically increase growth.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI)-based cybersecurity market is expected to grow rapidly because of the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks. Fortinet invested heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities to enhance its threat detection, prevention, and response solutions. There had been a concern enterprise customers would cut back on cybersecurity spending if a recession loomed, but the damage to operations and reputation might prevent that from happening on too broad of a scale.\n\nFortinet can also leverage its Security Fabric platform, which integrates and automates security from network to cloud to endpoint. It says the platform enables customers to achieve higher levels of security, performance, and efficiency, while reducing complexity and costs. It’s also establishing itself as the industry leader in firewalls and software-defined wide area networks, or SD-WANs. It’s an emerging computer networking technology that connects data centers to branches and the cloud.\n\nFortinet’s stock isn’t cheap, but it still has the chance to expand its multiples even more in the year ahead.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had an impressive run in 2023 but should still be considered an undervalued tech stock. It is working to regain its technical edge over Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). New products including Emerald Rapids Xeon processors and Meteor Lake mobile processors aim to restore Intel’s superiority or at least gain technical parity. Similarly its new Gaudi3 AI chip puts Intel in the game with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD.\n\nIntel is also leveraging its chip manufacturing capabilities in the foundry business to provide chip fabrication services to other companies. It counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the U.S. Defense Dept. as clients. The fact that it is primarily based in the U.S. gives it a competitive edge in the wake of global geopolitical uncertainty that’s disrupted supply chains worldwide. It also has a new fab facility in Europe to expand its capacity and meet growing chip demand there.\n\nIntel’s data center business faced challenges in recent years due to increased competition, innovation, and market shifts. However, that is expected to recover. Similarly, the expected debut in 2024 of AI PCs could revive the industry. These are just some of the growth levers available to Intel to pull in 2024.\n\nExpedia (EXPE) Expedia app logo on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline travel stock Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) took a long trip higher in 2023. Shares rose 80% with most of the gains beginning in November on travel demand returning to pre-pandemic levels. Expedia beat analyst profit estimates and recorded record revenue in the third quarter.\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association, overall traveler numbers will exceed pre-Covid levels. They are expected to reach 4 billion in 2024. Passenger volume is projected to hit 9.4 billion passengers worldwide this year, surpassing 2019’s 9.2 billion.\n\nExpedia remains one of the leading online travel companies with well-known brands including its namesake Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, and Egencia. Despite last year’s gains the online travel agency trades at a lower valuation than its peers and its own historical averages. The stock goes for just 12 earnings estimates and 11 times free cash flow. Profit margins and cash flow generation, however, are stronger than some rivals like Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Moreover, Expedia can use platforms like Vrbo to further encroach on territory already held by Airbnb.\n\nLook for Expedia to continue rebounding in 2024 as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic and adapts to the new normal.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo paraphrase Mark Twain, the rumor of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) death has been greatly exaggerated. In fact, Netflix actually won the streaming wars. While competing services like Disney‘s (NYSE:DIS) Disney+ and Paramount Global‘s (NASDAQ:PARA) Paramount+ burst on the scene during the pandemic with great fanfare, they haven’t been able to maintain their momentum.\n\nAnalysts believed movie studios getting into streaming would undercut Netflix ability to survive. Pulling content from the platform for their own streaming services would starve Netflix of content. As it turns out, there really hasn’t been enough of a reason to continue subscribing to these rivals while Netflix is still expanding. It ended the third quarter with 247 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nAlthough it was believed Netflix cracking down on password sharing could damage its business, that’s not the case either. It has an opportunity to grow even more by converting an estimated 100 million users into paying customers. Advertising is another huge opportunity, though CFO Spencer Neumann told Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) says Netflix is still “the crawl of the crawl-walk-run stage” of both growth levers.\n\nNetflix has also shown it possesses superb pricing power. It avoided increasing customer churn by responsibly increasing subscription costs. This is a trio of opportunities the streamer can continue to press to its advantage this year. It’s stock is not the cheapest either, but having survived the streaming wars and come out on top again indicates Netflix is an undervalued tech stock that can keep growing in the year ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The advancement of artificial intelligence revitalized tech stocks in 2023. Yet, as 2024 looms, investors are becoming more selective, especially in AI sectors. A prime focus is the metaverse, where AI is crucial for development. This intersection makes metaverse stocks a smart addition to 2024 portfolios.\n\nAccording to Statista, the metaverse market is expected to skyrocket to $507 billion by 2030, signaling a tenfold increase from its current value. Moreover, Accenture’s latest banking sector report further supports the metaverse as being a key driver. Hence, metaverse stocks are likely to reap substantial benefits from this surge.\n\nAdditionally, the economy’s strong performance boosts metaverse stocks. Increased disposable income is channeling more investments into innovative technologies and virtual experiences. The metaverse envisioned as a virtual realm where users interact through digital twins, is set to blend business with leisure, complementing our physical reality. In this environment, three exceptional Metaverse stocks stand poised for significant growth, offering investors a gateway to this rapidly evolving digital transformation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a tech industry titan, continues to excel, driven by its advancements in artificial intelligence. Its commitment to innovation has not only fueled its growth but also expanded its influence across the tech sector. Their cutting-edge technology is crucial for generating the immersive 3D spaces integral to the metaverse, positioning Nvidia as a key player in this emerging field.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia’s strategic collaborations, particularly with Microsoft’s Azure, demonstrate a focused effort to broaden its reach in cloud-based AI solutions. These partnerships aim to create comprehensive, enterprise-grade offerings, further solidifying the company’s position as a leader in tech innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, Nvidia’s third-quarter results are remarkable. The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.02, exceeding expectations by 63 cents, and a revenue surge to $18.12 billion, up 205.6% year-over-year. A record Data Center revenue of $14.51 billion, up 41% from the previous quarter, further demonstrates NVIDIA’s strong market presence and consistent financial performance.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands out as a top metaverse stock, eclipsing its competitors. Thanks to its sizeable investment in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), Meta has firmly established itself as a frontrunner in the metaverse realm. This strategic focus has propelled the stock to an impressive 184% surge year-to-date, highlighting its market dominance and potential.\n\nOne of Meta’s notable innovations is “Imagine,” a text-to-image tool designed for creators on its social media platforms. While currently focused on social media, “Imagine” aligns seamlessly with Meta’s broader metaverse ambitions, hinting at future integration. Furthermore, Oculus headset is pivotal in Meta Platforms’ metaverse ambitions. Acquired in 2014, Oculus bolsters Meta’s VR capabilities, critical in the creation of immersive online experiences. Despite the headwinds, Oculus sales are remarkably impressive, with more than 20 million VR headset sold.\n\nMeta Platforms’ recent financial performance further solidifies its leading position. The company reported GAAP earnings per share of $4.39, exceeding expectations by 76 cents, and a revenue increase of 23.2% year-over-year to $34.15 billion, outperforming predictions by $700 million. With shares up by 4%, Meta’s momentum appears unstoppable, making it an essential stock for investors exploring the metaverse.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuilding the metaverse requires significant financial resources, often beyond the reach of mid-cap companies. However, Unity Software (NYSE:U) breaks this mold. As a mid-cap firm, it’s uniquely positioned to make a significant impact in the metaverse, particularly with its plans to enable virtual try-ons for clothes and accessories through realistic VR models, signaling a new era in online shopping.\n\nUnity Software’s platform is a game-changer, enabling developers to create interactive 2D and 3D environments. Originally focused on gaming, this technology has significant potential for the ongoing development of the metaverse. Despite a recent dip following its quarterly report, which showed a third-quarter earnings loss of 32 cents per share but a positive free cash flow of $104 million, Unity’s trajectory in the metaverse remains promising.\n\nReinforcing its metaverse commitment, Unity’s strategic acquisition of Parsec, a cloud gaming and streaming firm, enhances Unity’s capabilities, positioning it as a burgeoning force in the metaverse arena.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "This article examines the 12 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy for 2024 according to financial media. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Buy for 2024 According to Financial Media.\n\nTech stocks had a great time in 2023, with about 60% gains for the information technology sector and the NASDAQ 100 index due to advancements in artificial intelligence and its speedy incorporation into businesses and daily life. The shares of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have soared by more than three times, whereas the shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have increased by 80% and 60%, respectively. According to the financial media, an AI-related bull run will continue in 2024. This is because businesses from all industries are attempting to use emerging technology to improve their business efficiency or enhance the performance of their products. Forbes predicts that between 2023 and 2030, the global AI market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3%. Morgan Stanley researchers believe that digital products' seamless adoption of AI would shift consumers' gravitation towards online experiences rather than offline ones.\n\nMain Street Research chief investment officer James Demmert, a 30-year investing veteran, predicts a massive rally in AI stocks in 2024 that he believes will last for the next decade. He anticipates the upward trend will continue due to the increased productivity brought about by AI. He stated the following about the AI-related bull run:\n\n\"The market's recent strength is indicative of a new and very real AI-led bull market and business cycle that could last a decade thanks to the productivity growth and tailwinds from AI. Experienced investors know that this kind of broad based strength across all sectors and capitalizations is reminiscent of the first year of previous bull markets that has much further to run, with inevitable corrections along the way. We urge investors not to allow the market's recent strength to scare you out of stocks or prevent you from participating. Adding stocks during any kind of market pullback is the correct strategy at this early stage of the bull market. The fundamentals here are very appealing and likely long-lasting for years not months.”\n\nStory continues\n\nUBS characterized generative artificial intelligence as a potentially disruptive and revolutionary technology in a note. UBS added that the introduction of new technologies has contributed significantly to a wide range of industries in history and that generative AI has the potential to boost the entire economy.\n\n“Stocks have already rallied hard in anticipation of higher AI demand, yet we think companies across the AI value chain from cloud to semis, software, and internet, will further run, both in 2024 and over the longer term. We believe that investors looking for exposure to AI should seek broad exposure across the value chain.”\n\nThe best artificial intelligence stocks to buy for 2024 according to financial media belong to software, cloud computing service providers, and technology behemoths. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), C3.ai, Inc. (NASDAQ:AI), Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Be greedy when others are fearful.\" It means that you should buy stocks based on logic, not emotions. But following its direction is not as easy as it seems. Watching the daily ups and downs of the stock market, it's clear that a lot of investors are highly irrational. The problem is, investing based on impulses usually backfires.\n\nLetting emotions impact investing decisions is a common mistake. What's the solution? One option is to consider dollar-cost averaging, or buying a little of a stock at a time. Investing based on a system can help prevent these emotional urges.\n\nOf course, even with dollar-cost averaging, you want to accumulate the right stocks. Here are three stocks that are so good you can slowly pick up shares regardless of what the market is doing and expect a decent return over the long term.\n\n1. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\n\nLots of investors measure themselves against the broader market. But instead of trying to beat it, why not just match it? The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) is an exchange-traded fund built to mimic the S&P 500, an index of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. The S&P 500 has historically returned an average of 9% to 10% annually.\n\nThere is no shame in simply buying the broader stock market. Warren Buffett famously won a million-dollar bet with a hedge fund manager that an S&P 500 index fund would beat a basket of actively managed mutual funds over 10 years. In other words, consistently outperforming the broader stock market is hard.\n\nSince nobody can predict where the stock market will go, it's a perfect stock to add a few shares occasionally and hold. While the market will have ups and downs, it's always gone up over the long term, and it's near all-time highs right now! This a simple way to add a sure winner to your investing strategy.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nFor individual stocks, computer chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) tops a short list of stocks investors could indiscriminately buy and hold. That's because it's a runaway leader in one of this generation's most important technology breakthroughs, artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia specializes in chips for highly demanding computing applications, which, for years, was high-end gaming.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the emergence of generative AI caused a rush for corporations to invest in building powerful computers to run AI models (which requires crunching massive amounts of data), and it has turned out perfectly for Nvidia. The company quickly became the go-to chip supplier, grabbing an estimated market share of over 80%. Considering research from McKinsey forecasts generative AI will be worth as much as $4.4 trillion in annual economic output, that's an extraordinary opportunity that Nvidia can tap into.\n\nThe stock ran wild in 2023, so the share price might eventually give some of that back. Additionally, Nvidia should be part of a well-diversified portfolio. But its long-term growth prospects -- analysts believe Nvidia's earnings can grow by 42% annually -- make the stock an investment you can schedule regular purchases for and hold for years.\n\n3. Tesla\n\nTech giant Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) might be one of the few obvious winners rivaling Nvidia's long-term growth opportunities. Tesla is a pioneer and leader in the design and manufacture of electric vehicles. However, it has multiple irons in the fire. It's developing self-driving technology, solar energy collection and storage, and AI-powered humanoid robots. Consider the size of these applications. There are billions of homes and buildings worldwide to power, and billions of people doing manual labor. Today, over 1 billion vehicles are on the world's roads, and just a low single-digit percentage are electric. Tesla only needs pieces of these virtual oceans of potential opportunity to create exceptional business (and investment) outcomes.\n\nIt can sometimes sound outlandish, but Tesla has been proving pessimists wrong for years. The stock has returned over 15,000% over its lifetime, which goes back to its initial public offering (IPO) in 2010. CEO Elon Musk took over the company just 25 years ago, a very short time considering the returns it has created. Annual revenue is approaching $100 billion, which could be just the beginning if you consider all the flexibility Tesla's business has over the next 25 years and beyond.\n\nTesla stock has proven volatile at times. Additionally, shares appear expensive after big gains last year. With that said, those looking decades into the future shouldn't be shy about slowly building an investment as part of their diversified portfolio to benefit from owning a piece of this proven innovator.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Growth stocks get the designation because they have the potential to generate life-changing gains for investors. Some even do so in a relatively short time frame. Finding proper growth stocks generally involves determining which companies can turn the above-average growth they might be seeing short-term into long-term earnings and stock price appreciation. If those companies will generate massive returns in a relatively short period, that's much less predictable.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ: AXSM) are some recent examples of companies that managed to generate outsized growth in a short timeframe, surprising the markets. All three stocks were 10-baggers over the past five years. Here's a look at what was behind their strong performances and some informed analysis on whether they're still good buys today.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt would have been difficult to predict Nvidia's trajectory five years ago. The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) this past year wasn't on anyone's radar. But it ended up being a big reason Nvidia was a hot stock to own over the past five years -- demand for AI chips has been through the roof.\n\nA $50,000 investment in Nvidia five years ago would be worth more than $730,000 today. A significant chunk of those gains came in 2023 (it was up 230%), thanks to AI and the emergence of ChatGPT. Those outsized gains pushed its valuation above $1.2 trillion.\n\nNvidia stock sells at a premium now, trading at more than 60 times earnings, but it can still be a good buy. The company has a 70% market share of the overall AI chip market, which is expected to grow more than 40% (compounded) annually through 2030. And with plenty of demand still to come in generative AI, this is one of the best AI stocks to buy for the long haul.\n\nIn the company's most recent quarterly results (for the period ended on Oct. 29), Nvidia's revenue rose by 206% to $18.1 billion -- a record for the business. With growth like that and more opportunities still out there for Nvidia, it's easy to see why this can still make for an excellent investment right now.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Tesla\n\nOver the past five years, Tesla transformed itself from an unprofitable company into one of the leading stocks on the S&P 500. These days discussion has turned to whether Tesla can maintain its blistering growth rate and if its margins are high enough.\n\nA $50,000 investment in Tesla five years ago would be worth close to $560,000. And that's with some significant price volatility over that time as well as the stock giving back some gains recently.\n\nTesla is still a promising investment as the world transitions toward electric vehicles, but it is likely to remain a bumpy ride for investors going forward. The company's margins took a hit recently, as Tesla cut prices on its vehicles to remain competitive. The recent launch of its Cybertruck, which is unlikely to be profitable in 2024, will only exacerbate short-term concerns relating to its bottom line.\n\nAt 80 times earnings, the stock isn't cheap. While the business may be a safer one to invest in versus where Tesla was five years ago, investors should temper their expectations for the future. For those who are willing to hang on for several years, this can still be a good stock to own but don't expect a smooth ride.\n\n3. Axsome Therapeutics\n\nTesla and Nvidia have been great buys over the past five years, but Axsome Therapeutics performed even better. A $50,000 investment in the biotech stock five years ago would have made you a millionaire today, with the value of that investment now being worth $1.8 million.\n\nThat's easier said than done, of course, as five years ago the company had no approved products, and was an extremely risky buy. But oversized gains (and losses) are not unusual in the biotech world, where hype or approval from the Food and Drug Administration can send a company's shares skyrocketing in no time.\n\nAxsome obtained approval for Auvelity, its treatment for major depressive disorder, in 2022, and the stock has been climbing since then. The blockbuster drug could generate $1.8 billion in annual sales for Axsome at its peak.\n\nAnd with Axsome's market cap fairly modest at $3.7 billion, this can still be a good investment to buy, although the company remains unprofitable at the moment and it comes with more risk than the other two stocks on this list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "1 Solid Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Not Named Nvidia to Buy Right Now Before It Soars",
        "content": "There is no doubt that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market over the past year thanks to huge demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips the company sells. But this is precisely the reason why investors may be looking for other ways to tap the AI boom.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia stock's 239% surge in 2023 made the stock expensive. It now sports a price-to-sales ratio of about 27 and a trailing earnings multiple of 65. Nvidia seems capable of justifying those multiples with impressive growth.\n\nThe company is expected to finish the current fiscal year with a 118% jump in revenue to $59 billion, followed by another jump of 56% in the next one. It may even grow at a faster pace than what consensus estimates are projecting. But still, some investors may be on the hunt for cheaper alternatives.\n\nThis is where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, steps in. The chip stock is expected to deliver solid growth in 2024, and is trading at significantly cheaper multiples than Nvidia. Let's look at the reasons why investors might want to consider buying TSMC right now.\n\nTSMC is playing a vital role in the AI chip market\n\nThe AI chips that Nvidia sells are manufactured by its foundry partner TSMC, which is why TSMC seems a solid bet for investors seeking an alternative AI chip play. Shares of the Taiwan-based company jumped 40% in 2023, underperforming the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, which clocked much stronger growth of 66%. However, that's good news for opportunistic investors, as TSMC stock is trading at a much cheaper valuation than Nvidia's.\n\nTSMC sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19, which is lower than the company's five-year average P/E ratio of 22. Investors can consider buying TSMC stock hand over fist at its current valuation, as revenue and earnings growth are expected to pick up impressively in 2024. More specifically, TSMC's revenue was predicted to decline almost 9% in 2023 to $69 billion thanks to the weak demand for smartphones and personal computers (PCs). AI, however, is likely to change the picture this year.\n\nStory continues TSM Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs the chart above shows, TSMC is expected to post 20%-plus revenue growth rates over the next couple of years. A key reason why TSMC's growth is likely to accelerate is that the company's advanced chips, which are manufactured using 5-nanometer (nm) and 3-nm process nodes, are in strong demand from the likes of Nvidia. These advanced chips are manufactured using TSMC's advanced packaging technology, known as chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS).\n\nMarket research firm IDC estimates that CoWoS packaging capacity is expected to jump a whopping 130% in the second half of 2024. In other words, sales of TSMC's AI chips are likely to take off, as the company will be in a position to boost shipments this year and bridge the 20% demand-supply gap that currently exists in CoWoS packaging.\n\nIt is also worth noting that TSMC could win big from the growing adoption of its 3nm chips in the long run, as this process node is expected to help chipmakers create $1.5 trillion worth of chips over the next five years. All this explains why TSMC's bottom-line growth is set to accelerate as well. TSM EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHow much upside can investors expect?\n\nAssuming TSMC does hit $7.72 per share in earnings in 2025, as the chart above indicates, and trades at its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 21.3 at that time, its stock price could reach $165 in two years. That would represent a 58% jump from current levels.\n\nHowever, TSMC stock could jump higher if the market rewards it with a higher earnings multiple. It is worth noting that TSMC's forward earnings multiple is cheaper than the 29 average forward P/E of the Nasdaq-100 index, which can serve as a proxy for tech stocks considering that it is mostly made up of tech stocks.\n\nIf TSMC trades at 29 times forward earnings in a couple of years, the company's stock could jump to $224 based on projected 2025 earnings. That points toward an even bigger upside of 115% from current levels. All this shows why investors would do well to buy TSMC stock while it is still cheap since it could soar impressively in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024 and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Although 2023 was a stellar year for the stock market, volatility has been the name of the game for much of the past four years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began.\n\nWhen volatility picks up on Wall Street, professional and everyday investors have a tendency to seek out companies that offer a history of outperformance. For the past two and a half years, it's stocks enacting splits that have fit the bill. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn simple terms, a stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact on its market cap or operations. Think of it as a purely cosmetic procedure that can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors (i.e., a forward-stock split), or can increase a publicly traded company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (i.e., a reverse stock split).\n\nWhile there are instances of companies conducting reverse-stock splits and going on to deliver big-time gains for their shareholders (e.g., Booking Holdings), most investors are laser-focused on companies conducting forward-stock splits. That's because forward splits are enacted by high-flying companies that have often out-innovated and handily out-executed their competition.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, nine prominent companies have completed a forward-stock split:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 split Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 20-for-1 split DexCom(NASDAQ: DXCM): 4-for-1 split Shopify(NYSE: SHOP): 10-for-1 split Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 20-for-1 split Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 3-for-1 split Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW): 3-for-1 split Monster Beverage(NASDAQ: MNST): 2-for-1 split Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO): 2-for-1 split NVDA Chart\n\nEvery single one of these businesses is a dominant player with well-defined competitive advantages in their respective industries. For example, Nvidia's graphics processing units are the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Amazon accounts for roughly 40% of U.S. online retail sales, Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, and DexCom is a top-two producer of continuous glucose monitoring systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the individual outlooks for these nine stock-split stocks differs greatly in 2024 (and beyond). Whereas one stock-split stock is historically inexpensive and primed for additional upside, another highflier appears to be headed for a breakdown.\n\nThe stock-split stock to buy hand over fist in 2024: Alphabet\n\nThough all nine of these prominent companies have run circles around the benchmark S&P 500 over the long run, it's Alphabet that stands out as the stock-split stock to buy hand over fist in the new year. Alphabet is the parent company of popular internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube.\n\nThe biggest \"problem\" (if you want to call it that) for Alphabet is that it's cyclical. Approximately 78% of the company's third-quarter revenue is derived from advertising. When the slightest hint of trouble is detected by businesses, it's not uncommon for them to quickly pare back their ad spending. This leaves Alphabet susceptible to weakness during recessions. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest an economic downturn is in the cards for 2024.\n\nHowever, this is a two-sided coin that's far from proportionate. Though it's true that recessions are a perfectly normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, only three of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II have lasted at least 12 months. Further, not a single one has surpassed 18 months.\n\nBy comparison, most economic expansions endure multiple years, with two periods of post-World-War-II growth lasting more than a decade. In short, ad-driven businesses are well positioned to succeed as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nAlphabet's clearest competitive advantage has long been its search engine, Google. In November, Google totaled 91.54% of worldwide search share, according to data from GlobalStats. You'd have to go back to March 2015 to find the last month Google hasn't accounted for at least 90% of global internet search share. Being the undisputed go-to for advertisers wanting to reach users has afforded the company exceptional ad-pricing power in virtually any economic climate. This moat isn't going away in 2024.\n\nThe new year should also feature double-digit growth opportunities for two of Alphabet's fast-growing ancillary segments. YouTube is the second most visited social site in the world, with more than 2.7 billion monthly active users. Rapid growth in Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds) should put ad-pricing power in YouTube's corner.\n\nThere's also Google Cloud, which has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, based on estimates from Canalys, as of the third quarter. Enterprise cloud spending still has a long growth runway, and Google Cloud looks to have made the permanent shift to recurring profitability.\n\nDespite sustained double-digit earnings growth potential over the next five years (if not well beyond), Alphabet stock can be purchased for roughly 14 times estimated cash flow per share in 2024. That's a 20% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the past five years. The Model 3 is Tesla's top-selling sedan. Image source: Tesla.\n\nThe stock-split stock worth avoiding in 2024: Tesla\n\nTo quote the most famous investment disclaimer on Wall Street: \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\" Although EV maker Tesla has made a habit of proving naysayers wrong for more than a decade, it's the clear stock-split stock to avoid in 2024 for a variety of reasons.\n\nBefore digging into those reasons, allow me to give credit where credit is due. As of right now, Tesla is the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's profitable on a recurring basis. While there are other profitable automakers, none of the legacy companies are generating a recurring profit from their electric-only divisions. When Tesla reports its fourth-quarter operating results, I'd expect it to wrap up its fourth consecutive year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit.\n\nUnfortunately for the world's largest automaker by market cap, its first-mover advantages are beginning to wane, and there are very evident cracks in its foundation.\n\nThe most front-and-center evidence that Tesla is in trouble can be seen via its operating margin, which has been more than halved to 7.6% over the trailing year, ended Sept. 30.\n\nIn 2023, North America's leading EV company slashed prices on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions. Based on comments provided by CEO Elon Musk during the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, these price cuts were based solely on demand. With vehicle inventory levels rising, it's plainly evident that demand for the company's EVs has declined. It also suggests that additional price cuts may be necessary to keep inventory levels under control as Tesla continues to ramp up its production.\n\nAnother potential problem with Tesla is how it's deriving its income. During the third quarter, Tesla booked $554 million in profit from selling renewable energy credits given to it for free by governments. It also generated $282 million in interest income from its sizable cash pile. That's $836 million in pre-tax income -- 41% of the company's pre-tax income in the third quarter -- that can be traced back to unsustainable sources.\n\nAlthough Elon Musk is a big reason Tesla has been such a success since going public in 2010, he's also a genuine liability for shareholders. Putting aside that he's drawn the attention of securities regulators on a couple of occasions, his biggest flaw is that he regularly overpromises new innovations (including new EVs) and fails to deliver them. Tesla's enormous valuation looks to be based on countless promises from Musk that remain unfulfilled.\n\nLastly, Tesla's efforts to become more than a car company have mostly missed the mark. Its ancillary segments generate low margins, while auto margins continue to fall. Whereas most auto stocks trade between 6 and 8 times forward-year earnings, Tesla is valued at 65 times consensus earnings in 2024. That's not a valuation that's going to hold up in the face of a rapidly declining operating margin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Are in invested in enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) company C3.ai (NYSE:AI) for the long term, or are you expecting a moonshot in 2024’s first quarter? It’s fine to be bullish about C3.ai in general, but be sure to keep your expectations in check when it comes to AI stock. Otherwise, you won’t be prepared to ride out the speed bumps along the way.\n\nThere’s no denying that C3.ai stock performed well in 2023. Yet, C3.ai wasn’t the star of the show – not even close. So, don’t assume that the coming year will bring spectacular returns. If you plan to invest in C3.ai, the best strategy is to keep your position size small and don’t look at the stock price every day or even every month.\n\nCould AI Stock Bring 10x Returns?\n\nI don’t disagree with InvestorPlace contributor Joel Baglole, who identified AI stock as a possible target for 1,000% growth by 2030. This is entirely possible if the machine-learning trend persists beyond the hype phase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd make no mistake about it: 2023 was the generative AI hype phase. Plus, the big move in C3.ai stock can’t fully be attributed to the company’s growth. Frankly, C3.ai only caught Wall Street’s attention because it rode the coattails of ChatGPT developer OpenAI and AI-processor superstar Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nFurthermore, C3.ai’s news page provided a few updates for December. There was C3.ai’s second-quarter fiscal-2024 financial report, which indicated 17% year-over-year revenue growth. This sounds like slow-and-steady growth, not the makings of another moonshot.\n\nBesides, C3.ai’s subscription revenue, which is the company’s bread and butter, increased 12% year over year. Again, that’s decent but not mind-blowing.\n\nC3.ai CEO Signals Large-Scale Capital Spend\n\nSince C3.ai lost 59 cents per share in Q2 FY2024 on a GAAP-measured basis, one might expect the company to exercise strict fiscal discipline in order to achieve profitability. Yet, C3.ai CEO Tom Siebel seems to be signaling more spending, not less.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of fiscal 2024’s second quarter, C3.ai had $762.3 million worth of cash, cash equivalents and investments. Let’s be generous and round that up to $800 million. Now, imagine you’re an accountant. Would you recommend that C3.ai should quickly spend that capital?\n\nSiebel seems to suggest that C3.ai ought to invest in it rather than save it:\n\n“I have almost $800 million in the bank… What else am I supposed to do with it? I’m investing it in the business. There’s an economic imperative to do it. To not do it would not be rational.”\n\nAdvocates of fiscal discipline might strongly disagree. There’s no guarantee that the generative AI hype train will keep rolling at the same speed in 2024 that it did in 2023. Consequently, if Siebel is hellbent on spending C3.ai’s capital in the near future, this could greatly impede the company’s near-term profitability prospects.\n\nC3.ai Stock: Stay In, but Stay Small\n\nDon’t get the wrong idea. C3.ai is part of the AI technology trend. However, it’s not pulling the sector forward like OpenAI and Nvidia are.\n\nAdditionally, C3.ai’s bottom line might suffer if the company spends a lot of money in 2024. Hence, investors should weigh the near-term risks of AI stock. The best strategy is to stay in the trade for years, not months. And most importantly, even if you fully believe in C3.ai, maintain a small position size at all times.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Last year was more for stock pickers than a year where all sectors and stocks surged. Further, there were multi-bagger returns from blue-chip as well as growth stocks. Among the hottest blue-chips, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) skyrocketed by almost 240%. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock also had a healthy rally of 48%. These were some blue-chips that outperformed many growth stocks.\n\nFor the current year, I expect a similar trend. It’s unlikely that there will be a euphoric market rally. However, there will be stories that grab the limelight and surge higher. Potential rate cuts in the year’s second half will be a catalyst for upside in several stocks.\n\nAmong blue-chip stocks, this column discusses three ideas that can trend higher by 30% to 50% before the end of 2024. These are fundamentally strong stories that have positive tailwinds.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s discuss the reasons for bullish on these hot blue-chip stocks.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Interior of the Tesla Model 3\n\nSource: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was in a comeback mode last year with a rally of over 100%. I believe TSLA will be among the hottest blue-chips this year. It’s worth noting that in July 2023, the stock touched highs of $300. This has been followed by some correction and consolidation, and TSLA stock trades at $250. Backed by positive business news, I expect a renewed rally.\n\nEven amidst scaling-up challenges, Cybertruck mass deliveries in the coming quarters will be a growth catalyst. There are speculations that the current backlog is over two million and the Cybertruck will be sold out for years to come.\n\nAnother interesting development on the cards is the possibility of Tesla’s first plant in India in the state of Gujarat. There is a possibility of the potential launch of affordable cars as Tesla explores new emerging markets.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Tesla has a strong balance sheet with $27 billion in cash and equivalents. Further, for the first nine months of 2023, Tesla reported operating cash flow of $8.9 billion. With high financial flexibility, Tesla is well-positioned to make some big investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Gold bars and Financial concept, studio shots. Costco's gold bars, cost stock\n\nSource: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsidering the upside in gold and the possibility of multiple rate cuts this year, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is among the hottest blue-chip to buy. NEM stock has been subdued with negative returns of 12% in the last 12 months. I am betting on a 30% to 50% upside from current levels in the coming quarters.\n\nAn obvious reason to like Newmont is an investment grade balance sheet. The Company has a strong liquidity buffer of $6.2 billion. Further, net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDAX of 0.7 points to headroom for leveraging. Recently, the Company completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining (OTCMKTS:NCMGF). This will help in boosting production and cash flows.\n\nIt’s worth noting that for the first nine months of 2023, Newmont reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion. With an upside in the gold price, Newmont is likely to deliver an annual EBITDA of more than $4 billion this year. An increase in cash flows will be associated with healthy dividend growth.\n\nChevron Corporation (CVX) Chevron (CVX) sing with \"diesel,\" \"food mart\" and \"car wash\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is another blue-chip stock that has been depressed in the last 12 months. The reason is a correction in crude oil prices on the back of global growth deceleration. However, with potential rate cuts, there are hopes of growth acceleration in 2025. This factor will likely be discounted in crude oil in the coming quarters. I, therefore, expect a strong comeback for CVX stock.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Chevron is on an aggressive investment spree. For the current year, the Company expects to invest $16 billion. However, the target is to scale up capital investments in the range of $19 to $22 billion once the acquisition of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is completed. Robust investments coupled with acquisitions will ensure production growth and a healthy reserve replacement.\n\nAn important point is that Chevron can invest $22 billion annually from internal cash flows. Even with the relatively depressed oil price, Chevron reported an operating cash flow of $9.7 billion for Q3 2023. Cash flows are likely to swell this year and provide ample headroom for aggressive investments coupled with dividend growth. All in all, it’s one of those hottest blue-chips stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Futures edge lower, Tesla's China-made EV sales surge - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point lower on Wednesday after a mostly downbeat start to 2024 in the prior session. Markets are now awaiting the publication of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting and, with it, potential clues into the central bank's interest rate path in the coming months. Elsewhere, sales of Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) China-made cars soar in December, but Elon Musk's electric vehicle giant is still grappling with fierce competition in the country.\n\n1. Futures inch lower\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down on Wednesday, as investors looked ahead to the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.\n\nBy 05:09 ET (10:09 GMT), the Dow futures contract had dipped by 56 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had shed 11 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had fallen by 76 points or 0.4%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both lost ground in the first day of trading of 2024, weighed down in part by ebbing hopes that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts early this year. Meanwhile, the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained just under 0.1%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sunk by around 4% after analysts at Barclays downgraded their rating of the iPhone maker, citing weak hardware demand and concerns over revenue at its services division. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- who, along with Apple, form part of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech firms that helped drive a stellar 2023 for stocks -- also declined.\n\n\"The impressive rally into year[-]end has faded a bit despite the seasonal tailwinds, but we expect the loss of short[-]term momentum to be modest,\" analysts at Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients.\n\n2. U.S. Treasury yields climb\n\nAlso denting stocks on Tuesday was a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, in a possible sign that markets' excitement over the prospect of Fed rate cuts early this year may be easing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year note -- a key gauge of long-term estimates for borrowing costs -- briefly touched an over two-week high, while the yield rate-sensitive 2-year also moved up. Prices typically fall as yields increase.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield was under 3.9% following a strong rally to cap off the year that was driven by expectations for early Fed rate cuts and a so-called \"soft landing\" for the U.S. economy. In this scenario, the Fed's aggressive rate hiking campaign successfully cools inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.\n\nBolstered by the jump in Treasury yields, the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its currency pairs, had its best daily performance since March 2023.\n\n3. Fed minutes ahead\n\nTraders are now turning their attention to the minutes from the Fed's December gathering, which are due out at 19:00 GMT on Wednesday.\n\nHow officials see borrowing costs evolving in the coming months could factor into the staying power of recent bets that the U.S. central bank will soon begin to bring down interest rates from a more than two-decade high.\n\nIn December, the Fed left rates unaltered at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, but signaled that its unprecedented tightening cycle aimed at corraling elevated inflation may have peaked. New forecasts from policymakers also suggested that they may slash rates by 75 basis points this year, an outlook that was more dovish than prior projections.\n\nSpeculation over potential rate reductions fueled a late-year surge in stocks, although many officials have since attempted to temper this enthusiasm. The minutes could provide even more insight into the Fed's thinking.\n\n4. Sales of Tesla's China-made EVs surge in December\n\nSales of Tesla's electric vehicles (EVs) made in China surged by 68.7% on a yearly basis last month, new data from the China Passenger Car Association showed on Wednesday, although the U.S. carmaker still faces intense competition in the country.\n\nThe December total, which includes exports, brought Tesla's annual amount of China-made sales up to 947,742 -- just over half of the company's global deliveries.\n\nTesla's Shanghai plant is its largest production hub, supplying China and other countries like New Zealand and Australia. The group has outlined plans to expand its EV capacity at the factory, but the move has yet to receive regulatory approval from Beijing.\n\nThe latest CPCA numbers come after China's BYD (SZ:002594) unseated Tesla as the world's biggest EV maker earlier this week. BYD, who offers both battery-only and hybrid options, delivered 341,043 passenger cars in December, an increase of 45% year-on-year.\n\n5. Oil slips\n\nOil prices retreated Wednesday, ahead of the release of crucial weekly inventories data from the U.S., the world’s largest consumer.\n\nBy 05:09 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $69.94 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.5% to $75.53 per barrel.\n\nU.S. crude stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute industry group are due later Wednesday, a day later than usual due to Monday’s New Year’s holiday. Official data will then be published on Thursday.\n\nThe crude benchmarks had climbed sharply earlier in the week after attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels raised concerns over potential supply disruptions through this key region.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures edge lower, Tesla's China-made EV sales surge - what's moving markets\n\nFed minutes may elaborate on coming rate cut debate\n\nPoliticisation of trade is immoral and unsustainable, China says",

        "title": "Down 77% from Highs, Can Coupang Stock (NYSE:CPNG) Recover in 2024?",
        "content": "While the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index (NDX) surged 43% in 2023, many of these gains were driven by mega-cap stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, e-commerce stocks such as Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) trailed the broader markets. CPNG stock rose “just” 10% in 2023 and is 77% below its all-time high. While Coupang has underperformed since its 2021 IPO, I’m bullish on the stock for 2024 due to its expanding addressable market, strong revenue growth, and improving profit margin.\n\nAn Overview of Coupang\n\nCoupang is a South Korea-based e-commerce company. It has two primary business segments, including Product Commerce and Developing Offerings. Coupang sells various products and services across categories such as home goods, apparel, beauty, home goods, electronics, and more.\n\nAdditionally, Coupang offers Rocket Fresh, a grocery delivery platform, while Coupang Eats provides restaurant ordering and delivery services. The tech company also has Coupang Play, an online content streaming platform.\n\nIn order to boost customer engagement rates, Coupang has invested heavily in infrastructure and technology. It has built more than 100 fulfillment centers spanning roughly 50 million square feet, housing millions of products. Coupang emphasized that 70% of the Korean population lives within seven miles of a Coupang logistics center.\n\nThe company now aims to leverage its capabilities in artificial intelligence and machine learning to better predict consumer demand, enabling it to deploy products across its network of fulfillment centers. Coupang is also banking on technology to dynamically route hundreds of millions of orders efficiently.\n\nHow Were Coupang’s Recent Q3 Results?\n\nDespite a challenging macro environment in 2023, Coupang increased its net revenues by 21% year-over-year to $6.2 billion in Q3. Further, the number of active customers on the Coupang platform grew by 14% to 20.4 million in the quarter. Comparatively, its gross profits rose by 27% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, indicating a margin of 25.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoupang ended the September quarter with an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $239 million, indicating a margin of 3.9%. In the last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA stood at $991 million, as it improved margins by 490 basis points.\n\nUnlike several other e-commerce tech stocks, Coupang has been reporting positive cash flows consistently. In the last four quarters, Coupang’s operating cash flow stood at $2.6 billion, while free cash flow was $1.9 billion, indicating that the company spent $700 million in capital expenditures.\n\nIn the year-ago period, Coupang reported an operating cash outflow of $200 million, while its free cash outflow was much higher at $1 billion.\n\nCoupang stated that its revenue and active customer growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter in Q3, as its Developing Offerings generated 40% revenue growth in the quarter. Moreover, Coupang expanded Rocket Delivery in Taiwan and helped around 12,000 small businesses to export products to new markets in the last 12 months.\n\nDuring the company’s recent earnings call, CEO Gaurav Anand stated, “We’ve expanded profitability while making investments in Developing Offerings, and we expect our consolidated margin to continue its march upwards on an annual basis.”\n\nCoupang Acquires Farfetch\n\nLast month, Coupang announced the acquisition of Farfetch Holdings, an online luxury company. The acquisition positions Coupang as a leader in the global personal luxury goods segment valued at $400 billion.\n\nCoupang believes its operational excellence and innovative logistics network, combined with Farfetch’s widening ecosystem in the luxury market, should help it drive experiences for customers and brands globally.\n\nAlternatively, the acquisition of Farfetch might strain Coupang’s balance sheet. In the first six months of 2023, Farfetch lost over $440 million while sales stood at $1.1 billion.\n\nThe acquisition agreement will provide Farfetch with $500 million of capital, shoring up the company’s liquidity in the near term.\n\nIs Coupang Stock Undervalued?\n\nAnalysts tracking Coupang stock expect its sales to rise by 17% to $24.08 billion for 2023 and by 13.3% to $27.27 billion for full-year 2024. Comparatively, it is forecast to end 2024 with adjusted earnings of $0.44 per share compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 expected for 2023.\n\nSo, priced at 1.2x forward sales and 37.1x 2024 earnings, CPNG stock is not too expensive, given its growth estimates.\n\nHowever, there is a good chance that the acquisition of Farfetch might result in lower profit margins for the e-commerce player. Nonetheless, Coupang ended Q3 with $4.9 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in debt, providing it with enough liquidity to navigate the current macro environment and acquire Farfetch.\n\nIs CPNG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOut of the six analysts covering CPNG stock, two recommend a Buy, three recommend a Hold, and one recommends a Sell. The average CPNG stock price target is $19.52, which is 24.1% above the current price.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nCoupang is among the largest e-commerce companies in South Korea, and it will gain access to several other markets once the acquisition of Farfetch is closed. I expect the stock to gain momentum in the next 12 months, especially if it can successfully integrate Farfetch and benefit from operational synergies as well as stable profit margins.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks have been top performers in the market. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) blowout earnings brought more attention to the space and created a gold rush of sorts. While many AI stocks have been scorching hot, investors have to discern the winners from the richly valued investments.\n\nThe best AI stocks can continue to deliver robust gains in the years ahead. High gains in the past do not indicate a stock is overvalued. Pinpoint stocks with reasonable valuations and robust financial growth can strengthen your portfolio.\n\nInvestors looking for exposure to AI stocks may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoursera (COUR) The app page for Coursera is displayed on a smartphone screen with a website in the background.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoursera (NYSE:COUR) is an online education platform that features thousands of online courses from universities, corporations, and other entities. Students can receive degrees, certifications, and other accolades for completing courses on the platform.\n\nCoursera uses artificial intelligence to make training course recommendations and help students finish the material. In fact, the company makes money from a monthly subscription and by receiving a percentage of tuition payments processed on its platform. They collaborate with over 300 leading universities and companies to give students many choices.\n\nA poorly timed IPO makes the stock gains look unimpressive over the past five years. Specifically, the company went public in 2021 when many tech companies hit their peak. However, shares rallied by over 50% in 2023. A 21% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase in the third quarter contributed to the stock’s outperformance.\n\nCollege enrollments have been declining as more people question whether college is necessary and if student debt is worth it. Although enrollments are decreasing, students still need ways to learn. If this trend continues, Coursera stands to benefit as students get online degrees and certifications to save money.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) offers cloud networking services and hardware for large data centers.

In fact, ANET’s net profit margin exceeded 35% for the quarter.\n\nThe stock trades at a 32 forward P/E ratio which means it depends on continued revenue and earnings growth to justify the valuation. ANET has been a consistent top performer, which reflects the company’s ability to generate strong financials each year.

        "title": "Wall Street’s 7 Favorite Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "As we enter 2024, it’s wise to pause and reevaluate your investment portfolio, shaking things up for the year ahead. With each new year comes shifting sentiment on Wall Street. However, many top-performing stocks from 2023 could continue gaining momentum this year. Tracking which companies analysts are most bullish on provides useful insight for investors with medium-term investing time horizons.\n\nBig tech stocks often land on analysts’ buy lists, some after already appreciating significantly. While these familiar names may not make you an overnight millionaire, they should anchor your portfolio. I’ll spotlight seven stocks that Wall Street analysts have tagged as hot buys for 2024 based on positive ratings. Note, a reminder: analyst ratings aren’t foolproof market prophecies. However, they do offer a valuable peek into current Wall Street perspectives.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s dive in!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the top dog in the e-commerce sector by a wide margin, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains analysts’ darling pick in this space for 2024. With a stellar 42 “buy” ratings against zero “hold” or “sell” ratings over the last three months, Wall Street is extremely bullish on AMZN stock. I know some may balk at Amazon’s seemingly steep valuation. But with online shopping becoming more ingrained for the consumer (especially among digital-native Gen Zers), I’m willing to pay a premium for this proven winner.\n\nStatistaforecasts nearly 11% annualized global e-commerce growth through 2027, and Amazon should capture much of those dollars. The company’s earnings per share are estimated to grow from $2.69 in 2023 to more than $11.30 by 2032. To me, that long-term profit trajectory justifies Amazon’s current market value, and then some. Paired with low double-digit sales growth expected through 2029, I see ample upside ahead.\n\nBetween Gen Z’s digital preferences and the overall momentum of e-commerce, Amazon’s pole position in this space should equate to big returns over time. This tech titan remains as hungry as ever – a terrific stock to own in 2024 and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlashback to mid-2022 when Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) crashed to $90 per share. Despite the prevalent bearishness at the time, I stayed bullish on this company based on Meta’s rock-solid core business. Fast forward 18 months, and META stock is now trading around $346 per share.\n\nWall Street sees blue skies ahead as well. In fact, Meta nets 36 “buy” recommendations against just one “hold.” From 2023 to 2028, the company’s earnings per share could double on the back of still-robust double-digit annual revenue growth. Indeed, lingering anxiety over Meta’s metaverse dreams has proven temporary. The company’s “Family of Apps” division, not virtual reality, is Meta’s cash cow, and that business is doing just fine.\n\nMeta’s coffers will continue to grow so long as eyeballs remain glued to Facebook and Instagram. Consider Generation Z: though often portrayed as generally being “over” Facebook, most in these age groups still have an account. Additionally, Instagram remains wildly popular with teens. As long as users show up, advertisers will, too. With ample room for untapped global growth, Meta has plenty of upside left.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) retains its spot as a darling among Wall Street analysts, and for good reason. This tech titan scarcely flinched during the recent overall market slide and has rebounded forcefully to fresh highs. While Microsoft’s impressive AI initiatives capture tremendous fanfare, we can’t ignore its breadth across cloud, software, and hardware.\n\nLook no further than Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing segment, for instance. Azure’s revenue popped 29% last quarter. Thus, Microsoft is now encroaching on Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) turf via fledgling search and browser initiatives.\n\nNotably, MSFT stock also has 36 “buy” ratings against just one “hold,” with Wall Street remaining keen on Microsoft, as I am. This company has its hands in so many cookie jars (AI is just one example) that I expect substantial growth ahead. Buckle up for the ride!\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) The Uber logo is displayed on a smartphone on top of a map background.\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of software’s biggest recent success stories, Uber (NYSE:UBER) has surged to new all-time highs in recent weeks. Propelled by robust momentum and an impeccable balance sheet, Uber certainly looks like a juggernaut in the making. It’s no shock that Uber earns 35 resounding “buy” ratings among analysts against just one lone “hold” rating.\n\nNo doubt, Uber’s growth trajectory impresses mightily. The company’s earnings per share could leap from $1.15 in 2024 all the way to $6.61 in 2032, if growth remains on track. However, with 2024 earnings putting Uber’s forward price-to-earnings ratio above 53-times, I concur with that solitary “hold” rating. Despite turbocharged profit growth expected ahead, today’s rich valuation gives me reason to pause. Uber’s forward multiple will sink to around 9-times if everything goes perfectly based on 2032 income projections. But paying upfront for these earnings means investors are forced to assume some pretty significant risk.\n\nUnlike entrenched tech titans, Uber operates within the concentrated rideshare niche and is still working toward mainstream adoption. I believe waiting for a better entry point seems to be the smart play before biting on a stock trading at over 9-times potential 2032 earnings today. Long-term bulls may toss aside my caution and buy regardless, and that I think is not a bad idea if you want to hold for decades.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLooking back to March 2023 when I first touted CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), its blistering growth metrics were undoubtedly mouthwatering. But with its valuation now stretching beyond 85-times forward earnings and 20-times forward sales, I’m balking – even with CrowdStrike garnering 34 “buy” recommendations against just 2 “hold” ratings from Wall Street analysts.\n\nWithout question, cybersecurity industry tailwinds should continue to propel CrowdStrike to new heights over this coming decade. However, paying today’s extremely steep premium seems awfully hard to justify when even the most optimistic 2033 revenue projections still put CRWD stock at almost 3-times next year’s sales. Only the most eager bulls could try rationalizing buying at such current nosebleed levels.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike CrowdStrike, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to bake highly optimistic growth assumptions into its currently lofty valuation. Sure, Nvidia has knocked recent quarterly earnings reports out of the park. But looking ahead, risks definitely loom large, both from AI chipmaking rivals rapidly narrowing the technology gap along with uncertainty permeating the still-emerging and largely unprofitable AI landscape overall.\n\nI believe Wall Street largely overestimates Nvidia’s future prospects, while seriously discounting the competitive and industry headwinds that could plausibly dampen growth. Nvidia earns an overwhelmingly positive 31 “buy” ratings against three mere “hold” ratings. Analysts clearly envisage blue skies dominating ahead. I respectfully disagree with that upbeat prognosis, and suggest prospective investors wait for a better entry point before jumping aboard.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) falls into the same frothy camp. This company has posted stellar market-beating performance in previous quarters, and holds a leadership position in the cybersecurity space. However, PANW stock appears to be priced to sheer perfection. Especially compared to high-flying cybersecurity peer CrowdStrike, Palo Alto’s top-line growth metrics look rather pedestrian moving forward. Yet, PANW stock still trades at remarkably rich earnings multiples, even when looking at 2033 projections.\n\nWith 30 “buy” ratings against just 4 “hold” ratings, Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly endorse Palo Alto Networks. However, I believe waiting for an inevitable pullback should deliver much better risk-reward upside for investors not currently holding this stock. I’d personally replace these cybersecurity picks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) if it weren’t for my basing these picks purely using Wall Street ratings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Underrated Stock Gems Hiding in Plain Sight",
        "content": "With 2023 being largely about the usual suspects, investors may be better served in the new year targeting under-rated stocks. We’re talking about fundamentally undervalued or underappreciated ideas that really didn’t much airtime compared to their peers. However, with a fresh calendar ahead of us, circumstances could change favorably.\n\nMostly, the bullishness toward overlooked stocks centers on shifting fundamentals. It’s too early to call but the Federal Reserve has hinted at the possibility of interest rate cuts this year. If so, that would represent a massive paradigm shift compared to the hawkish monetary policies of 2022 and 2023. Therefore, investors should also adjust their expectations.\n\nOn another point, last year’s winners aren’t guaranteed to deliver the same results this year. For example, seemingly everybody was talking about semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2023. It gained 246% for the year. However, in the trailing six months, NVDA only moved up less than 17%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, this might be a time to give the below hidden gem stocks a chance.\n\nAllstate (ALL) Allstate Insurance office\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet’s be real – Allstate (NYSE:ALL) is boring as you-know-what. An insurance specialist, ALL managed to gain a blistering 2.4% in 2023. Yeah, don’t knock us over with your robust performance. However, the upcoming fundamentals in 2024 and beyond may shine favorably for Allstate. It’s probably not going to a portfolio monster. However, it should keep the sticks moving.\n\nFundamentally, the insurance industry should benefit from lower interest rates. Basically, insurance companies pad their total return with diverse portfolio holdings. In particular, these entities love buying government bonds. If borrowing costs decline, the bonds that Allstate and its ilk hold would be worth more because the yield would be fixed at a higher rate compared to newly issued bonds.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, lower interest rates may increase risk-on sentiment across the board. If so, demand for more insurance products may likewise rise. Currently, Allstate posts an outstanding three-year revenue growth rate of 14.2%, yet it trades at a lowly 0.66X trailing-year revenue.\n\nStated differently, ALL is on a discount that few seem to appreciate. Thus, it’s one of the under-rated stocks to buy.\n\nMurphy Oil (MUR) Murphy Oil (MUR) logo on the website homepage.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Murphy Oil (NYSE:MUR) engages in hydrocarbon exploration. In other words, it features relevancies in the upstream component of the energy value chain. However, the underlying market didn’t perform so well last year. In part, economic concerns weighed on the sector despite oil-producing nations artificially introducing production cuts.\n\nHowever, if the mighty Fed decides to lower borrowing costs, the oil market would likely rise. Basically, lower rates would devalue the dollar relative to other currencies. And since commodities – including hydrocarbon energy resources – are priced in dollars, oil should rise. That could benefit MUR as one of the under-rated stocks to buy.\n\nAlso, while electric vehicles pose downwind competitive concerns for Murphy and its ilk, a mass-scale transition won’t occur overnight. Let’s not forget that people are still hurting from various headwinds in the past few years. However, these headwinds may fade, which means that MUR – presently trading at 9.11X trailing-year earnings – may be a discount.\n\nUnited Microelectronics (UMC) Semiconductors chips and blurred UMC United Microelectronics Corporation logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio via shutterstock\n\nBased in Taiwan, United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) is a semiconductor foundry. That means United doesn’t design its own chips but instead manufacturers chips designed by other companies. It’s effectively a “contract manufacturer” and thus plays an important role in the global semiconductor value chain. Still, UMC only gained 28% in 2023, which is modest compared to many other chip plays.\n\nHowever, circumstances could change favorably for United, making UMC one of the overlooked stocks. According to the company’s website, United plays an important role in the rollout of 5G infrastructure. Per Moror Intelligence, this sector reached a valuation of $6.69 billion last year. Further, experts project that by 2028, the segment could hit $46.78 billion.\n\nIf so, we’re talking about a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.51%. That’s simply massive. And yet, we have UMC trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.79X, even though the company also posts an above-average three-year EBITDA growth rate of 41.3%. I think UMC is easily one of the under-rated stocks to consider.\n\nAnglo American (AAUKF) The periodic table shows element 46, Palladium.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA British multinational mining firm, Anglo American (OTCMKTS:AAUKF) is a high-risk profile among under-rated stocks. You can tell that shares trade in the over-the-counter market with its funky ticker symbol. Also, as a precious metals miner, it’s liable to suffer volatility. Sure enough, in 2023, AAUKF suffered a loss of more than 35% of its equity value.\n\nFundamentally, the red ink centered on palladium and other platinum group metals (PGMs). As InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer mentioned in November, palladium prices cratered last year. Much of the problem stems from the use of the metal. About 80% of it is used for the automotive industry, specifically for making catalytic converters. But as consumers pivot to EVs, this demand profile may suffer a huge drop.\n\nStill, EV sales might not be as impressive as many experts have projected this year. Also, palladium may be used for other endeavors, particularly in the hydrogen space. Therefore, AAUKF’s lowly forward earnings multiple of 9.63X might be worth considering for speculative investors.\n\nMarriott Vacations (VAC) Beautiful beach. Chairs on the sandy beach near the sea. Summer holiday and vacation concept for tourism. Inspirational tropical landscape. Tranquil scenery, relaxing beach, tropical landscape design. SLNA stock\n\nSource: icemanphotos / Shutterstock.com\n\nThrowing more risk to the table, Marriott Vacations (NYSE:VAC) offers another look among under-rated stocks for market gamblers. As a pure-play public timeshare company, Marriot Vacations suffered from declining economic sentiment in 2023. Indeed, VAC incurred a huge drop of more than 36%. High prices, high borrowing costs and a cloudy economy took their toll.\n\nStill, if the Fed manages to engineer a soft landing, Marriot Vacations could be worth a second look. True, the high prices component would likely remain a challenge. But lower interest rates could expand the total addressable market as more people may be willing to finance timeshares. In addition, fading concerns about a debilitating recession could inspire more risk-on activities (such as targeting timeshares).\n\nFurther, VAC popped up more than 9% in the trailing month, possibly suggesting that a bottom has been printed. At the moment, shares trade for under 12X trailing-year earnings, below 72% of its peers. That could be the welcome mat for investors to label VAC as one of the hidden gem stocks.\n\nEverest Group (EG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you’re seeking under-rated stocks that just might deliver the goods this year, look no further than Everest Group (NYSE:EG). Chances are, unless you’re a big fan of insurance-related investments, you might not have heard of Everest. That makes it all the better. Gaining a bit over 6% in 2023, it’s not exactly a riveting play. However, that could change thanks to the Fed.\n\nFirst, Everest is a reinsurance company – basically, it’s an insurance company for other insurance companies. Of course, by backing up other enterprises’ risk profile, Everest needs to bolster the returns of its diverse portfolio. For many insurance-related entities, that involves a heavy dose of government bonds. Now, if policymakers lower interest rates, the bonds that Everest holds would be worth more due to the lower yield of newly issued debt securities.\n\nBut wouldn’t that positively affect other insurance players? Yes but here’s why EG could rank above other overlooked stocks in the space. Its return on equity (ROE) stands at 23.38%, beating out 88.54% of its peers. In other words, Everest is already highly efficient and lower rates should make it more so.\n\nHertz (HTZ) Hertz (HTZ) sign in Montevrain, France on May 8, 2016.\n\nSource: aureliefrance / Shutterstock.com\n\nProbably the riskiest idea among under-rated stocks on this list, Hertz (NASDAQ:HTZ) faces many questions. As you know, due to the Covid-19 disaster, the rental car service suffered an ignominious bankruptcy. It was really unavoidable when air travel all but cratered during the pandemic. However, with social trends such as revenge travel, HTZ theoretically should enjoy a favorable backdrop.\n\nUnfortunately, that hasn’t been the case. Last year, HTZ suffered a drop of nearly 31% in equity value. So yes, it may be one of the hidden gem stocks but critics will argue that it’s for a reason. Nevertheless, if the Fed goes through with interest rate cuts, Hertz could be a huge beneficiary. At the basic level, lower borrowing costs may spur discretionary expenditures, including for vacations.\n\nJust as importantly, the economy dodged the recession bullet – a recession that many thought would materialize in 2023. Likely as a result, the personal saving rate increased over the trailing-year period from November 2023. Because the downturn didn’t arrive, people may be more confident. Thus, HTZ might be one of the speculative overlooked stocks to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Can 'Magnificent Seven' continue dominating markets in 2024?",
        "content": "The high-flying 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech stocks that powered markets in 2023 seem poised to extend their leadership in 2024. According to FactSet data, six of the seven including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) are projected to rise double-digits this year, with only a negative return seen for Tesla (TSLA).\n\nYahoo Finance's Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So let's stick with the Magnificent Seven here because we know they drove record market gains in 2023. And Wall Street, optimistic the tech giants can keep that momentum going in the new year. According to estimates compiled by FactSet, the Street is projecting the Magnificent Seven stocks will rise an average of 11% in the new year, with the exception of laggard Tesla.\n\nSo as you mentioned, Julia, this is sort of that time of year, you rethink your portfolio maybe a bit. You think you know what, do I stick with the winners, right? And certainly the Magnificent Seven winners in 2023. If you piled in 12 months ago, you're probably feeling pretty good and pretty smart right about now. And there were different reasons those stocks worked last year.\n\nYou could think about AI, certainly these were companies that put so much time and effort and money into that tech, and they began to integrate that tech across their product portfolios.\n\nAnother reason obviously, some investors piled in because they thought they were defensive, right? They saw they were relatively predictable strong moats, strong balance sheets. Warren Buffett likes some of them. He's a pretty smart guy. So now the question is, do you think do you stick with that trade as we head into the new year?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, most strategists are sticking with that trade, at least the individual analysts who cover these stocks, if we look at those price targets, except for Tesla, they're all on average looking for upside here. That said, they're all expecting less upside than we saw last year without exception. All of those Magnificent Seven stocks, if you calculate the change from the close on Friday, last Friday, to the price target, we're talking about a smaller gain than they saw in 2023, or in Tesla's case, a loss.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it is optimism, but it's more muted optimism going into this year. One of the folks who's a macro person, who looks at this is David Costner over at Goldman Sachs. He says the baseline is that mega-cap tech stocks will continue to outperform the remainder of the S&P 500, although it should be said, the forecast for the S&P overall, there's a big range, but most of them are also for modest gains in the index.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: There are some, you know, dedicated tech bulls, though, who are you people are being too conservative. And I think it comes down to where the AI. And they see these companies-- and this is the very bullish case. They see these companies continuing to invest. They're going to keep integrating that tech across their products, across their services, and they just are making a bet that use cases and monetization is going to keep ramping.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. A couple of individual things that I just quickly want to mention that's going on today. One of them is that Apple shares are trading lower. They got an a rating over from Barclays that is pushing the shares down.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Very rare downgrade to sell--\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yes, exactly.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: --the iPhone. But you don't see that very often.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Time for a breather, they say. So we're going to talk more about this later, but you could argue given the size of Apple as Apple goes--\n\nJOSH LIPTON: For sure.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: --the rest of tech, and then the rest of the market goes. So that's definitely weighing on things today. On the flip side, you've got Tesla, which is out with deliveries, we're going to talk more about that later as well. And so even though the forecast is for it to decline on the year, it had been higher earlier today.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Because they beat. They beat consensus.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Now off by 2/3.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: We'll keep watching that one.",

        "title": "3 Biotech Stocks at the Forefront of the Quest for Eternal Youth",
        "content": "Americans live longer than ever, and a handful of biotech stocks stand at the forefront of longevity’s future. Many misconceive anti-aging stocks as peddling some magic pill that inexplicably makes you live longer — that perception is pure fiction. While many treatments help extend your life if leveraged properly and consistently — namely, diet and exercise — the most compelling longevity stocks address specific age-associated ailments instead.\n\nAs we age, rapid neurological and physical degeneration gives rise to a whole host of death-inducing ailments — i.e., cancer, Alzheimer’s and more. Treating these late-stage killers is where tremendous value ultimately lies. Just look to Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) as an example of biotech stocks capturing longevity trends via therapeutics. The company’s drug, Leqembi, is the first FDA-approved treatment to slow Alzheimer’s. Once announced, Biogen stock shot up 40%.\n\nBut Biogen isn’t the only game in town. Instead, look to these smaller emerging biotech stocks if you’re fighting to find the fountain of youth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDenali Therapeutics (DNLI) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nDenali Therapeutics (NASDAQ:DNLI) focuses on neurodegenerative disorders disproportionately affecting the elderly. Like Biogen, Denali seeks to extend life at the far end of the current aging spectrum. Shares took a tumble in 2023 as the firm canceled plans to continue its own Alzheimer’s drug trial amid high-dose safety concerns. But investors trading biotech stocks must be used to volatility and playing the long game despite short-term bearish sentiment. From a long-term perspective, Denali is one of today’s top longevity stocks.\n\nThe company’s current pipeline is robust, with four late-clinical therapeutics and a handful more in pre- or early-clinical testing. But, beyond its pipeline, the wide industry’s endorsement sets DNLI apart from other small-cap, speculative biotech stocks. The company enjoys a range of partnered activities with giants like Biogen. At the same time, institutional players own nearly 80% of the company’s shares. That wide approval indicates long-term bullishness in this biotech stock, even if short-term turbulence makes actively trading shares a volatile proposition.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) website displayed on a modern smartphone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarly drug discovery is a lengthy, expensive and time-consuming process. Biotech stocks don’t usually have the resources to test every possible permutation of biological targets and possible therapeutic compounds during drug discovery. But Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) is accelerating drug discovery using artificial intelligence (AI). This novel approach makes RXRX a top biotech stock to capture the broad longevity trend.\n\nRXRX’s Recursion OS platform facilitates the entire range of drug discovery, including AI-assisted biological and chemical matching, cell culture, analytics and enough robotic automation to run 2.2 million annual experiments. In RXRX’s words, its customizable platform turns “drug discovery from sequential trial-and-error into a search problem.” In other words, rather than playing an iterative guessing game to match biologics with treatments, longevity companies can digitally run through thousands (or more) combinations to find viable candidates for testing.\n\nSince RXRX offers a platform to facilitate drug discovery, its performance is ultimately agnostic to drug-specific outcomes. That means RXRX is a top biotech stock capturing the overall trend rather than betting the farm on a single drug or therapeutic. And major players are taking note. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is betting on the overall biotech and longevity trend via a $50 million investment in RXRX’s future.\n\nScholar Rock (SRRK) Scientists in a lab\n\nSource: Matej Kastelic / Shutterstock\n\nScholar Rock (NASDAQ:SRRK) targets a slightly different aging problem than most longevity stocks focused on neurological disease. Instead, Scholar Rock uses monoclonal antibodies for a range of treatments throughout its pipeline. And those treatments have huge implications for the future of longevity.\n\nThe company’s core longevity offering targets fibrosis. Fibrosis includes organ and tissue scarring that causes poor function. Cardiac fibrosis happens as we age and is a leading contributor to heart disease. That issue is a leading cause of death in America across demographic segments. If Scholar Rock can knock out this significant contributor to mortality, it could revolutionize longevity in a way other niche treatments can’t by sheer scope and reach.\n\nBetter yet for investors, Scholar Rock is capitalizing on the increasingly popular obesity treatment trend kickstarted by Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) Ozempic. Its early-stage antimyostatin treatment could help manage obesity and offer inroads into wider cardiometabolic disorders — again, the leading contributors to early mortality in America.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions (directly or indirectly) in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures saw little movement during Tuesday's overnight trading, following the NASDAQ Composite's most severe declines since October.\n\nBy 6:30 pm ET (11:30 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures and S&P 500 Futures remained little changed while Nasdaq 100 Futures ticked 0.1% higher.\n\nBloomin Brands Inc (NASDAQ:BLMN), the company behind Outback Steakhouse, experienced a more than 3% rise after announcing the addition of two new members to its board. This move was in line with an agreement the company made with activist investor, Starboard Value.\n\nThe commencement of the new year experienced a downturn in stocks, with the S&P 500 falling 0.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average merely edging up by less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite recorded a drop of more than 1.6%, marking its worst day since October. This decline was largely due to a slump in major technology stocks and a near 4% decline in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), following a downgrade by Barclays (LON:BARC).\n\nCompanies that are poised to benefit from artificial intelligence, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), experienced drops of 2.7% and 6% respectively. Meanwhile, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), both leaders in chatbot technology, lost over 1%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) fell by 3.4%, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) saw a 4.9% decrease.\n\nChris Verrone from Strategas noted on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday that the burden of proof is on the bears as we start the year. He pointed out that short-term corrections are not unusual in a market that's coming off of fresh highs and entering primary season. He also noted that the longer-term setup looks positive on a six- to twelve-month horizon.\n\nThe market is recovering from a remarkable year that witnessed all the major averages rebounding from a devastating 2022. The S&P 500 surged by over 24%, marking its longest weekly winning streak since 2004, while the Nasdaq jumped 43% for its best year since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shift back into risk assets was driven by easing inflation and a drop in the 10-year Treasury yield, which finished the year below 3.9% after reaching 5% in October. The end of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive hiking campaign and anticipation of rate cuts in 2024, along with increased hopes for a soft landing, has also boosted market sentiment in recent weeks.\n\nThe minutes from the Fed's December policy meeting, due out Wednesday, and comments from Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, could provide additional insight into the rate path ahead before the central bank meets later this month. The job openings report for November and December's ISM manufacturing data are also set for release later in the session.\n\nOn the bond markets, United States 10-Year rates were at 3.947%.\n\nUpgrade your decision-making with InvestingPro+!

        "content": "Nokia Corporation NOK declared that it is likely to fall short of its 2023 financial target. The ongoing license renewal negotiations in Nokia Technologies are unlikely to conclude within the current fiscal year. Despite the fierce discussions among involved parties and favorable court outcomes, the Finnish telecom entity is placing a strong emphasis on safeguarding its patent portfolio over rushing to match a specific timeline for resolution.\r\n\r\nOwing to these reasons, the company will not be able to incorporate the revenues generated from license renewals into its fiscal 2023 financial performance. This indicates that net sales, operating margin and free cash flow targets for the current fiscal year are likely to remain unfulfilled. However, Nokia reasserted that its strategic direction remains consistent and will adhere to the planning outlined in December across all business segments.\r\n\r\nNokia also faced headwinds owing to customers’ constrained spending behavior during the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, the company is witnessing an uptick in order rates and expects a sequential improvement in revenues from Nokia networks businesses encompassing Mobile Networks, Cloud Network and Services and Network infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe company expects the resolution to be concluded in 2024, which will boost its fiscal 2024 top line, including associated catch-up payments. Management remains optimistic that the profitability of its network businesses will continue to align with the long-term comparable operating margin expectations communicated in December 2023.\r\n\r\nNokia is well-positioned for the ongoing technology cycle, given the strength of its end-to-end portfolio. Its installed base of high-capacity AirScale products, which enables customers to upgrade to 5G quickly, is growing fast. It is driving the transition of global enterprises into smart virtual networks by creating a single network for all services, converging mobile and fixed broadband, IP routing and optical networks with the software and services to manage them. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, it is transforming the way people and things communicate and connect.\r\n\r\nNOK aims to create new business and licensing opportunities in the consumer ecosystem. It facilitates customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations by offering easy programmability and flexible automation required to support dynamic operations, reduce complexity and improve efficiency. It seeks to expand its business into targeted, high-growth and high-margin vertical markets to address growth opportunities beyond its traditional primary markets.\r\n\r\nThe stock has declined 27% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 14.2%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNokia currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.99%.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Sunoco, New Gold, Hooker Furniture Corp., Molson Coors and NVIDIA",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 2, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Sunoco SUN, New Gold NGD, Hooker Furniture Corp. HOFT, Molson Coors TAP and NVIDIA NVDA.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Investing Strategies for 2024 and Top Stocks to Buy\n\nAs the final trading day of 2023 is approaching, it's becoming evident that this year has been remarkably successful for Wall Street despite occasional ups and downs. The three primary stock market indices logged an astounding surge toward the end of the year, repeatedly hitting record highs.\n\nThis impressive performance has been driven by a surge in technology stocks, a decrease in inflationary pressures, and the growing belief that the Federal Reserve has concluded its interest rate hikes. The talks are doing rounds that the Fed may cut rates by 75 bps by the end of 2024.\n\nAmong these indices, the Nasdaq Composite has turned out as the top performer, scoring a gain of 44.3%. In the same period, the S&P 500 has climbed by 24.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial has advanced by 13.6%. It appears that this robust upward trend is poised to carry over into the New Year.\n\nIn this pursuit, investors can play top-ranked stocks like Sunoco, New Gold, Hooker Furniture Corp., Molson Coors and NVIDIA.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for the S&P 500?\n\nFundstrat's head of research Tom Lee projects that the S&P 500 benchmark index will end 2024 at 5,200 as slumping inflation leads to easing financial conditions. The U.S. economy would once again be able to avoid a recession, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Deutsche Bank and BMO Capital expect the index to hit the 5,100-mark by the end of next year.\n\nMoreover, Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets and Bank of America's Savita Subramanian believe that the S&P 500 may hit 5,000 by the end of 2024, as quoted by MarketWatch and published on Morningstar. Goldman Sachs, too, raised its S&P 500 price target for 2024 to 5,100 from 4,700 in late December.\n\nStory continues\n\nFed to Turn Dovish: Tap Dividend Stocks\n\nIn the latest meeting, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a major policy shift as inflation is easing and the economy is holding up better. He signaled three rate cuts for next year compared with the previous forecast of two rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThe federal funds rate is expected to be in the range of 4.4-4.9%, down from the current 5.25% to 5.50%. This indicates that the Fed will cut rates by a total of 0.75% next year, indicating that the historic rate-hiking campaign might be ending.\n\nAs dividend stocks perform better in a low-rate environment, investors can play Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) master limited partnership Sunoco (yields 5.57%). The stock has a VGM Score of A. Sunoco LP's prime business comprises the distribution of motor fuel to roughly 10,000 customers that include independent dealers, commercial customers, convenience stores as well as distributors.\n\nU.S. Dollar Likely to Fall: Gold to Glitter\n\nThe U.S. dollar is on its way to log the first negative year since 2020 as the Fed started offering dovish cues. We expect the greenback to lose more strength in 2024, which would be a great thing for gold investing. A weak dollar makes bullion cheaper for overseas buyers, thereby driving gold prices higher.\n\nThe allure of gold has already returned in recent months on a decline in bond yields and a weaker U.S. dollar. Lower interest rates are usually good for the non-interest-bearing asset gold.\n\nGiven the optimism, investors can play Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) New Gold. The stock, which has a VGM Score of A, is focused on the exploration and development of the Afton Copper-Gold Project, located 6 miles west of Kamloops, British Columbia.\n\nMake Big Bets on Pint-Sized Stocks\n\nSmall-cap stocks should rally ahead due to cheaper valuation, cooling inflation data and hopes of Fed rate cuts in 2024. Decent GDP growth momentum and a resilient consumer base also support the rally in small-cap stocks. Apart from these, other factors are also contributing to the rally in small-cap stocks.\n\nPer strategists, the valuation gap between large and small-cap companies, as well as private and public markets, suggests that merger and acquisition activity may pick up. Companies may find it more attractive to acquire smaller, faster-growing firms, taking advantage of the valuation discrepancy (read: 5 Reasons Why Small-Cap Stocks Can Surge in 2024: 5 Top Picks).\n\nHooker Furniture Corporation is a leading manufacturer and importer of residential furniture, primarily targeted at the upper-medium price range. The company offers diversified products, consisting primarily of home office, entertainment centers, imported occasional, bedroom and wall systems, across many style categories within this price range. This Zacks Rank #1 company has a VGM Score of A.\n\nEasing Inflation: A Plus for Consumer Discretionary Sector\n\nWhen inflation falls, certain sectors of the economy often stand to benefit more than others. Consumer Discretionary is one of them. The Consumer Discretionary sector includes companies involved in non-essential goods and services, such as luxury items, automobiles, and entertainment. Lower inflation means that consumers have more purchasing power, which can lead to increased spending on these non-essential items.\n\nHence, investors can dip their toes in alcoholic beverage companies like Molson Coors. It is a global manufacturer and seller of beer and other beverage products and has an impressive diverse portfolio of owned and partner brands. The Zacks Rank #1 company has a moderate VGM Score of B.\n\nLast But Not the Least: AI to Keep Ruling\n\nIn 2023, the technology industry emerged as the most lucrative, largely due to the explosion in artificial intelligence (AI), a less-hawkish Fed, and a significant rise in the value of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Moreover, the recent surge in this sector has been fueled by speculation that the Fed's intensive campaign of raising interest rates may soon end. Since the tech sector often depends on loans for accelerated growth, lower interest rates make it more affordable to secure additional funding for various projects.\n\nThe AI enthusiasm is anticipated to persist into 2024, as numerous experts contend that the AI initiatives of market leaders are still booming. It is expected that further breakthroughs and developments are in the cards. As an AI bet, investors can bet on Zacks Rank #2 NVIDIA. The stock has a moderate VGM Score of C.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and  CrowdStrike",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – January 2, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Riot Platforms RIOT, Marathon Digital MARA, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META and CrowdStrike CRWD.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n3 Stocks That Are Better Bets Than Cryptos in 2024\n\nThe blockchain-powered cryptocurrency made a major comeback in 2023 after a massive sell-off in 2022 on recession concerns, inflationary pressure and higher interest rates. Strong year-to-date rally in the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin, which have gained 155.35%, 95.45%, 149.44% and 33.83%, respectively, testifies to the current crypto boom.\n\nThe primary reason behind this boom is the Federal Reserve's pause on interest rate hikes. The Fed has held interest rates unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5% for the third successive meeting. It has also signaled three rate cuts in 2024.\n\nGrowing optimism among investors, owing to the fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will finally begin approving crypto spot ETF filings after stalling approval of these applications several times, remains another major positive.\n\nRisk Persists\n\nHowever, the lack of proper regulation and reliability in the cryptocurrency market remains a big concern. Increasing regulatory concerns over crypto transactions and crypto mining that witness greater governmental control are negatives.\n\nFurther, the market is highly volatile, which is a serious risk. Shares of notable bitcoin miners, namely Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital, tumbled in Thursday's trading, plunging 5.5% and 9.5%, respectively.\n\nInvestors are turning bearish about the fact that the bitcoin miners are required to make heavy investments in mining equipment, which, in turn, is making them heavily leveraged. This may lead to high volatility in the stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, Riot Platforms executed a purchase option and updated its long-term purchase agreement with MicroBT, under which it placed a purchase order for 66,560 MicroBT miners for $290.5 million. Meanwhile, Marathon announced the purchase of two Bitcoin mining sites — one in Texas and one in Nebraska — for $178.6 million.\n\nIn addition, fears of a recession in 2024 still remain. At least, the anticipation of a soft landing for the U.S. economy in 2024, which will include a slowdown in GDP growth, remains a headwind.\n\nOur Stock Picks\n\nGiven this uncertain scenario, it is a prudent idea to pick those stocks for investment purposes, which are highly reputed and financially resilient. Here, we have picked NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and CrowdStrike, which not only have taken an interest in cryptocurrencies but also have strong positions in booming markets like generative AI, social media platforms and cybersecurity, among others that are comparatively stable and hold immense growth prospects.\n\nNotably, these stocks have returned more than 100% in 2023, thanks to their fundamental strength. Apart from this, the aforementioned stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nPer Zacks' proprietary methodology, stocks with such a favorable combination offer solid investment opportunities.\n\nNVIDIA has gained 239.1% year to date. It is known to be the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU. It is witnessing the growing momentum of its GPUs in the cryptocurrency space. Nevertheless, the company's GPUs are also gaining solid momentum in generative AI and large language model-powered applications, which hold growth promises.\n\nThis apart, solid hyperscale demand and a strong uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Further, NVIDIA's collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are expected to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nCurrently, NVDA carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's fiscal 2025 earnings have moved north by 1% to $19.91 per share over the last 30 days.\n\nMeta Platforms, which has already bid adieu to its cryptocurrency project Diem, is exploring ways to use blockchain-based assets in digital payments.\n\nMeta shares have surged 197.7% on a year-to-date basis. It is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly the Asia Pacific. Increased engagement on Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. The company is experiencing traffic growth on Instagram and Facebook, owing to its usage of AI to recommend.\n\nIn addition, Meta's growing efforts in the generative AI space, into which it made its foray with Large Language Model Meta AI (\"Llama\"), remain noteworthy.\n\nCurrently, META carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's 2024 earnings have moved north by 0.1% to $17.57 per share over the last 30 days.\n\nCrowdStrike's discovery of the first-ever Dero cryptojacking operation targeting Kubernetes infrastructure remains noteworthy.\n\nNevertheless, the company is currently benefiting from the solid demand for cyber-security solutions. CRWD has rallied 145% in the year-to-date period. An increasing number of data breaches and the growing need for security and networking products due to the ongoing hybrid working trend are leading to the uptake of CRWD's solutions. Also, the digital transformation and cloud migration initiatives being taken by various organizations are expected to continue boosting the company's end-market demand.\n\nCurrently, CRWD carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's fiscal 2025 earnings have moved north by 3.4% to $3.64 per share over the last 30 days.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Incredible. These 3 Chip Stocks Could Beat It in 2024.",
        "content": "If artificial intelligence (AI) was the story of 2023, then Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the stock of the year.\n\nNo other company's products were as in demand from the generative AI boom, and no other company has the financial performance to prove it. Nvidia stock finished 2023 up 239% last year, crossing the trillion-dollar mark to become only one of five U.S. stocks to have a valuation above that line. The business also delivered phenomenal growth on the top and bottom lines.\n\nIn its third quarter, revenue jumped 206% to $18.12 billion, and its net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) jumped more than thirteenfold to reach $9.24 billion, giving it a margin of more than 50%.\n\nHeading into 2024, Nvidia looks to be in great shape for even more growth. Its AI-focused H100 accelerators are in such high demand that prices for them have skyrocketed, and there's a shortage of its GPUs and other components used for its AI models.\n\nThe spoils of the AI boom are likely to spill over to other companies in 2024, and while Nvidia may retain its lead in AI chips, other chip stocks could narrow the gap. Here are three that could outperform the AI chip leader in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nIf any semiconductor company is going to pose a challenge to Nvidia in AI capabilities, it seems likely to be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nThe company's launch of its Instinct MI300 AI accelerators in December was highly anticipated, and the stock jumped 10% on the launch presentation, a sign Wall Street liked what it saw.\n\nAmong the customers for the new component are Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Oracle, among others. AMD also said the Instinct Platform can offer a throughput increase of 60% for running inference on large language models compared with the Nvidia H100 HGX.\n\nAMD also made a number of acquisitions in the AI space recently. It acquired AI software leader Mipsology and Nod.ai, an open-source AI software expert, which will help it accelerate its deployment of AI solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD stock was no slouch in 2023. The stock jumped 128%. But expectations in 2024 are still modest, with the consensus calling for 16% revenue growth. If its new products take off, AMD could easily top that forecast and the stock could soar.\n\n2. ACM Research\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ: ACMR) is a relative unknown in the semiconductor sector. The company doesn't make chips, but instead makes machines that clean semiconductor wafers, an important process to ensure that these tiny components don't make errors.\n\nThat position in the value chain makes ACM something of a picks-and-shovels play in the sector, but it also stands to benefit from the AI boom, since cleaning requirements are likely to become more technical as chips become more advanced and AI components become more in demand.\n\nACM Research is a small company, with a market cap of $1.2 billion, but its recent results are impressive. Revenue rose 26% to $21.3 million, with a 31% increase in shipments even during a cyclically challenging period in the semiconductor industry. On the bottom line, adjusted net income rose 33% to $37.5 million.\n\nACM is mostly focused on China, where it's considered a domestic supplier. That could give it an advantage at a time when a tech cold war between the U.S. and China is heating up, with the U.S. banning the export of some advanced technologies to China.\n\nThe stock is cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15, so it shouldn't take much to drive the stock higher in 2024, even after it gained 154% in 2023.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nFinally, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) also looks poised for a strong performance in 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry, handling roughly half of semiconductor manufacturing for companies including Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel.\n\nAI makes up about 6% of the company's revenue, but given the company's strong position in chip manufacturing and even larger market share in the manufacturing of advanced chips, it should see steady growth ahead from increasing AI demand.\n\nLike other semiconductor companies, TSMC is fast at work increasing capacity to handle demand for AI production. That momentum may already be starting to build, given that revenue in October jumped 16% from the year before.\n\nCompared with the chip designers, TSMC stock is also affordably priced, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20. With a broader recovery in the chip sector expected in 2024, TSMC could be a big winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Potentially Undervalued?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine NVIDIA’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nIs NVIDIA Still Cheap?\n\nNVIDIA appears to be overvalued by 35% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$495 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $367.26. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that NVIDIA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCan we expect growth from NVIDIA? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? NVDA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for NVIDIA and you'll want to know about this.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in NVIDIA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic in 2024",
        "content": "Following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the market by storm, helping send the S&P 500 Index up 25% year to date. Industry leaders such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have been key in helping power the rally because of their fast-growing chip businesses.\n\nLet's discuss why 2024 could be even more exciting for these two AI-related stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWith shares up a jaw-dropping 246% in 2023, Nvidia is arguably the biggest winner in 2023's AI gold rush. And unlike some other AI companies, its operating performance has surged to match the hype. It isn't too late for investors to bet on Nvidia's continued success because of its reasonable valuation and spectacular margins.\n\nNvidia's business is shifting from lower-value gaming hardware to high-performance AI chips. And that shift is transforming its operations.\n\nThird-quarter revenue increased by 206% year over year to a record of $18.12 billion, while net income surged by 1,259% to $9.2 billion. This is partially because of a dramatic rise in margin as the company sells more expensive data center chips like the H100, which can cost as much as $30,000 per unit.\n\nNvidia is also tackling other growth opportunities like China, where U.S. trade restrictions limit the import of some of its most advanced hardware. To comply with the rules, the company has launched slower versions of its Nvidia RTX4090 gaming chip, specifically for Chinese consumers. This move follows a November announcement of plans to develop AI chips customized for the Chinese market.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) growth rate of just 25, Nvidia stock is relatively cheap compared with its projected growth over the next 12 months. To put that number in context, the S&P 500 trades for an average of 26.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nWith Nvidia making boatloads of money from its data center chip business, its biggest rival, AMD, is vying for a piece of the opportunity through advanced AI hardware of its own. And while the chipmaker has yet to report significant gains from these efforts, investors can look forward to seeing the business scale up rapidly in 2024 and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to AMD's CEO Lisa Su, the market for AI-capable chips will surge tenfold to $400 billion by 2027. To take advantage of the opportunity, the company released the MI300 family of AI chips, which can outperform Nvidia's flagship H100 on key metrics like memory space and inference (running AI platforms).  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo far, AMD's new products have had no significant impact on the company's performance. Third-quarter revenue increased only 4% to $5.8 billion. However, analysts are optimistic that its new chips will see large-scale deployment in 2024, leading to significant revenue growth.\n\nAMD's valuation is nowhere near as good as Nvidia's, considering its significantly lower growth rate in the near term. In fact, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 39, its shares are more expensive than its larger rival. However, the situation could change as AMD's AI efforts start supercharging its operating performance.\n\nThere's room for two (or more)\n\nWhile Nvidia and AMD are about to enter direct competition in the market for the most advanced AI hardware, that doesn't mean one company has to lose for the other to win.\n\nAs mentioned, AMD's management believes the market for AI chips will surge more than tenfold to $400 billion. That figure is more than 20 times Nvidia's trailing 12-month revenue, leaving plenty of room for both companies to sell these products as fast as they can produce them, even if the market reaches only a fraction of those lofty estimates. Both stocks can continue their bull runs in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks the Smartest Investors Are Buying for 2024",
        "content": "The stock market has been unpredictable in recent years, with many companies enjoying immense growth in 2021 amid COVID-19 lockdowns only to lose all they had gained the following year after a macroeconomic-fueled sell-off in 2022. However, easing inflation and excitement over budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) seem to suggest the worst declines are over for now.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite surged 43% in 2023 and looks likely to continue trending up in the new year. Meanwhile, companies that have recently split their shares are attractive investment options, as the move is often followed by significant gains.\n\nSo, here are two stock-split stocks the smartest investors are buying for 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded in recent years, with its shares soaring more than 1,000% since 2018. Stellar growth led management to trigger a four-to-one stock split in July 2021, its fifth split since 2000. And the company appears to just be getting started.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Nvidia emerged as one of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, achieving an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it surpass a $1 trillion valuation before the decade's end.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia has gotten a head start on other chipmakers, supplying its hardware to most of the market. Increased demand for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) has seen the company's earnings soar. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended October 2023), Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206%, with operating income up more than 1,600% thanks to a spike in chip sales in its data center segment. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. That figure multiplied by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 40 yields a potential stock price of $960, projecting growth of 94% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a lucrative role in tech. Its hardware powers multiple sectors, from AI models to cloud platforms, video consoles, laptops, and more. Its solid long-term outlook makes it a stock-split stock too good to pass up for the new year.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has had four stock splits since its initial public offering in 1997, with its most recent one occurring in June 2022 in a 20-to-one split.\n\nThe company has enjoyed immense success over the years by leading two crucial sectors: e-commerce and cloud computing. Online retail on its own is expected to top $3 trillion in 2023 and expand at a CAGR of 10% until at least 2028. Meanwhile, Amazon dominates the industry in multiple countries.\n\nE-commerce hit some roadblocks during an economic downturn in 2022. However, Amazon's recent quarterly results indicate the industry has returned to growth. In Q3 2023, the company posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion.\n\nThe increase was primarily owed to an impressive turnaround in its North America segment, which posted more than $4 billion in operating income after suffering $412 million in losses in the year-ago period.\n\nIn addition to e-commerce, Amazon holds the largest market share in cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS), which it is using to carve out a promising position in AI. The tech giant is heavily investing in the technology, introducing a diverse range of AI tools on AWS over the last year and announcing a venture into chip development. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon has massive growth potential over the long term and is only made more attractive with its price-to-sales ratio of 2.8. The chart above shows the figure is the lowest among some of the most prominent names in tech, suggesting Amazon's stock offers the most value. And with that, the retail giant is a no-brainer investment for 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "You know what I hate about the typical article about hottest dividend stocks to watch? You’re excited about adding passive income to your portfolio, only to read about company after company that pays a dividend yield of 1%. Like, seriously – you would need a boatload of shares to see substance from such a lowly yield.\n\nRest assured, I’m not going to do you like that. Instead, every one of these dividend stocks to watch features a forward yield of at least 4% at time of writing. What’s more, the underlying fundamentals justify the generous payout. In other words, I’m not going the other extreme, feeding you a bunch of junk with unsustainable yields.\n\nSo, if you’ve already identified your growth plays and are seeking relevant, high-yielding enterprises, you’ve come to the right place.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nTo be quite blunt, legacy technology juggernaut IBM (NYSE:IBM) doesn’t get much love. It’s completely understandable. In the hip innovation sector, Big Blue comes off as the “okay boomer” play of the ecosystem. I mean, the company first originated in June of 1911. I dare say we don’t have too many folks walking among us that were around when IBM made its corporate debut.\n\nSet aside preconceived notions, though, and I think you’ll find that it’s one of the dividend stocks to watch. For one thing, IBM put up an intriguing performance. No, 15.5% up in 2023 is hardly impressive when the benchmark equities index is smoking you. But look at the second-half performance of 22.2% up; that’s better than – shock! – Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which gained only 17% during this period.\n\nNo, before you fire up an angry email, I’m not comparing the two. But here’s the thing. IBM has been doing artificial intelligence and machine learning for a long time. It deserves more respect than it’s getting. Of course, the forward yield of 4.06% is quite enticing. In my opinion, it’s easily one of the dividend stocks to watch.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) ABBV Stock: Offering Oil Yield Without Oil's Risk\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nA pharmaceutical giant, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offers a relevant platform for dividend stocks to watch. At a cynical level, no matter what happens in the economy, society will always have a need for advanced therapeutics. Therefore, I view the red ink in ABBV – it lost almost 5% in 2023 – as a contrarian opportunity. Indeed, in the past six months, shares gained 15%, suggesting a possible comeback in 2024.\n\nBut I’m more looking forward to 2025 and many, many years beyond that. Earlier, AbbVie acquired Allergan and in doing so, it took over the Botox neurotoxic protein. As you know, people undergo Botox injections for anti-wrinkle solutions. But here’s something I didn’t know. Many folks also use Botox as a preventative treatment; that is, it may be better to start treatment at a younger age to extend a youthful appearance.\n\nI believe that’s a huge catalyst for ABBV considering that millennials and Generation Z – the social-media-obsessed cohorts – are intensely focused on their physical appearance. It’s cynical but that makes AbbVie’s forward dividend yield of 4% all the more credible. I’m a fan.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nEasily the most controversial idea for dividend stocks to watch on this list, if you’re ideologically agnostic, then Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) deserves a long look. At first glance, the tobacco giant seems completely anachronistic. Let’s face it. In many parts of the world, government agencies have cracked down on public areas where smoking was previously allowed. Sports organizations have heavily discouraged tobacco advertising.\n\nSo, is that the gallows for the tobacco stalwart? Hardly. While “analog” smoking may be fading away in several western nations, “digital” smoking is on the rise. According to Grand View Research, the global e-cigarette and vape market size reached a valuation of $22.45 billion in 2022. Further, this sector may expand at a blistering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.6% to 2030. At the forecast culmination point, the market could post revenue of $182.84 billion.\n\nYou know what’s really off the charts? Government agencies worldwide may eventually ban flavored e-cigarettes, which is the domain of small business. Big tobacco, on the other hand, may find exemptions with non-flavored tobacco-centric e-cigs. Cynical, yes, but that’s why Philip Morris’ forward yield of 5.53% is so enticing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Megatrend Stocks to Buy for a Mighty Start to 2024",
        "content": "2024 promises to be a lucrative year in the stock market for many reasons. First of all, the Federal Reserve is on track to begin easing off in its efforts to cool an overheated economy. Interest rates are set to decrease with multiple projected cuts on the horizon.\n\nBeyond that though, the world continues to evolve at a rapid pace with multiple megatrends promising to galvanize strong growth. Perhaps none is more salient and influential than artificial intelligence. However there are many other trends to consider including sustainability, mobility, demographics, geopolitics and more. The biggest trends, the so-called megatrends, are particularly worth paying attention to.\n\nJoby Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA recent article in Forbes demonstrates why investors should be inherently interested in Joby Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) and its stock. The article paints a picture of an airline passenger who has just disembarked from a Hypersonic flight taking 2 hours from New York to London. That passenger then jumps into an urban air mobility drone, avoiding rush hour traffic, and arrives home in 20 minutes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUrban air mobility has emerged as one of the megatrends to pay attention to in 2023. Firms including Joby Aviation are developing electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) at a rapid pace. These firms have established strong relationships with airline companies, Joby with Delta (NYSE:DAL), that promise to revolutionize commercial flight.\n\nThe company undertook exhibition flights in New York City in November. The company expects to drastically decrease the time required to and from major airports in the area. For example, it anticipates that a flight to JFK from the surrounding boroughs will decline from 1 hour to 7 minutes. Joby Aviation continues to demonstrate the volume potential of its operations at airports. Joby recently demonstrated that it would be possible to operate 120 flights per hour in and out of busy airports.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Is another stock to consider that leverages the drastic changes occurring across the field of mobility. Electric vehicles continue to displace internal combustion engine vehicles although their growth has not been linear. I am, of course, referring to the recent collapse in lithium prices and EV sales.\n\nIn short, the electrification of vehicles is not going to stop. EV adoption is still relatively early overall but investors should rest assured the industry is not dying. Lithium did however face a steep price correction in 2023 that saw prices decline by 80%. However with every decline there is always a chance of rebound. Current expectations are that the rebound in lithium prices will begin either in 2024 or perhaps 2025.\n\nThat coincides quite well with Lithium Americas and its future production plans. The company owns the rights to Thacker Pass which is the largest lithium deposit in the Western hemisphere. Lithium Americas commenced construction in June of this year and anticipates lithium mining operations to start sometime in 2026. It isn’t hyperbolic to suggest that investing in Lithium Americas could produce 10x returns.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could pop up on any megatrend stock list for a number of reasons. The company is intimately connected with all things technological being that it is the leading producer of the most in-demand chips. Primarily though, Nvidia promises to provide a strong start to 2024 because of artificial intelligence.\n\nOf course, artificial intelligence is a megatrend that has taken off in 2023. Its rapid emergence has turned Nvidia into an even more important company. As strong as Nvidia’s performance has been in 2023, 2024 appears to be just as strong. The analysts covering Nvidia’s shares anticipate that prices could rise by 50% again, if not more.\n\nNvidia has cornered the market for AI chips and demand for its h100 chips has been staggering. That said, the company is expected to launch its updated h200 chips in 2024 that promise to further consolidate its lead over the AI field.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has to be the other stock to consider in relation to the artificial intelligence megatrend. While the company continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia, it has emerged as a legitimate competitor.\n\nBack in mid-November the company announced an event to introduce its MI300 GPU accelerator. Then, weeks later, in early December the company released the new chips which will be available in 2024. The news has sent AMD shares from just below $100 to nearly $150 as I write this.\n\nIt has become clear that major companies are very interested in AMD’s chips for their application to artificial intelligence. Major purchasers including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have noted that they are willing to switch from Nvidia’s h100 chips to AMD’s mi300 chips once they are available. The news is a clear indication that major tech firms believe in AMD and are also frustrated with Nvidia for its pricing. Overall though, it’s a strong indication that AMD is going to remain as a potent challenger in the AI conversation.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another important tech company that touches on many of the megatrends of the near future. The stock is a wise choice for many reasons including its stability and dividend as well as its relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nFor the purposes of this conversation though, I’ll be talking about Qualcomm in relation to its 5G business. 5G is one of the mega trends that has emerged over the past few years. It promises to rapidly increase the speed of communication and the degree of connectivity. The push toward greater and greater connectivity is not going to slow and it is estimated that $20,000 satellites will be launched this decade in order to facilitate that increased connectivity.\n\nQualcomm notes that 5G is imperative for the Continue development of the digital economy. In fact, the company believes that the overall value associated with 5G will exceed $13 trillion by 2035.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) Has emerged as the company that is most closely associated with the development of quantum computing. Quantum computing is a nascent technology that promises to fundamentally change computing overall. The field leverages quantum mechanics to solve problems that are too complex for current classical computers to solve.\n\nQuantum computing is an incredibly complex field and those who would like to learn more about it should do so through this link.\n\nThe important thing to understand for the layman investor like myself is that IBM is the leader in quantum computing. Thus, if any company is best positioned to take advantage of this megatrend, IBM is it.\n\nIBM’s industry-best qubit count is expected to more than quadruple by 2025. The company is developing quantum computing hardware as well as software including the cloud-based quantum computing services. If quantum computing lives up to its billing then IBM can grow rapidly. For now, current investors can get a dividend that yields more than 4% making IBM shares attractive for income investors and those looking for future growth.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) often enters discussions that relate to e-commerce and fintech stocks. It’s probably the clearest example of a company that is showing strong results in both regards. The company has emerged as the dominant force in Latin American e-commerce and created a strong, rapidly growing payments platform in the process.\n\nMercadoLibre’s results in that regard are incredibly impressive. During the third quarter, revenues increased by more than 69%, reaching $3.8 billion. Meanwhile, gross payment volume grew by 121% to $47.3 billion. And while Mercado Libre deserves recognition for those results, there are other megatrends that I want to focus on.\n\nInstead, it is the megatrend of emerging markets. Economists continue to note that emerging markets have vast untapped potential. World superpowers including the United States and China face significant problems which has led investors to look at emerging markets with a greater focus. Thus, firms like MercadoLibre are well positioned due to their exposure to the emerging market trend as well as those in fintech and commerce.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Hot Semiconductor Stock Trends to Watch for 2024",
        "content": "Expect big things for 2024 as global semiconductor trends accelerate. Analysts forecast that, broadly, 2024 will mark a record year for revenue while the industry prepares to double within the next decade, generating a trillion dollars in revenue between now and then.\n\nThat means, of course, that you don’t have to be the Warren Buffett of semiconductor stocks to ride the wave upward. If you find reliable, well-known, stable semiconductor stocks and hold them for the long haul, you’ll likely do just fine. But there are hundreds of hidden semiconductor stocks out there. If you can effectively forecast some of the less-recognized trends and then pin down the best stocks in the sector to capitalize on the trend, you could easily outperform the broader sector.\n\nRecovery and Rebound in 2024\n\nThough semiconductors remained top-of-mind for many investors, the sector itself struggled this year. Widespread demand for the most advanced semiconductors isn’t there yet, while middle-market products aren’t sufficiently profitable to drive solid margins. Expect 2023 to mark a sector-wide 12% sales decline once the dust settles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut winds could be shifting. On the heels of slackened demand, many companies cut production and exhausted existing inventory. That series of strategies seems as though it’ll cause a bullwhip effect as increased demand outpaces inventory and production capability.\n\nAnalysts expect that continued AI developments and renewed consumer confidence leading to more tech purchasing will spark a 20% annual growth rate in 2024. Ultimately, that will benefit semiconductor stocks globally, so investing in a solid manufacturer with this in mind could prove profitable, even if you don’t have the expertise to truly pick the best-in-class semiconductor stock.\n\nStock to watch:Onto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO), which offers testing and quality control solutions for semiconductor stocks – meaning it benefits no matter which company comes out on top.\n\nStory continues\n\nDriver Assistance and Infotainment\n\nThough not the largest semiconductor market segment (edged out by data processing, of course), the automotive sector’s semiconductor demand is growing the fastest. That segment is set to hit 10.3% CAGR by 2025. And, within the rapidly growing segment, driver assistance, safety and infotainment systems are the most chip-hungry subcomponents.\n\nSemiconductors power most vehicular functions today, but increased vehicle “smartness” across legacy and electric segments demands greater semiconductor sourcing. Anti-lock brake systems, airbag management, air conditioning and more all rely on semiconductors like never before. That’s part of what drove the record used car sales throughout the pandemic. New manufacturers, reliant on semiconductors, got hamstrung by global supply chain slowdowns and drove astronomic used car pricing. And that’s without addressing self-driving vehicles. Those systems have a suite of safety features and detection systems that — you guessed it — need a slew of semiconductors.\n\nBut semiconductors benefit even the most basic makes and models, as advances in dashboard infotainment (think CarPlay) are prevalent in even economy models. Infotainment expansion could hit 38% growth through 2023, making it a top semiconductor trend to watch.\n\nStock to watch: Infineon (OTCMKTS:IFNNY), which specializes in EV and infotainment semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nAI in Your Pocket\n\nAI runs on massive amounts of data processing demands, which rely on massive data centers driven by semiconductors. But just as the earliest computers took up entire university halls before shrinking to pocket size, advanced AI applications will shrink to accommodate smaller and more efficient hardware.\n\nMost of that push towards personal AI will be driven by advances in semiconductors and similar tech more than coding or software. The best AI assistant is useless if the hardware won’t support its mobility and lifestyle integration, so stocks pushing to make better chips smaller will be at the forefront of personal AI. Just like today’s mega-stocks were at the fore of personal computing trends, companies able to adapt hardware to suit personal AI applications will be tomorrow’s Magnificent 7 — or bigger.\n\nAt the same time, there is an increased preference for even “dumb(ish)” wearables and fitness tracking tech. These, too, need shrunken semiconductors to effectively integrate wearables with peripheral tech like phones and monitoring systems.\n\nStock to watch: Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), whose partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) puts it at the leading edge of pocket-sized semiconductor applications.\n\nSustainability\n\nThere’s no doubt that, like many emergent tech trends, semiconductor development isn’t environmentally friendly. Semiconductor production demands energy and water in spades while offloading significant greenhouse gasses. A growing environmental impact, alongside indications that tech is hurting the environment through energy usage more than it’s helping through innovation, is kickstarting calls for transparency and climate action within semiconductor companies.\n\nLooking ahead, 2024 and beyond will likely mark a turning point where more semiconductor companies embrace comprehensive sustainability strategies to keep regulatory bodies and consumers happy. But shifting towards sustainability makes business sense, too. Implementing water recycling and renewable energy use helps address direct and supply chain emissions and leads to reduced operating costs. This dual benefit of environmental responsibility and improved financial positioning makes sustainability another top semiconductor trend.\n\nStock to watch: ASM International (OTCMKTS:ASMIY), a Dutch firm recognized as the first semiconductor stock to validate a net-zero path.\n\nMegaplant and Foundry Industry Expansion\n\nAs countries realize the advantage of geographically centralized manufacturing when supply chains slow, expect greater demand for in-house semiconductor plants and foundry development. Though little has come to fruition yet, we’re already seeing the US CHIPS and Science Act push toward semiconductor independence at home.\n\nAt the same time, Japan acts as a model of what prudent positioning looks like. The country is allocating $10 billion toward semiconductor projects, including a second massive Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSMC) plant. At the same time, Japan ensures that TSMC’s expert teams educate internal scientists and researchers to diversify its knowledge base. That’s evident from the collaboration between TSMC and Japan’s own private semiconductor company, Rapidus Corp.\n\nUltimately, Japan stands as a model for national semiconductor industrial expansion by ensuring facility growth remains matched with growing the knowledge base and national brainpower. Hopefully, the US CHIPS Act’s lofty promises will come to fruition, and we, too, can stake a future on independent semiconductor development.\n\nStock to watch: Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSMC).\n\nChina Fights for Dominance\n\nOf course, a major geopolitical sticking point within the semiconductor industry is China. Not only does tension put pressure on the Taiwanese top semiconductor stock, TSMC, but the nation is offering cut-rate price competition in a bid to squeeze other national competitors from the market. Most of that price push comes amid US sanctions that prevent sales to major Western powers, forcing China to make ends meet where it can.\n\nBut, internally, China’s 5G proliferation and Huawei expansion mean the country is increasingly competitive as market forces push for greater innovation. Sanctions mean China’s AI capabilities lag ours as they’re cut off from business with the most advanced manufacturer, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Still, internal advancements continue unabated, and it might be a matter of time until China is as competitive as Nvidia on the national front — especially if they squeeze out competition through cost leadership plays.\n\nTech Talent\n\nTalent management remains top-of-mind within the industry, making companies able to snag the best performers more competitive than their peers. Expect semiconductor companies to dip into global markets more often as at-home talent becomes exhausted. This, of course, presents a double-edged sword. While snagging top talent improves operational outcomes, it comes at a cost — both in compensation and continued training — so fierce competition for a shrinking talent pool could just as likely cause share price troubles.\n\nExpect to see top semiconductor stocks start fostering community development to nurture future talent pools. That could include sponsoring STEM competitions or offering scholarships to talented students. In any case, competition is fierce within the semiconductor sector, and talent acquisition isn’t an exception.\n\nStock to watch: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because name recognition and the top-performing semiconductor spot both go a long way toward attracting top talent.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Ignore the Skeptics. Buy C3.ai Stock for Long-Term Gains in 2024.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks had an excellent year in the markets. While C3.ai (NYSE:AI) stock didn’t quite match the performance of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), up 247% through Dec. 28, it did manage to deliver a 176% return for its shareholders in 2023.\n\nThere’s no question that AI was one of the top investment stories of 2023. Undoubtedly, this technology will remain a key focus of Wall Street in 2024. Consider that 14 analysts currently cover AI stock. I’d be shocked if that total didn’t reach 20 or more in the year ahead.\n\nWhile analysts aren’t sold on C3.ai stock, I could see it delivering a second consecutive year with triple-digit returns in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat does it have to do to achieve this target?\n\nFor starters, the S&P 500 needs another 20%+ return in 2024. Even more critical, the Nasdaq 100, set to deliver its best annual return since 1999, must keep increasing. Any reversal from the tech-heavy index (49.83% of the index holdings) will kiss the AI company’s hopes for a repeat performance goodbye.\n\nSo, here are three things to focus on with C3.ai as we head into a new year.\n\nA Few More Upgrades Would Help\n\nAs I said, 14 analysts are covering AI stock right now. Just three rate it Overweight or Buy, with seven at Hold, one at Underweight, and three at an outright Sell. By comparison, 94% of the 52 analysts covering NVDA stock rate it Overweight or Buy.\n\nThat’s a massive gap in respect.\n\nThe last upgrade of C3.ai came on November 21 when Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan raised his rating on the stock from Perform to Outperform, the equivalent of moving from Hold to Buy.\n\n“We think they are set to outperform as evidence accumulates that AI can lead to both major new revenue sources and productivity improvements,” Barron’s reported Horan’s November comments from a research note to clients.\n\nEven better, Horan set a price target of $40, 32% higher than where it’s currently trading. There’s no question that the analyst likes C3.ai’s chances in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it could use more help, say by the three bearish analysts becoming bullish about its stock or some new analysts initiating coverage with a Buy rating and a $40+ price target.\n\nUltimately, it needs more than three Buy ratings to complete the job in 2024.\n\nForget Profits … for Now\n\nBy investing heavily in generative AI, CEO Tom Siebel he admitted in September that non-GAAP profitability is off the table for now.\n\n“The market opportunity is immediate, and we intend to seize it. While we still expect to be cash positive in Q4 FY 24 and in FY 25, we will be investing in our Generative AI solutions and at this time do not expect to be non-GAAP profitable in Q4 FY 24,” Siebel stated in its Q1 2024 press release.\n\nOn Dec. 6, it released its Q2 2024 results. The CEO pointed out that its year-over-year revenue growth was 17%. That’s up from 11% growth in Q1 2024, 0% in Q4 2023, and -4% in Q3 2023. As expected, it had a non-GAAP operating loss of $25.0 million in the second quarter, up from $15.0 million a year earlier.\n\nFor 2024, it expects revenue of $295 million to $320 million, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $125 million at the midpoint of its guidance. With over $750 million cash on the balance sheet, it has plenty to fuel its top-line growth over the next 18-24 months.\n\nIn September, the company said it had closed 12 generative AI agreements with more than 140 qualified leads for more. In December, it closed 20 generative AI agreements in the second quarter, with 225 qualified leads, considerably more than in the previous quarter.\n\nSimilarly, C3.ai’s growth continues to be scoffed at by some on Wall Street, just as it had done with Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) until its shares took off at the end of 2022. Like C3.ai, analysts are lukewarm about Palantir.\n\nContrarian investors will ignore the naysayers and buy C3.ai stock for long-term gains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Investors Bought This Hyper-Growth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Hand Over Fist in 2023. Will It Split Its Shares in 2024?",
        "content": "It would be difficult to not mention Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) when recapping the stock market's 2023. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and Nvidia's triple-digit surge are arguably among 2023's leading headlines.\n\nBy the end of December, Nvidia had rocketed to roughly $500 per share, a steep price for many investors who want to buy whole shares.\n\nWill the stock split in 2024 and bring down the price of a full share? Should that affect whether investors should continue buying shares?\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nWhy Nvidia stock could split\n\nPredicting a stock split isn't rocket science, and some clues point to it happening soon with Nvidia. The company has a history of splitting its stock, which is when a company multiplies or divides its share count without changing overall market capitalization. So, if the number of shares goes up, the value per share goes down.\n\nNvidia's most recent split came in 2021. Shares were trading at $744 before the split. Nvidia isn't yet at such a high share price, but it's getting within shouting distance at $500.\n\nBefore 2021, Nvidia split its stock four other times between 2000 and 2007. Shares rose 334% over those seven years. I think management likes to keep the share price palatable for most investors.\n\nThe rapid growth of AI in 2023 has also established a growth narrative around Nvidia that could stretch well into the future. In other words, Nvidia's fundamentals seem destined to carry the stock higher over the coming years, and that makes me think a Nvidia stock split is a matter of when and not if.\n\nBut here's the secret about stock splits\n\nInvestors must understand what stock splits do and don't do. Splits reduce the trading price of a share of stock. This makes it cheaper to own a piece of that business, but a split doesn't fundamentally affect a stock's value. It creates a lower share price by splitting the stock into more pieces (shares).\n\nFor example, suppose you want some pie. You go to the store and see a pie worth $40 selling as two halves for $20 each. You don't want to pay $20 for pie, so you ask the store to cut the halves to divide the pie into four quarters selling for $10 each. In that case, you're paying $10 for pie but getting a smaller piece.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock splits work the same way. The company is worth the same, but investors are paying a smaller share price for a smaller piece of the business the stock represents. That's not necessarily bad, but remember that stock splits don't change fundamental value, only the share price. Investors who can't afford a full share could also check out buying fractional shares.\n\nShould investors buy Nvidia for 2024 and beyond?\n\nInvestors should buy Nvidia if they like where it's business is going, not because of anything management does with share count. The good news is that Nvidia looks like a great long-term buy. It is the overwhelming market leader in AI chips, which are being put in massive data centers to process intense computing workloads.\n\nRevenue in the company's most recent quarter was up 200% from the year-ago quarter. Analysts are predicting long-term earnings growth averaging 42% annually. Despite its massive run in 2023, the stock trades at a forward P/E of just 40. The resulting price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 1 signals that the stock is a bargain, assuming long-term growth estimates materialize. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNo stock is risk-free. Competition will surely come for Nvidia and hitting growth estimates isn't a sure thing. But if investors intend to hold for the long term, they should be rewarded.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The Magnificent Seven stocks have dominated the stock market this year, driving the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index's over 43% year-to-date gains.\n\nThe large-cap tech stocks mainly banked on the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector and the growing popularity of the metaverse. AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock this year, gaining over 234% year to date. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is close behind with over 193% gains over the same period.\n\nWith immense upside over the past year, many experts speculate the tech behemoths have peaked. With recession fears looming for 2024, diversifying outside of big tech can hedge investors' portfolios in the event of a market downturn.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.\n\nAs of Dec. 4, the recession probability model from the New York Federal Reserve indicates a 51.8% likelihood of a U.S. recession occurring within the next 12 months.\n\nIrrespective of the concerning market backdrop, analysts are bullish on these large-cap stocks in the near term.\n\nSpotify\n\nUp over 140% year-to-date, Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) is one of the biggest music streaming companies in the world.\n\nSpotify enjoys strong financials, as its total monthly active users increased 26% year over year to 574 million in the fiscal third quarter ended Sept. 30. The company's revenue increased 11% year over year to €3.36 billion ($3.7 billion). Operating income came in at €32 million, compared to a loss of €228 million reported in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company slashed its workforce by 17% earlier this month, which is expected to reduce its operating expenses by roughly 2% in fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business — one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future,\" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said. \"While we've made worthy strides, as I've shared many times, we still have work to do. Economic growth has slowed dramatically, and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities.\"\n\nAnalysts expect Spotify's revenue to rise by 17.3% year over year to $17.21 billion in fiscal 2024. In addition, Wall Street predicts Spotify's earnings per share (EPS) to be $2.05 next year.\n\nPivotal Research recently upgraded its rating on Spotify stock from Hold to Buy, with a price target of $265, indicating a potential upside of over 39%. Rosenblatt Securities also upgraded its outlook on Spotify to Buy, with a price target of $300, which reflects a price target of over 58%.\n\nAnheuser-Busch\n\nAnheuser-Busch Inbev SA (NYSE:BUD) was caught up in a major controversy earlier this year when transgender publicist Dylan Mulvaney promoted Bud Light beer through her Instagram account, angering conservative consumers. Anheuser-Busch, the largest beer manufacturer in the U.S., reported a sharp decline in sales in the third quarter as the controversy intensified amid a nationwide boycott from conservatives.\n\nThe company has taken steps to improve its consumer rankings by rebranding its packages.\n\n\"We recognize that over the last two months, the discussion surrounding our company and Bud Light has moved away from beer, and this has impacted our consumers, our business partners and our employees,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are a beer company, and beer is for everyone.\"\n\nAnheuser-Busch shares have recovered, rising by over 14% over the past three months. JPMorgan expects this momentum to continue, as the financial institution has an Overweight rating on Anheuser-Busch stock with a price target of $79, reflecting a 22.5% potential upside.\n\nRestaurant Brands International\n\nRestaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) is one of the largest restaurant companies in the world, with 2022 sales of about $39 billion at nearly 30,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.\n\nThe company manages popular beverage and fast food chains such as Tim Hortons, Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. As the holiday sales kick in, Restaurant Brands' revenue is expected to rise 7.1% year over year in the quarter that ends in December.\n\nRBC Capital has an Outperform on Restaurant Brands stock with a price target of $87, indicating a potential upside of nearly 12.4% from the current price. BMO also has an Outperform rating on Restaurant Brands with a price target of $85, indicating a potential upside of over 9% from the current price.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been the stars of 2023. Collectively, they account for almost two-thirds of the S&P 500's total return over the last year.\n\nBut, the real question is, will the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, MetaPlatforms, and Tesla -- lead the market again in 2024? Or could other stocks lead the way in the new year?\n\nI think the latter is more likely. Here are the stocks -- which I'd call the \"Fab Four\" -- I have my eye on: Image source: Getty Images.\n\nVisa\n\nTopping this list is Visa (NYSE: V).\n\nLet me be clear: Visa is not the most exciting stock around. The company has been around for decades; it's not in the headlines every day. Its business model is simple, bordering on dull.\n\nBut oh boy, has that business model delivered.\n\nOver the 15 years since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2008, Visa shares have recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21%. That means $10,000 invested in Visa shares at its IPO would now be worth over $204,000. V Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nBehind that monster performance is a beautiful business model -- charging fees in exchange for facilitating payments on Visa's gigantic payments network. For fiscal year 2023 (the 12 months ending on Sept. 30), Visa processed 212 billion transactions, with a total payment volume of over $12 trillion. From that, the company generated $32.7 billion in revenue and $17.3 billion in net income.\n\nWhat's more, the company then rewarded shareholders with $16.1 billion in share repurchases and dividend payments. That's a recipe every investor should love, and I think it will continue to pay off for Visa and its shareholders in 2024.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe smallest company by market cap on my list, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), is nevertheless a stock that every investor should know. That's because the company is one of the leading cybersecurity providers around.\n\nCrowdStrike provides AI-enabled security modules that protect its clients' networks, data, and endpoints. This has become all the more important today as the number of cyberattacks has skyrocketed.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, in 2023 alone, organizations ranging from hospitals and schools to casinos and retailers have all been hacked. In some cases, hackers demanded ransoms to return sensitive data or to reactivate critical operations.\n\nThis enormous increase in cybercrime means that demand for CrowdStrike's products is bursting at the seams.\n\nAs of its most recent quarter (the three months ending Oct. 31), the company reported revenue growth of 35%. Moreover, CrowdStrike's subscription-based model is attractive and scalable. Over the last nine months, 94% of the company's revenue has come from subscriptions. In addition, 63% of CrowdStrike's customers use five or more of the company's security modules.\n\nThanks to its red-hot growth and scalable technology, I think CrowdStrike is a name to watch in 2024.\n\nShopify\n\nNext up is Shopify (NYSE: SHOP). The company, which operates one of the world's fastest-growing e-commerce platforms, is poised for a big 2024.\n\nLike many high-octane growth stocks, Shopify shares suffered a setback in 2022, as interest rates screamed higher and the stock market slumped.\n\nHowever, that temporary setback lit a fire. Management has cut costs in each of the last two years, starting with staff reductions of 10% in 2022 and 20% in 2023.\n\nAs a result, Shopify's free cash flow has rebounded. It stands at $548 million as of the company's most recent third quarter.\n\nYet despite the cost reductions, Shopify is still growing. Revenue growth has averaged 43% over the last three years, as total revenue has surged from $2.9 billion in 2020 to $6.7 billion today. SHOP Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\n\nMore to the point, Shopify is becoming the go-to e-commerce platform for influencers and up-and-coming brands. For example, Shopify has partnered with Crate & Barrel, Allbirds, and Blendjet to build online storefronts, increase conversion rates, and supercharge sales.\n\nAs we enter 2024, Shopify has all the hallmarks of a stock on the rise.\n\nNvidia\n\nFinally, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) rounds out the Fabulous Four.\n\nGranted, Nvidia is a well-known member of the Magnificent Seven. However, I view Nvidia as a cut above the rest. That's because Nvidia is riding an unprecedented tidal wave of demand.\n\nSimply put, the AI revolution is changing the way business is done. Consider these examples:\n\nAmazon now has over 750,000 robots working in its vast fulfillment warehouses. Generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Adobe's Firefly, and Alphabet's AlphaCode are reshaping text, image, and source code composition. AI learning tools, like those used by Duolingo, are reshaping how students learn.\n\nTo put it another way, AI is taking over. Not in Terminator-like fashion, more like the way the internet started reshaping the world 30 years ago. Organizations are now rushing to scale up their AI tools to stay ahead of -- or at least even with -- the competition.\n\nAs a result, demand for Nvidia's top AI chips is through the roof. Similarly, Nvidia's revenue and earnings are skyrocketing, and analysts are scrambling to raise next year's estimates. Over the last 90 days, the consensus estimate for Nvidia's 2025 earnings per share (EPS) has jumped from $16.71 to $20.50 -- an increase of 23%.\n\nIn summary, 2024 could be another stellar year for Nvidia, perhaps even more so than 2023.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "2024’s Power Players: 7 Stocks Racing to a Trillion Valuation",
        "content": "As it stands now, six U.S.-listed stocks are in the “trillion dollar club,” or stocks with a market cap of at least $1 trillion. In the coming year, or in the years ahead, which other mega-cap stocks (stocks with a market cap of $200 billion or more) will join them and become the next trillion-dollar companies?\n\nThat’s a question on the minds of many investors. Technological breakthroughs in areas like artificial intelligence and electric vehicles point to several companies “joining the club.”\n\nSo, too, do breakthroughs/long-term trends in other areas, like healthcare and financial services. There are also mega-cap companies that, while growing at only a moderate pace, are within reach of hitting the trillion-dollar mark within this decade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, let’s take a look at seven companies that appear most likely to become trillion-dollar stocks and when exactly each of them can reach this milestone.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) What to Expect From AMD Stock Ahead of July's Earnings Report\n\nSource: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to the next chip stock to join Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the trillion dollar club, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a name that to many may first come to mind. Yet, while the chip designer is currently making its own big moves in AI chips, reaching a $1 trillion market cap may be easier said than done.\n\nAMD stock currently has a market cap of around $236 billion. Hence, shares need to surge more than fourfold to join the trillion-dollar club. With AMD rising eightfold over the past five years, quadrupling in price should be a cinch, right?\n\nNot necessarily. Due to this year’s ‘AI mania,’ AMD’s AI catalyst appears to be priced in and then some. Unless the company’s AI endeavors result in earnings many times that of current estimates, even reaching trillion-dollar status by 2030 may be, at best, a stretch.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD may not be on the fast track to becoming one of the next trillion-dollar companies, but another semiconductor firm might be. It is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Why? AVGO is already more than halfway there, with a market cap of $527.2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, as argued previously, AVGO stock may have a far greater runway than other top AI stocks. Valuation is a big reason for this. AVGO trades at a forward multiple in the low 20s. “Magnificent Seven” AI stocks trade for 30-40 times forward earnings.\n\nAlso, Broadcom could eke out billions in cost/growth synergies from its recent VMware merger, enabling the company to beat current earnings growth expectations. To reach a $1 trillion market cap, all AVGO needs to do is rise in value by just under 90%. A mix of multiple expansion and earnings growth could get it there sooner than you think.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) logo, stock trade and chart on smartphone. Business and finance market.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), legendary investor Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle, is even closer than AVGO to reaching the trillion-dollar threshold. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate currently has a market cap of $777.9 billion.\n\nThis means all BRK.A/BRK.B stock needs to do is rise by 28.5% to achieve this valuation goal. Given the mostly “old economy” nature of Berkshire and its various businesses/holdings, not to mention its huge size, you may think that reaching a trillion is, at best, several years away for the company.\n\nHowever, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, the “road to $1 trillion” may not be as long as it seems. Per the commentator, even if growth among Berkshire’s businesses screeched to a halt, adding these stagnant cash flows to the company’s war chest would still justify a move to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nAdmittedly, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) may be the most questionable candidate to become one of the next trillion-dollar companies. Shares in the big pharma firm have surged to a valuation of $522.4 billion thanks to the massive potential of its drug candidate, Zepbound.\n\nWhile initially developed as a treatment for diabetes under the Mounjaro name, Eli Lilly has been working to get Zepbound approved as an obesity treatment. Given Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) success with its Ozempic/Wegovy obesity treatment, it’s no surprise that Wall Street is very bullish on LLY stock.\n\nYet while further positive news regarding Mounjaro/Zepbound may lead to further gains for LLY, with shares trading for 88.4 times earnings, one can argue that the future growth potential of this and other obesity treatments is already priced into the stock. Hence, you may want to tread carefully with this trillion-dollar contender.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The META backed Threads app as a compelling alternative to Twitter. Social media application technology concept.\n\nSource: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a market cap of $919.7 billion, it may be a matter of months, not years, before Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) becomes one of the next trillion-dollar stocks. In fact, as I argued recently, shares in the Facebook and Instagram parent could climb to a value well above $1 trillion during 2024.\n\nPut simply, a combination of earnings growth, further progress with the company’s AI efforts, plus greater appreciation of Meta’s AI bona fides could result in META stock (at around $360 per share today) rallying to $500 or $600 per share.\n\nIn other words, it’s within the realm of possibility that Meta Platforms will become a $1.5 trillion (by market cap) company within a year. That’s a valuation that would put Meta’s valuation in the same ballpark as other trillion-dollar club members like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt may be strange to say that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the next trillion-dollar companies. Mainly because the EV industry leader was, at one point, a trillion-dollar company. In October 2021, just before the 2021-2022 stock market downturn, TSLA attained a market cap exceeding $1 trillion.\n\nThe stock experienced a massive drawdown from late 2021 through January 2023. Following this, a massive rebound throughout 2023. As a result, TSLA stock is back to a market cap of around $804.8 billion. All that’s necessary to send Tesla back to trillion-dollar status is a 24.25% move higher.\n\nEven as Tesla skeptics point to issues like the EV sales slowdown as signs that TSLA will slide lower in 2024, as I pointed out last week, a potential catalyst could supercharge shares later in the year: the debut of a low-priced, mass-market Tesla EV model.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is another mega-cap that’s halfway towards the trillion-dollar market cap mark. Shares in payment technology companies have produced outsized long-term returns for investors since the stock’s debut in the late 2000s.\n\nFollowing an incredible run from a split-adjusted $15-$20 per share in early 2008 to around $260 per share today, some may expect V stock to produce more modest returns from here. However, the move from cash-based to card/digital-based transactions continues. This company also continues to benefit from having a deep economic moat. It is not far-fetched to think that Visa could continue reporting double-digit annual earnings growth in the years to come.\n\nIn short, Visa is one of the “it’s a matter of when, not if” trillion-dollar contenders. With this, plus the stock’s reasonable valuation (26.3 times earnings) compared to growth forecasts, consider making it a long-term buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Investing Preview 2024: Buy These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Avoid the Others.",
        "content": "Any investing exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks has made your 2023 investing year a big success. This group of mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), has outperformed the broader market despite the Nasdaq Composite surging over 45% last year.\n\nIf it's not broken, don't fix it... right? Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023.\n\n1. Nvidia: Buy\n\nNvidia's chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That's pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAI demand doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia's valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That's a PEG ratio of just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023.\n\n2. Apple: Avoid\n\nNot every \"Magnificent Seven\" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple's revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple's business can be cyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That's fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAnalysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta Platforms: Buy\n\nWall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business, harmful privacy changes to iPhones, and expensive metaverse projects that weren't showing any return on investment. Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs, working through the iPhone challenges, and getting revenue growth and profits back on track. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAstonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta is still a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond.\n\n4. Microsoft: Avoid\n\nChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world's largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it's becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillion market cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock's resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn't as appealing as some other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nIt's not abhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop, there are better deals out there. It's OK for investors to be picky.\n\n5. Amazon: Buy\n\nInterestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the past decade, that's over 20% below Amazon's average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing in developing its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That's not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail).\n\n6. Tesla: Avoid\n\nElectric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It's a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla's operating results. Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year. TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it's striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla's future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla's stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy.\n\n7. Alphabet: Buy\n\nAlphabet's dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world's most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock's 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks dominated the market in 2023. The worst performer in the group, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), rose 49%, and the best, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), jumped nearly 240%. But with such strong runs behind them, do any of them have room left to grow in 2024?\n\nThe answer: Yes, and some are still worth buying at their current prices.\n\nApple and Nvidia are both richly valued for their performance\n\nI'm breaking the seven up into buy, sell, and hold groups. Starting with the sell set, I think Apple and Nvidia's stock prices far outpaced their businesses.\n\nNvidia's 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, and its business has responded in kind. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), revenue rose 206% year over year. Furthermore, management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue, up 231%. The stock's movement was warranted given the company's sales growth, but I'm concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\n\nNvidia goes through boom and bust cycles, and right now is certainly a boom. However, it's unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term. If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly, the stock may come crashing back down to earth. Plus, it's trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, Apple is the opposite of Nvidia. Its sales declined throughout 2023. Even so, its stock skyrocketed. This makes little sense, and more headwinds are coming up: a U.S. International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume). With all this in mind, 2024 could be a tough year for the company. And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than \"Magnificent Seven\" members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), it doesn't make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft and Tesla need to show me some results\n\nI view Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently. Microsoft had a strong year, as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose. However, Microsoft trades at a steep premium, even on a forward earnings basis. MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nMicrosoft is executing well, but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying. Still, it's far from a sell.\n\nTesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street, as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products. It's also set to face some added headwinds. Starting in 2024, some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them.\n\nWhen judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock, I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends. For Tesla, these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022. TSLA PE Ratio Chart\n\nI'm taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesn't look like a bargain at these prices.\n\nAdvertising should bounce back in 2024\n\nThat leaves Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category. These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year.\n\nEven though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments, they are mostly advertising businesses. In 2022 and 2023, the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming. However, now that we have lapped that pullback, Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses. Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24%, respectively, in Q3.\n\nNext year should be another strong recovery year for advertising, which will boost both companies.\n\nAmazon has also had a strong 2023, with its margins rising. AMZN Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nHowever, this chart doesn't tell the full story, as this takes into account Amazon's profits over the past 12 months. If you focus on its latest quarterly results, Amazon's margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4, which is usually its strongest one. No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, but 2024 could give us a glimpse, making it a strong buy now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "10 Stock Market Predictions for 2024",
        "content": "As investors ready to ring in the new year, they have to be thrilled with Wall Street's performance in 2023. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) recently climbed to a record high, with the benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gaining 25% and 44%, year to date, through the closing bell on Dec. 28.\n\nBut it's not about where Wall Street has been, so much as where the stock market is headed next. If there were such a thing as a perfect forecasting tool, everyone would be using it. Unfortunately, there isn't, which means the best we can do as investors is use a combination of history, macro and company-specific data, and our experience, to make predictions about the future.\n\nWhat follows are 10 stock market predictions -- including macro predictions that can have bearing on the performance of equities -- for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. The U.S. economy will dip into a recession\n\nTo start with, the most-anticipated recession in U.S. history will finally take shape in the new year.\n\nThe Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI), which is comprised of 10 inputs and attempts to anticipate turning points in the business cycle, has declined for 19 consecutive months. With the exception of a 22-month decline from 1973-1975 and a 24-month tumble during the Great Depression, we've never seen a clearer sign that an economic slowdown is expected.\n\nFollowing the money also offers a potentially chilling tale for Wall Street, at least in the very short term. Commercial bank credit has declined since mid-February, which signals that banks are purposefully tightening their lending standards.\n\nMeanwhile, M2 money supply is notably falling for the first time since the Great Depression. Less available money for transactions has historically been a telltale sign that an economic downturn is on the horizon.\n\n2. The bear market returns in 2024\n\nAlthough the U.S. economy and stock market aren't tied at the hip, a downturn in the economy tends to have a negative impact on corporate earnings. History tells us that roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500's drawdowns since the start of the Great Depression in September 1929 have occurred after, not prior to, a recession being declared. In other words, if (key word!) a recession was to materialize, a bear market for stocks would probably follow.\n\nStory continues S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nSomething else to consider is that stocks aren't cheap. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings ratio (also known as the \"cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio) ended Dec. 28 at 32.36. That's about 90% higher than its average reading of 17.07, when back-tested 154 years.\n\nFurther, there have only been six instances since 1870 where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E surpassed 30. Following the previous five occasions, the broader market went on to lose between 20% and 89% of its value. While the Shiller P/E isn't a timing tool, it does suggest that extended periods of premium valuations aren't well-tolerated by Wall Street.\n\n3. The second-longest yield-curve inversion on record will end\n\nThe yield curve, which is a chart depicting the yields of various Treasury debt securities relative to their maturity dates, has often been a tell of what's to come for the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nThe US Yield Curve (10-year minus 3-month) has now been inverted for 427 consecutive days, the 2nd longest streak in history. Will likely become the longest inversion ever in February 2024. pic.twitter.com/l1q7cVMwSx\n\n-- Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) December 27, 2023\n\nFor the past 428 calendar days, as of Dec. 28, the yield curve that compares the 10-year Treasury bond to three-month Treasury bills has been inverted. This is to say that shorter-dated debt securities (i.e., the three-month bill) have higher yields than the longer-dated bond. While a yield-curve inversion doesn't guarantee that a U.S. recession is imminent, every recession since World War II has been preceded by an inversion.\n\nThough the current inversion is likely to become the longest on record (currently 469 calendar days, set between Nov. 1965 and March 1967), it's unlikely to persist throughout the new year. With the nation's central bank expected to begin a rate-easing cycle, it wouldn't be surprising for the yield curve to normalize by year's end.\n\n4. One of Wall Street's most-hated industries will thrive\n\nIf the Treasury yield curve inversion ends in 2024, highly interest-sensitive companies could benefit. This includes one of Wall Street's most universally disliked industries: mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nPopular mortgage REITs like Annaly Capital Management(NYSE: NLY) and AGNC Investment(NASDAQ: AGNC) make their living by borrowing money at low short-term lending rates and use this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). The greater the gap between the average yield on owned assets less average borrowing rate (this difference is known as \"net interest margin\"), the more profitable a mortgage REIT can be.\n\nThe yield-curve inversion has narrowed the net interest margin for mortgage REITs and made short-term borrowing costlier. But an end to this inversion, coupled with dovish Fed monetary policy, could make Annaly Capital Management and AGNC Investment absolutely sparkle in the eyes of income seekers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Core inflation will remain stubbornly high, if not reaccelerate\n\nMost investors are likely thrilled with the Federal Reserve forecasting three rate cuts in 2024. When interest rates decline, it encourages companies to borrow, which can accelerate corporate hiring, fuel acquisition activity, and bolster innovation.\n\nBut there's another side to this coin. In recent memory, the Fed has cut rates in response to a growth slowdown. During the third quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis notes that U.S. gross domestic product increased by a red-hot 5.2%. With the nation's central bank planning to reduce rates in 2024, it risks reaccelerating the rate of inflation.\n\nThe core inflation rate, which removes volatile food and energy costs from the equation, could be particularly stubborn in 2024. A rapid uptick in mortgage rates has effectively frozen the housing market. Nothing short of a hard landing for the U.S. economy is likely to bring the core inflation down to the Fed's long-term target of 2%.\n\n6. The artificial intelligence (AI) bubble will begin to burst\n\nOne of the primary catalysts that sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite screaming higher in 2023 is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI, which involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks typically assigned to humans, can add nearly $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to researchers at PwC.\n\nHowever, history isn't on the side of AI's continued success -- at least in the short run. Every single next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has gone through an initial bubble period. While many of these trends produced big-time winners over the long-term, the internet, business-to-business commerce, genomics, 3D printing, marijuana, blockchain technology, and the metaverse are just some of the examples of highly touted \"new trends\" that weren't initially given enough time to mature.\n\nThe potential bubble-popping event for AI could come from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has established itself as the infrastructure backbone of AI-accelerated data centers. Graphics processing unit (GPU) scarcity has sent Nvidia's pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs through the roof in 2023. But as production expands in the new year and competition picks up, Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin appear likely to take a hit.\n\n7. Microsoft will surpass Apple to become the most-valuable public company\n\nWith few exceptions over the past decade, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been the world's largest publicly traded company by market cap. Apple's innovation has been the driving force behind its success. It remains the leading smartphone company by market share in the U.S., and its subscription services segment is rapidly evolving.\n\nBut when examined as a whole, Apple's growth engine has stalled. All of the company's physical products endured sales declines in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023). While a greater than $600 billion share repurchase program since the start of 2013 has helped lift the company's earnings per share, it's no longer the growth story it once was.\n\nWith Apple failing to deliver in the growth department, it's Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) that stands ready to ascend to the top of the pedestal. Microsoft Azure accounted for 25% of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the third quarter, according to Canalys. The company is also benefiting from the abundant cash flow of its legacy operations (e.g., Windows and Office), and its steady stream of acquisitions. Microsoft has the necessary catalysts to become the world's most-valuable public company in 2024.\n\n8. Tesla will fall below $100 per share\n\nKeeping with the theme of Wall Street's most-important and widely owned companies, I fully expect the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker by market cap, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), to fall below $100 per share in the new year. For context, Tesla shares closed at roughly $253 with one trading day left in 2023.\n\nTesla's pricing strategy is a potentially major red flag. During the company's annual shareholder meeting in May, CEO Elon Musk noted that Tesla's pricing strategy is based on demand. With the company slashing prices on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions in 2023, it pretty clearly signals that demand is faltering, inventory levels are rising, and competition is picking up. Tesla's once superior operating margin is now on-par with the auto industry average.\n\nFurthermore, Elon Musk continues to be a tangible risk for Tesla's shareholders. Despite being a visionary, he frequently overpromises and underdelivers when it comes to new innovations. Though Tesla is valued as a do-it-all company in the energy and auto space, it generates the bulk of its profit from selling and leasing EVs (the auto industry usually sports single-digit earnings multiples), and is reliant on unsustainable sources of income for a sizable percentage of its profit. ^SPXUS Chart\n\n9. Utilities will be a top-3 sector in 2024\n\nNext up is the prognostication that the worst-performing sector for the S&P 500 in 2023 will be one of the three best-performing sectors in the new year. I'm talking about utilities.\n\nMost investors flock to utility stocks because of their low volatility, market-topping dividends, and predictable operating performance. But with Treasury yields soaring in response to the Fed's aggressive rate-hiking cycle, investors bid adieu to utilities and opted to purchase Treasury bonds instead. This led to a very poor year for a traditionally safe sector.\n\nBut with the central bank looking to ease interest rates in 2024, utilities are back on the radar as a potential outperformer. The dividend yields of utilities should become more attractive as Treasury bond yields decline. Further, access to cheaper borrowing rates may fuel acquisitions and major projects that ultimately lift growth rates for the sector's major players -- I'm looking at you, NextEra Energy.\n\n10. A short-lived \"crisis\" will take shape\n\nLast but not least is the prediction that an unforeseen event will, at least temporarily, weigh down Wall Street.\n\nAlmost every year features an unexpected event that wreaks havoc on the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. For instance, 2023 saw the short-lived regional banking crisis threaten the fabric of the financial system. The failure of three sizable banks created ripples throughout the financial sector that had investors questioning the solvency of rock-solid banking institutions.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine served as the year's tumultuous event. The geopolitical implications of Russia's invasion led to a short-term malaise for equities.\n\nThough it's impossible to predict what short-term crisis might unfold in 2024, the best guess I can offer is a housing price collapse, or perhaps a wave of auto loan defaults.\n\nOnly time will tell if this or any of these predictions comes to fruition in the new year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

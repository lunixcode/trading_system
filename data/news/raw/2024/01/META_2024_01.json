        "title": "Nevada attorney general launches go-it-alone lawsuits against social media firms in state court",
        "content": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nevada's state attorney general has launched a go-it-alone legal fight against five popular social media platforms, alleging they have created, in one instance “an addiction machine,” and that they deliberately exploit children too young to have a capacity for self-control.\n\nA trio of lawsuits filed in state court in Las Vegas seek unspecified damages from TikTok, Snapchat and Meta Platforms, the owner of Instagram, Facebook and Messenger, on claims including deceptive trade practices and negligence.\n\n“All of these platforms use features ... to maximize youth use, manipulate young emotions, and exploit children’s developing minds — all for massive financial gain,” state Attorney General Aaron Ford said in a statement about the lawsuits filed Tuesday.\n\n“Each of these platforms has also been linked to serious dangers to kids, including auto accidents, increases in drug overdoses, suicides, eating disorders, sexual exploitation and more,” the statement said.\n\nThe lawsuits were filed just ahead of testimony in Congress on Wednesday by top executives of Meta, TikTok, Snap Inc. and other platforms.\n\nTikTok representative Michael Hughes declined in an email on Wednesday to comment about the legal case but pointed to posted policies and parental controls that he said were designed to prioritize the safety and “digital well-being” of teens.\n\n“We do not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide or self-harm, or content that promotes unhealthy eating behaviors or habits that are likely to cause adverse health outcomes,” the email said.\n\nSnap Inc. spokesperson Ashley Adams said in a statement the site opens to a camera, not a scrolling feed of content, “and has no traditional public likes or comments.”\n\n“We feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence,” the statement said.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta did not respond to an email inquiry. But before Congress, company CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to Republican Sen. Josh Hawley's invitation to issue an apology directly to “families of victims.” Some parents at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing held photos of their children who died by suicide.\n\n“I’m sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered,” Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta continues to invest and work on “industry-wide efforts” to protect children.\n\nNevada was not among more than 33 states that filed suit in October against Meta in federal court in California, alleging that features on Instagram and Facebook are designed to addict children.\n\nJohn Sadler, a spokesperson for Ford, declined to say whether the Nevada lawsuits were timed to coincide with the congressional hearing.\n\nBut Sadler acknowledged the decision to file the cases in state court instead of joining other states in federal court follows a path the state took in opioid damages claims. Nevada reached multiyear settlements with pharmaceutical companies, retailers and others in those cases that are expected to reap more than $1 billion for the state.\n\nFord, a Democrat, enlisted participation in the Nevada case from three prominent personal injury law firms based in Las Vegas, Dallas and Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\n“Social media platforms are a bottomless pit where users can spend an infinite amount of their time,” Nevada said in the Snapchat complaint. “It demands our attention first thing in the morning and last thing at night, at the dinner table, while we're walking down the street, even when we are driving.”\n\n“Much like an illegal drug, Snapchat has been designed to be an addiction machine,” the court filing said.\n\nEach complaint also cites a 2019 Psychology Today article by Mike Brooks, titled “The ‘Vegas Effect’ of Our Screens,\" that compares compulsive social media use to the effect of gamblers sitting at slot machines and playing “for hours on end.”",

        "title": "Social Media CEOs testify before Congress: Top Takeaways",
        "content": "The CEOs of top social media companies, including Meta (META) founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, X Corp CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, Discord CEO Jaso Citron, and Snapchat (SNAP) cofounder & CEO Evan Spiegel, were grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this Wednesday on whether or not their platforms put children at risk for online sexual abuse & exploitation. The hearing was fiery & confrontational, with the parents of victims amongst the attendees in the audience. Here are the top takeaways investors need to know:\n\nVictims state their case (00:00:12):\n\nRepublican Senator from Illinois Dick Durbin opened the hearing with a harrowing video, where victims detailed how they were sexually exploited on the various social media platforms. The video also included parents who had lost their children from suicide due to the bullying and harassment they experienced online. It was a strong opening salvo for the Judiciary Committee that immediately put the tech CEOs on the back foot.\n\nSenator Klobuchar vs. Discord CEO Jason Citron (00:01:13)\n\nDemocratic Senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar took on Discord CEO Jason Citron on whether or not he would support her legislation titled The Shield Act. The law would criminalize the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images online. Without a firm answer from Mr. Citron, the Senator erupted in frustration: \"I just want to get this stuff done, I am so tired of this it's been 28 years since the Internet and we haven't passed any of these bills? Everyone is double-talk, double-talk, it's time to actually pass them. And the reason they haven't passed is because of the power of your companies.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg confronted by grieving families (00:01:29)\n\nMeta (META) founder & CEO Mark Zuckerberg was ambushed during the hearing when Republican Senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley, prompted Zuckerberg to apologize to the victims & families in the audience. Hawley stated \"There are families of victims here today, would you like to apologize to them now? They're here, you are on national television, would you like to apologize to the families who were harmed by your product?\" Zuckerberg promptly stood up and addressed the families of the victims as they held up photos of their loved ones. Zuckerberg addressed the audience saying: \"I'm sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered.\"\n\nAlthough the hearing resulted in many dynamic and powerful moments, it is not clear whether any legislation will be passed against the social media giants. However, it seems that if there is any sort of bipartisan issue still left in Congress, regulation of social media is something both parties can work across the aisle on accomplishing.",

Would you like now to apologize to the victims who have been harmed by your product? Show them the pictures. Would you like to apologize for what you've done to these good people?\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg apologizing to families of victims at a Senate Judiciary Committee today on safety and social media. Zuckerberg was among the tech execs facing questioning from lawmakers over allegations of abuse on sites like Instagram, TikTok, and X.\n\nJoining us now, Jeff Horowitz, Wall Street Journal technology reporter. Jeff, it's good to have you on the show. Maybe just to start, Jeff, give me your take on what we saw on Capitol Hill today. What did you learn, Jeff?\n\nJEFF HORWITZ: I think we have-- like, right now, there is a push to get child safety legislation through. Obviously, the history of regulating social media companies out of Washington has been, shall we say, very limited as the senators themselves observed. And look, there's certainly some dramatic moments, and I think there's no question that people on both sides of the aisle are very angry with the company.\n\nUnlike with previous hearings, say, about things involving politics, there was at least a little more of a consensus as to what the platforms would need to be doing better, namely investing more and being a little more thoughtful in their feature designs and perhaps giving up some of the usage that they-- that's kind of the lifeblood of the platforms in exchange for safety. That said, I think the specifics of some of the questioning-- there's long been a question as to whether or not the current Congress, particularly given it's the age of most of its members, is well-suited to this field of regulation. And I think that will still be outstanding.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: I mean, at the same time, they see the effects, right, that these problems are having, I mean, when it struck by the fact that Zuckerberg said that science has not shown a causal link between social media and mental health outcomes among young people. So even if they don't know exactly how to fix the problem, it seems as though the they understand the scope of the problem, right? So what are the next steps here, I guess, if there even are any?\n\nJEFF HORWITZ: Yeah. So Zuckerberg said that there was no like causal link on the population level. And that is I think a number of caveats already embedded to the statement. And as the senators noted, the best understanding inside Meta by Meta's own researchers was, in fact, that there are known instances and foreseeable instances in which the platforms could be expected to cause harm under certain circumstances.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's say it's a net negative for the world or that it's responsible for teen suicides, just that there are-- it's the company's own work at this point is pretty damning on a few fronts. And that stuff has been brought into the public and, obviously, by both attorneys general and the press.\n\nNow what's next I think is the question of whether any of this stuff results in bills that get to a floor or get to the floor of the Senate. As the committee members themselves have noted, the legislations come out of committee before in unanimous fashion. It just hasn't ever received a vote. And that's something that the Senate leadership obviously has some control about. And likewise in the House.\n\nSo I don't know that there's certainty as to where this goes. But if there is going to be a place where Congress does decide to pass legislation regulating social media, this would be it.",

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks Set for a Post-Earnings Take Off",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been hot property over the past few months. With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence and the massive demand for data centers, several companies are making the most of this phase and reporting impressive revenue numbers. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already an industry leader, and it can become difficult to match its rally, other tech stocks are slowly but steadily expanding their market share and could report impressive numbers in the coming weeks. The earnings season is an ideal time to invest in stocks that show high growth potential. Here are the three tech stocks post-earnings ready for take-off. Grab them before they are gone!\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest competitor of Nvidia this year could be the year of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company has faced several challenges in the past but its recent fourth-quarter results are impressive. It beat analyst expectations, and the revenue saw a 10% year-over-year increase to $6.2 billion. The net income hit $667 million, which is a significant rise from $21 million in the same quarter the prior year.\n\nThis is an impressive feat, and there is no stopping AMD. Higher revenue and improved profits are driven by the improvement in the data center segment and the company’s ability to focus on the core business areas. The data center saw a 38% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter, and I believe the company is only getting started. This is a sign that the company’s new products have got a positive response and it could enjoy a robust performance in the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock has the potential to double in the coming months. It might not be able to enjoy a rally like Nvidia, but it can generate significant gains. AMD has already positioned itself as one of the best alternatives for Nvidia chips with the new chip launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral tech giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), have shown interest in using AMD chips. It also enjoys a price advantage over Nvidia’s chips. AMD has a diverse range of products that meet the needs of every consumer. Improved revenue stream and higher adoption of the chips will help AMD soar to new highs this year. Buy the stock before it skyrockets.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a tech giant, and the company has been a winner in the AI space. It already has an established market and is known for its database software which is growing due to generative AI offerings. The company has seen strong demand for its cloud services and saw a significant 52% revenue jump in the cloud infrastructure for the third quarter which came in at $1.6 billion. One big reason to invest in Oracle stock is its partnership with Microsoft Azure, where it is ramping up the data centers and building new ones.\n\nThe future of Oracle is cloud, and this is where it will achieve success. I am expecting record quarterly revenue from the company, and the stock could take off after the earnings. ORCL stock is up by 8% year to date. Once the company reports results, we could see the stock soar. It also boasts a modest dividend yield of 1.40%.\n\nI consider Oracle to be a safe haven stock and have recommended it in the past as well. Since most of its success comes from cloud infrastructure services, it is here to stay and has become highly reliable in terms of revenue growth. The company is aggressively building data centers, and as it scales up the cloud segment, we could see an improvement in the operating margin.\n\nAfter the quarterly results, the management mentioned that the demand for its data centers was “astronomical” and this is something to be excited about. Oracle is now stronger than ever, and this is the time for cloud computing businesses. You will regret not buying this stock.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best tech stocks to add to your portfolio, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is known as a global e-commerce giant, but it is so much more than that. It has become more of a tech company today and is using AI to leverage sales.\n\nWhile Amazon needs no introduction, its subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services company in the world with a massive market. The company might have announced results while you read this, and I am certain that the positive numbers will take the stock on an upward momentum. I believe Amazon will report an exceptional quarter driven by Prime Day, holiday shopping, and a rise in advertising revenue.\n\n2024 could be a stellar year for the company as it shows positive signs of growth with rising demand for AWS. In the third quarter results, AWS revenue increased 12% year over year to hit $23.1 billion, and with the generative AI offerings, we should expect the same level of growth to continue in 2024. The total operating income in the quarter was $11.2 billion out of which $7 billion was from AWS. I am highly optimistic about the future of Amazon and believe it will soar this year.\n\nThe stock is up by 52% in the year and is close to the 52-week high of $161. The stock hasn’t moved much over the past month but could take off post-earnings. This is one blue-chip stock to buy and hold forever.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It took just under two hours, but Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg eventually received a congressional dressing down over child safety, culminating in a remarkable scene where the billionaire stood up and issued a rare public apology to users of his company’s services.\n\nAs the founder and CEO of Meta, the world’s most prominent social media company, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg drew particular scrutiny from lawmakers on Wednesday during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the child safety policies of online platforms.\n\nTwo Republican senators known for both their firebrand personalities and outspoken criticism of Big Tech, Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tx.), pressed Zuckerberg about claims he’d made in his opening statement that there was no evidence linking social media use to declines in teen mental health.\n\nTo close his allotted seven minutes of time for questions, Hawley took the remarkable step of urging Zuckerberg to apologize to the families of teenagers who had been victims of online sexual abuse, some of whom committed suicide. A visibly uncomfortable Zuckerberg then turned around, faced the gallery, and addressed the audience of reporters and parents holding up signs with pictures of their deceased children.\n\n\"It's terrible,” Zuckerberg told them. “No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered. And this is why we invest so much and are going to continue doing industry-leading efforts to make sure that no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.\"\n\nMany of the families in the audience were parents of teenagers who had suffered either sexual abuse or exploitation online or had faced severe mental health struggles as a result of their social media use. Underage victims had been extorted over the release of nude pictures—a crime now referred to as “sextortion”—contacted by child molesters, overdosed on drugs purchased on the platforms, and developed eating disorders when social media algorithms promoted content about them.\n\nStory continues\n\nZuckerberg’s apology came after Hawley accused him of “taking no action” to address these issues when they were brought to his attention over the years.\n\nHawley also questioned why Zuckerberg and Meta hadn’t compensated any of the victims, to which Zuckerberg replied it was his job to “build tools” that keep Facebook and Instagram users safe.\n\nHawley shot back that “your job is to be responsible for what your company has done.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will look into the 25 most innovative economies in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Most Innovative Economies in 2024: Why WIPO Rankings Are Inaccurate.\n\nVarious researchers have defined innovation as an indicator of national competitiveness. While others linked it to the economic growth of a country. However, many factors contribute to a country's innovation, including its research and development and ability to adopt technologies and produce market-competitive products and services.\n\nWhy WIPO Rankings Are Inaccurate\n\nThe Global Innovation Index is considered a significant tool for identifying the most innovative country, by utilizing a variety of indicators. While GII might be an established index to provide a holistic view of innovation in a country, some of its indicators, such as institutions and other governance and infrastructure indicators, do not have a direct impact on innovation, compared to prominent indicators such as R&D or innovative technology product exports. This is what makes the WIPO ranking inaccurate as it equally weights all the factors to compute a final innovation index, instead of prioritizing factors that directly impact the scientific and technological innovations in a country.\n\nThe GII ranks Switzerland as the most innovative country in the world. While Switzerland has made significant progress in science and technology in the past years, the United States is undoubtedly the most innovative economy in the world. As of 2023, the US boasts a GDP of $26.95 trillion and is a leader in science and technology. More than 75% of the most innovative companies in the world are based in the US. The country is home to some of the top universities and research institutes including MIT, Harvard, and Stanford University, among others. The United States also stands as a global leader in sectors including health, finance, and energy, among others. The US is tentatively the biggest research and development spender in the world. It spent a total of $789 billion in R&D in 2021, up $72 billion from 2020. On the other hand, Switzerland reported a total spending of only $35 billion in 2022. These factors combined, position the United States as the most innovative country in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies Contributing to the Innovation in the US\n\nCompanies including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are ruling the US market with their continued innovation and scientific breakthroughs.\n\nWall Street is bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). On January 22, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos raised his price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $175 from $170 and reiterated a buy rating. Over the past 3 months, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has received 37 buy ratings from analysts. The stock has an average price target of $187.40 and a high price target of $220. As of January 31, the stock has surged more than 50% over the past 12 months.\n\nHere are some of the comments from Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"During the quarter, we hosted Amazon Accelerate, our annual seller conference, where we launched a number of new innovations and product developments for our sellers, including Supply Chain by Amazon. We also continue to see durable growth in advertising which grew 25% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by sponsored products as we lean into machine learning to improve the relevancy of the ads we show our customers and enhance our measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers. We have seen strong improvement in our profitability. North America operating income was $4.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9%, up 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen 6 consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of over 700 basis points over these past 6 quarters.\"\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a powerhouse of innovation with its top-notch AI-integrated tools. The company promotes the integration of AI in business processes and daily life to accelerate innovation. On September 27, 2023, the company announced several AI-assisted features across its devices and applications, including AI stickers and editing tools and a conversational AI assistant called Meta AI. Moreover, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is set to launch AI characters and AI studios and creation tools in 2024.\n\nOn January 23, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched Chrome M121 along with experimental generative AI features. The new features will allow efficient browsing and personalized experience for users. The new generative AI features will be available in Chrome on Macs and Windows PCs soon, starting first in the US. The users can navigate to the experimental AI page by going to the settings option in their Chrome account.\n\nWith this context, let's look at the 25 most innovative economies in 2024. 20 Most Competitive Economies In The World\n\n20 Most Competitive Economies In The World\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our article, we defined an innovative country as one that invests highly in research and development and integrates digital technology into its economy. To rank the 25 most innovative economies in 2024, we employed three metrics including R&D Expenditure, High Technology Exports in US$, and Digital Adoption Index (DAI). High technology exports showcase a country's ability to transform its R&D into commercial products and services competing globally. This provided us with a solid framework to identify and rank the most innovative economies in 2024.\n\nFirstly, we sorted the countries based on R&D expenditure and collated a list of 40 countries. Then, we sourced DAI and high-technology exports data of the countries. Then, we assigned ranks to our countries based on each metric, with 1 representing the most innovative country. Finally, we assigned weights to each of our metrics as 40% to R&D Expenditure, 40% to High Technology Exports, and 20% to DAI and computed a weighted average of each country's rank across these metrics to calculate their final score as 'Insider Monkey Score'. Our list ranks the countries in descending order of the calculated score.\n\nOur list does not include Israel due to the current geopolitical situation in the country. Israel's war on Gaza has caused major economic losses in the country disrupting businesses, which makes it challenging to assess its innovation. Hence, we have only included countries that demonstrate resilience and adaptability to foster innovation amidst global political challenges.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "nick clegg\n\nMark Zuckerberg rejected pleas from Sir Nick Clegg to hire dozens of staff to help protect children on Facebook and Instagram, internal emails show.\n\nNewly published communications from within Meta show Sir Nick, the company’s head of global affairs, asked Mr Zuckerberg for permission to hire a minimum of 45 staff and up to 124, saying it would allow the company to live up to its promises.\n\nMr Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief, turned down the request, which “lost out to the various other pressures and priorities” at the social media giant, according to the emails.\n\nThe documents were released ahead of a combative Congressional hearing on Wednesday in which the heads of Meta, X (formerly known as Twitter), Snap, TikTok and Discord were told they have “blood on your hands” for failing to protect children.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham told the executives: “You have a product that’s killing people.”\n\nIt comes amid multiple efforts by US politicians to pass new laws targeted at social media companies over the blackmail of children and the sharing of illegal abuse images.\n\nThe Meta emails show that in August 2021, Sir Nick emailed Mr Zuckerberg to say: “We need to do more and we are being held back by a lack of investment on the product side, which means we’re not able to make changes and innovations at the pace required to be responsive to policymaker concerns.\n\n“Our wellbeing work is both understaffed and fragmented across teams which is why we view the proposed investment outlined below as important.\n\n“We are not on track to succeed for our core wellbeing topics (problematic use, bullying & harassment, connections, and SSI [suicide and self-harm]) and are at increased regulatory risk and external criticism.” Mark Zuckerberg was visibly frustrated while facing questions - Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIn a subsequent email three months later, apparently after the request was turned down, he asked for a reduced team of 32 staff. Sir Nick wrote that there was “increased urgency of all this”, adding: “This investment is important to ensure we have the product roadmaps necessary to stand behind our external narrative of wellbeing on our apps and soon in the metaverse”.\n\nStory continues\n\nMr Zuckerberg’s response was not recorded, but a separate Meta email said: “Nick did email Mark to emphasise his support for the package but it lost out to the various other pressures and priorities”.\n\nDemocrat Senator Richard Blumenthal told Mr Zuckerberg: “Nick Clegg was pleading with you for resources to back up the narrative, to fulfil the commitments… you rejected that request.”\n\nMr Zuckerberg did not respond to the release of the emails directly although a spokesman said: “These cherry-picked documents do not provide the full context of how the company operates or what decisions were made.”\n\nMeta’s chief executive appeared alongside Linda Yaccarino from X, Evan Spiegel from Snap, Shou Zi Chew from TikTok and Jason Citron from Discord for four hours in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ms Yaccarino, Mr Spiegel and Mr Citron appeared only after legal demands from the committee.\n\nMr Zuckerberg, who has strived to appear deferential in previous US hearings, was visibly frustrated at questioning, telling Senator Tom Cruz: “Could you give me some time to speak?”\n\nIn response to Senator Marsha Blackburn’s claim that “you’re trying to be the premiere sex trafficking site”, he said: “That’s ridiculous.”\n\nDuring an exchange with Senator Josh Hawley, Mr Zuckerberg stood up to address dozens of parents in the audience, some of whom held up pictures of teenagers who committed suicide following abuse on social media.\n\nHe told them: “I’m sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered.”\n\nIn a separate exchange, Mr Graham drew attention to the resignation of one of TikTok’s most senior Israeli employees and said the video app was being used “to destroy the Jewish state”.\n\nBarak Herscowitz, a lobbyist in TikTok’s government relations team, said in a post on X: “I resigned from TikTok.\n\n“We live in a time when our very existence as Jews and Israelis is under attack and in danger. In such an unstable era, people’s priorities are sharpened.”\n\nThe news website Jewish Insider reported that Mr Herscowitz had been behind an internal memo at TikTok accusing the company of bias against Israel during the conflict in Gaza.\n\nMr Graham told Mr Chew during Wednesday’s hearing: “Your representative in Israel quit the company, because TikTok is being used, in a way, to destroy the Jewish state.”\n\nMr Chew responded saying: “I need to make it very clear that pro-Hamas content and hate speech is not allowed on our platform or within our company.”",

        "title": "20 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 countries with the largest Jewish population in the world. If you want to skip our discussion on the Jewish community, you can go directly to the 5 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World.\n\nJudaism is one of the oldest Abrahamic, monotheistic religions in the world. It has a rich cultural legacy that goes back thousands of years. The origins of the religion date back over 3500 years in the Canaan region. This area now constitutes Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territory. As of 2023, there are around 16.7 million Jews in the world. This means that Jews make up about 0.2% of the world's population. Compared to other Abrahamic religions like Christianity and Islam, this is quite a small ratio. Christianity and Islam are the two most popular religions in the world, accounting for about 56% of the world's population.\n\nWhile there is only a single Jewish state in the world at the moment, many countries are home to significant populations of Jews. It would be interesting to note that despite being a Jewish state, Israel isn’t the country with the highestJewish population in the world. Israel is home to 7.2 million Jews, accounting for 42.9% of the total Jewish population in the world. The global Jewish population has witnessed a steady growth trend since 1945, with a sharp rise in recent years. Between 2022 and 2023, the community recorded an increase from 15.25 million to 16.78 million people. A 2015 study by the Pew Research Centre predicted that the global Jewish population would reach 16 million by the year 2050. However, the Jewish population has exhibited a faster-than-expected growth rate and surpassed the 16 million mark already, with nearly 25 years remaining until 2050. According to the same study, the annual growth rate for the Jewish population was projected to be lower than the average global growth rate. This prediction proved accurate, as the world Jewish population experienced an annual growth rate of about 0.63% until 2018. In comparison, the average global population grew at a higher rate of 1.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nJewish Demographics in the United States\n\nThe United States of America is also among the countries with the largest Jewish population in the world. New York stands out as the state with the highest Jewish population, at about 1.7 million Jews. This means that New York is home to around 22% of America’s Jews and 10% of the total Jews in the world. California and Florida follow New York with the second and third-highest Jewish populations in the US. These three states have a higher number of Jewish residents than any country in the world, excluding Israel and the US. Meanwhile, Europe is home to about 8% of Jews in the world, with France in the leading position.

According to Forbes Israel, there were 267 Jewish billionaires in the world in 2022, with a collective net worth of $1.7 trillion. The majority of these Jewish billionaires hail from the United States. The top 10 billionaires on the list exclusively represented the United States and France, with the first appearance of an Israeli-Jewish billionaire occurring at the 22nd spot. Several business leaders in the United States belong to the Jewish community. Lawrence Ellison, the founder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), a key player in database management systems, stands as a prominent example. Larry Page, another prominent Jewish entrepreneur, gained fame as the co-founder of Google. Similarly, Shari Arison, a highly successful Jewish entrepreneur, is widely recognized as the wealthiest woman in Israel and the owner of Carnival Corp (NYSE:CCL). Arison has diversified her investment portfolio and also holds a 16% stake in Israel's largest bank, Hapoalim. Many of the world’s most prominent companies, including Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:META), and the New York Times (NYSE:NYT), are led by Jewish individuals. Major players in the entertainment and media industry are also affiliated with or owned by Jews. Furthermore, among the top 25 money managers in the history of American Capitalism, an impressive 17 are of Jewish descent. Some of the renowned names within this group include George Soros, James Simon, Steven Cohen, John Paulson, David Tepper, and Carl Icahn.\n\nHere's what Ensemble Capital Management said about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (8.52% weight in the Fund): Google’s earnings report in October showed its core advertising business accelerating to double digit growth as the digital advertising recession of 2022 and early 2023 fades away. However, the company’s Cloud division, which is expected to generate growth from selling access to artificial intelligence services, saw its growth rate slow modestly. Juxtaposed with Microsoft’s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google’s stock on the report. While the stock recovered to new highs by the end of the year, the earnings report set back caused the stock to trail behind the S&P 500 with a gain of 6.8% for the quarter.” 20 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World\n\nSean Pavone/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 countries with the largest Jewish populations in the world, we consulted the Jewish Virtual Library, which is the most comprehensive online repository of data and literature related to Judaism and Jews.

        "title": "Big Tech earnings are here. Fasten your seat belts.",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported better-than-expected earnings after the bell on Tuesday, but those results weren’t enough for Wall Street, as shares of both companies fell during trading Wednesday.\n\nAnd with Apple and Meta set to report their earnings on Thursday, the pressure is on for the duo to blow away analysts’ expectations if they hope their respective stocks will avoid the same fate.\n\nFor Microsoft, the news was a boon for its artificial intelligence efforts, which the company said contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth to its Azure cloud business. But Wall Street was less than enthusiastic about those results, sending shares lower by more than 1% on Wednesday and dropping the company’s market capitalization below $3 trillion. This is despite the fact that Microsoft topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, faced a harsher reckoning, with shares falling more than 6% on Wednesday. Alphabet took a gut shot after missing expectations for advertising revenue, though it did beat on the top and bottom lines and saw growth in its cloud business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at an event at the Chatham House think tank in London, Monday, Jan. 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFor Microsoft, the results seemingly show that Wall Street wants the company to squeeze more revenue out of its multibillion-dollar investments in generative AI technologies. For Alphabet, the market’s reaction points to a need to balance ad revenue growth with its deeper push into the cloud market.\n\nTwo other interesting points from the announcements: Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts on the company’s earnings call that Alphabet’s subscription services, like YouTube TV, Google One, etc., are now a $15 billion per year business. That’s up some five times since 2019.\n\nThe other surprising news came from Microsoft reporting that its gaming division, which now includes Activision Blizzard, is officially its third largest business. The group earned $7.1 billion, ahead of Windows, which took in $5.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple and Meta on deck\n\nMicrosoft and Google’s earnings may have come and gone, but the Big Tech parade keeps on moving, with Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) set to report their earnings on Thursday.\n\nApple’s announcement will help set the stage for 2024, giving Wall Street its first look at full-quarter iPhone 15 sales. Meta, meanwhile, will need to show analysts that its advertising business is continuing to rebound and how it will monetize its massive generative AI investments.\n\nApple’s Q1 earnings are easily its most anticipated in some time. Earlier this month, analysts at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple’s stock on concerns over iPhone sales in China. And on Tuesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released a report on Medium saying that he expects iPhone shipments to decline 15% year over year in 2024. Customers are selecting and buying Apple products at an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 29, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nKuo cited a resurgent Huawei as well as consumer interest in foldable and generative AI-powered phones as reasons for the potential slowdown in China.\n\nShares of Apple were down roughly 2% year to date on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThat early downward trend has cost Apple its spot as the richest publicly traded company by market capitalization. As of Tuesday, the company’s market cap topped out at $2.91 trillion, below new leader Microsoft’s $3.04 trillion market cap.\n\nApple is also in the midst of making major revisions to its App Store in Europe, as it seeks to comply with the EU’s new Digital Markets Act. The moves mean that Apple will open up devices to third-party app stores and cloud gaming services, including Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming.\n\nBut critics, including Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, say the changes are insufficient. In particular, they point to a new 0.50 euro Core Technology fee Apple will charge developers. The charge kicks in after developers record more than 1 million downloads in 12 months and will apply to each subsequent download. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nApple is also gearing up for the launch of its Vision Pro AR/VR headset on Feb. 2. The device, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is the first new product category from the company in nearly a decade, and could provide the company with a powerful new revenue stream. But that’s only if customers can get past the $3,499 price tag.\n\nThe company will need a strong performance in the quarter to justify its stock market performance of late. Shares of Meta are up 33% over the last three months and 164% over the last 12 months. That’s better than the stock performance of Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon over the same period.\n\nMeta is riding high on a rebound in its all-important advertising business after it was kneecapped by Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature and a steep decline in the digital ad market thanks to dizzying interest rates.\n\nBut Meta is still hemorrhaging money from its Reality Labs division, which is responsible for its metaverse work and Quest headsets. In Q3, the company reported the segment lost $3.7 billion in Q3 2023 alone. But with Apple’s headset coming shortly, Meta could see a knock-on effect for Quest headset sales.\n\nWe’ll see how this all shakes out come Thursday.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

During the hearing, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) spoke to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg (META) claiming that he, and the other companies represented at the hearing, \"have blood on your hands.\"\n\nWhile there are some protections in place, many argue that social media platforms need to do more to implement policies that protect children, while others say it is up to the government to act and put in proper legislation.\n\nMatt Perault, UNC Tech Policy Professor and Former Facebook Public Policy Director, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss social media executives testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the massive undertaking that is involved in regulating social media.\n\nPerault comments on what could be done to help: \"The question about solutions is a really, really hard one. This is an issue I think where there's a lot of unity amongst parents and amongst lawmakers that there is a challenge that we should address in some form.

But with that in mind, then, when you don't have any set federal regulations that really cover everything, and you have this sort of piecemeal approach from states, how difficult does that make it for something like social media, which is, essentially, borderless?\n\nStory continues\n\nMATT PERAULT: Well, so I think that's yet to be seen. I mean, first of all, there are 13 states that have passed legislation in this area, but that leaves a large number of states that have not. And so in those other states, there currently are no on-the-books protections in this area, at least explicitly related to online child safety. And I think you're right to point to the possibility of a patchwork of rules across states.\n\nAnd that's not good, I don't think, for companies that have to deal with lots of different compliance regimes. But it's also not good for users. I live in North Carolina. I have kids in North Carolina. The rights that I have as a parent and the rights that my kids have as potential users at some point of social media-- I don't think they should change when we drive from North Carolina to Virginia and we cross the border.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Matt, you mentioned the legislation we've seen at the state level. They range from setting a minimum age for some of these platforms to requiring parental consent. Are there any in particular that you have seen at the state level that you think have a lot of muscle in addressing this very issue about child exploitation?\n\nMATT PERAULT: So the question about solutions is a really, really hard one. This is an issue, I think, where there is a lot of unity amongst parents and amongst lawmakers that there is a challenge that we should address in some form. And as a parent, I feel a lot of sympathy with that perspective. I think the question is, how do we do it in a way that is respective of kids' rights to free expression and respect of kids' privacy?\n\nAnd that is really difficult to do in practice. It's extremely difficult. If you just take the baseline issue of in order to protect children, we need to know who is a child-- that's actually really difficult to do in practice. You can do things like require individuals to submit identification, but that, then, means that social media companies are collecting a lot more data about who their users are, including, potentially, collecting sensitive data like actual identification.\n\nAnd so even that baseline issue of just figuring out how do we identify who's a kid and who's not is really challenging. And so that's why I don't envy the position that lawmakers are in, where there's just an acute interest in addressing this issue. But the solutions are really, really difficult.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And we did hear ranking member, Senator Graham, talking about Section 230, which, essentially, protects social media companies from getting sued from some of the content that users post online. Now, that came out in 1996 when about 40 million people were using the internet-- currently looking at about five billion people online.\n\nSo in terms of the progression of how some of these social media companies have evolved, is, perhaps, revoking or adjusting Section 230 the way to do it? Because we are seeing this unwillingness to really self regulate in a way that's making a meaningful difference, especially when it comes to the mental health of children.\n\nMATT PERAULT: Yeah. So I think Section 230 is actually really important here in providing some of the protections that I think lawmakers want. I mean, first of all, it protects individual-- it makes it less likely that social media companies will censor users. And that's an issue that's really important to conservatives.\n\nAnd it also really makes explicit that social media companies have the ability to moderate content on their platform. And that's an issue that's particularly of interest to Democrats who want to make sure that tech companies take action to address harmful content. So I think social media-- I think Section 230 is likely more part of the solution than part of the problem.\n\nOur center at UNC has partnered with Lawfare and Slate to publish a list of all the 230 proposals that have been introduced in Congress over the last couple of years. And so if anybody wants to check that out, they can go to that website just to see the catalog of different approaches that lawmakers have used. I think the thing that is a little bit challenging in the discussions in this area is that lawmakers beat the drum on this, but they don't actually take action. And again, we're in an election year. So don't think that's likely we're likely to see much action in the coming months.",

        "content": "Earnings season steps it up a notch this week as over 400 companies are expected to report earnings. Many of them are large cap growth stocks, including several Magnificent 7 stocks like Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms.\n\nBut the Mag 7 aren’t the only stocks hitting new highs. There are plenty of other companies doing so as well, including some of the top growth stocks on the Street. We’re going to get earnings reports from these companies as well.\n\nCan They Beat Again?\n\nIt’s difficult to have a perfect earnings surprise track record. But even one or two misses, over the last 5 years, is a tremendous earnings surprise record because that time period included the pandemic.\n\nCompanies had to navigate government lockdowns and a spooked consumer. But these 5 have come out of it and are looking beyond the pandemic now.\n\nCan they beat and move higher?\n\n5 Must-See Earnings Charts\n\n1.    Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO)\n\nTractor Supply has only missed 4 times on earnings over the last 5 years but two of those misses were in 2023. However, it’s coming off of a beat last quarter.\n\nShares of Tractor Supply have rallied 19.1% over the last 3 months but are up just 1.6% over the last year. It trades with a forward P/E of 22 as the shares have stalled.\n\nShould Tractor Supply be on your short list?\n\n2. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nApple has a great earnings surprise track record. It has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2023.\n\nShares of Apple are up 31.5% in the last year and are hitting new all-time highs. It’s not cheap. Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.8.\n\nWill Apple’s report be a catalyst for even more new highs?\n\n3.    Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com has beat big over the last 4 quarters but had 3 misses prior to that time, in 2022.\n\nShares of Amazon.com are up 60.4% over the last year and are hitting new multi-year highs, but are not yet back to all-time highs. It’s not cheap, with a P/E of 43 but Amazon.com trades with a P/S ratio of just 3.0.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould Amazon.com be on your short list?\n\n4. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\n\nMeta Platforms has beat 4 quarters in a row. But the real story is the turnaround in the shares, which have skyrocketed 114% over the last year to new all-time highs.\n\nMeta Platforms has attractive valuations at a forward P/E of just 22.3.\n\nIs Meta Platforms too hot to handle in 2024?\n\n5. Deckers Outdoor Corp. (DECK)\n\nDeckers has two of the hottest shoe brands in UGG and Hoka. It also has a hot earnings surprise chart as it has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2021.\n\nShares of Deckers have soared 84% in the last year and are trading at new all-time highs. It’s not as cheap as it used to be, with a forward P/E of 32.\n\nIs Deckers too hot to handle in 2024?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN in her own personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "UPDATE 3-Meta, TikTok, X CEOs grilled by US Senators about child sexual exploitation",
        "content": "(Recasts throughout; adds quotes from Senator Cruz, background on X)\n\nBy David Shepardson and Makini Brice\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Wednesday grilled the biggest social media and messaging companies, saying they had failed to do enough to protect children from sexual predators on their platforms, and said Congress must quickly pass legislation.\n\nThe hearing marks the latest effort by lawmakers to address the concerns of parents and mental health experts that social media companies put profits over making sure their platforms do not harm children.\n\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg, you and the companies before us, I know you don't mean it to be so, but you have blood on your hands,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, referring to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"You have a product that's killing people.\"\n\nZuckerberg testified along with X CEO Linda Yaccarino, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, cited statistics from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children nonprofit group that showed financial \"sextortion,\" in which a predator tricks a minor into sending explicit photos and videos, had skyrocketed last year.\n\n\"This disturbing growth in child sexual exploitation is driven by one thing: changes in technology,\" Durbin said during the hearing.\n\nAs the hearing kicked off, the committee played a video in which children spoke about being victimized on the social media platforms.\n\n\"I was sexually exploited on Facebook,\" said one child in the video, who appeared in shadow.\n\nIn the hearing room, dozens of parents had stood waiting for the CEOs to enter, holding pictures of their children.\n\nX's Yaccarino said the company supported the STOP CSAM Act, legislation introduced by Durbin that seeks to hold tech companies accountable for child sexual abuse material and would allow victims to sue tech platforms and app stores.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bill is one of several aimed at addressing child safety. None have become law.\n\nX, formerly Twitter, has come under heavy criticism since Elon Musk bought the platform and loosened moderation policies. This week, the company blocked searches for pop singer Taylor Swift after fake sexually explicit images of Swift spread on the platform.\n\nWednesday also marked the first appearance by TikTok CEO Chew before U.S. lawmakers since March when the Chinese-owned short video app company faced harsh questions, including some suggesting the app was damaging children's mental health.\n\n\"We make careful product design choices to help make our app inhospitable to those seeking to harm teens,\" Chew said, adding TikTok's community guidelines strictly prohibit anything that puts \"teenagers at risk of exploitation or other harm -- and we vigorously enforce them.\"\n\nChew disclosed more than 170 million Americans used TikTok monthly -- 20 million more than the company said last year.\n\nUnder questioning by Graham, he said TikTok would spend more than $2 billion on trust and safety efforts, but declined to say how the figure compared to the company's overall revenue.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz grilled Zuckerberg about warning screens on Instagram that alerted users an image might show child sexual abuse, but still allowed them to see the image.\n\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg, what the hell were you thinking?\" Cruz said.\n\nZuckerberg responded that it can be helpful to redirect users to resources rather than blocking content, adding the company would follow up with more information about the notice.\n\nHe reiterated earlier in the hearing that the company had no plans to move forward with a previous idea to create a kids version of Instagram.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar on Wednesday questioned what she said was inaction in the tech industry, comparing it to the response shown when a panel blew out of a Boeing plane earlier this month.\n\n\"When a Boeing plane lost a door in flight several weeks ago, nobody questioned the decision to ground a fleet. ... So why aren't we taking the same type of decisive action on the danger of these platforms when we know these kids are dying?\" Klobuchar said.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The heads of five of the largest social media platforms were set to appear before Congress Wednesday to testify about what their companies are doing to keep kids safe online.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk’s $55 Billion Pay Package Voided, Threatening World’s Biggest Fortune Trump Risks Losing More Than Half of Swing-State Voters If Found Guilty Byron Allen’s Latest Takeover Attempt: Paramount for $14 Billion Novo Nordisk Smashes Past $500 Billion Value on Wegovy Frenzy  Microsoft Sales Top Estimates; Cloud Growth Disappoints Some\n\nThe 21-member Senate Judiciary Committee called leaders of Meta Platforms Inc., X, Snap Inc., Discord Inc. and TikTok to Washington in an effort to hold them accountable for their platforms’ impact on teenagers and children.\n\nCongress has been under pressure to respond to mounting criticism of the spread of child sexual abuse material online and the tech companies’ failure to protect children from predators. They’ll also grill the executives on the effect social media use has on young people’s mental health.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, is holding the hearing to generate momentum for the committee’s legislation targeting online child sexual exploitation. The highly anticipated event kicked off with reporters, industry officials, and youth online safety advocates sitting in a packed Capitol Hill hearing room.\n\nLawmakers have examined children’s online safety in previous hearings, but Wednesday marks the first time Congress convened the executives to discuss the matter as part of a broader effort to move legislation forward.\n\nAccusations have been growing that the companies knowingly allowed underage users on their sites and ignored concerns their products could be harmful to teens’ mental health. TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, are facing lawsuits in California that claim the companies were negligent and ignored the potential harms their platforms created for teens.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, no stranger to the congressional hot seat, has prepared testimony that includes a pledge to work with lawmakers, parents, and other tech companies to make those platforms safer for teenagers. Meta has faced significant pushback over the years for its child safety practices and Zuckerberg will discuss on Wednesday the many tools that Meta has rolled out to protect young people, including parental controls that set time limits on app usage, notifications to review privacy settings, and restrictions on interactions with adults.\n\nHe’ll also have to answer questions about the fact that he rejected requests from his top leadership in 2021 to expand teams overseeing child safety and well-being, according to documents and emails released by Congress ahead of the hearing. The company emails were given to the committee in response to a letter sent by lawmakers to Meta that asked for documents related to the company’s research on the mental and physical health harms associated with its products.\n\nEarlier: Tech CEOs Brace for Senate Scrutiny on Children’s Safety\n\nUnlike Zuckerberg, Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, Snap’s Evan Spiegel and Jason Citron of Discord have never testified before Wednesday. Each of their companies has been under fire over reports of child sexual abuse material on their platforms, and the executives plan to discuss their methods to detect and remove such content.\n\nTikTok, which is owned by ByteDance Ltd. of China, has also faced backlash over children’s safety and CEO Shou Chew plans to defend his company’s practices to protect young users. He last appeared before a House committee nearly a year ago. As part of Chew’s testimony, TikTok will pledge to spend $2 billion this year on trust and safety globally, as the popular video service crosses 170 million monthly active users in the US.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, tech industry whistleblowers, parents, and teenagers themselves have repeatedly called on Congress to improve safety online as evidence suggests social media use could be worsening youngsters’ mental health. Yet legislative proposals have languished as tech and digital rights groups lobby against them, characterizing many of the measures as ineffective and dangerous for user privacy and safety.\n\n“Why has it taken so long? Because Big Tech companies have an army of lobbyists and lawyers who have fought us every step of the way,” Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican on the committee, said ahead of the hearing.\n\nBlackburn, along with Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, has championed a bill that would create legal requirements for tech companies to keep children safe from content that promotes violence, sexual exploitation, substance abuse, and eating disorders.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters There’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena Elon Musk’s Neuralink Performs Its First Human Implant AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Meta Platforms, Inc. META may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because Meta Platforms is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for META in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $4.86 per share for META, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.83 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for META, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.79% heading into earnings season.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Meta Platforms, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Microsoft, Google, and AMD's stocks are getting hit after big quarters",
        "content": "When you are a stock priced for greatness but only deliver a super good earnings report...sometimes investors will get in a huff.\n\nSuch is the case with the initial crop of earnings from tech behemoths Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). The three stocks (with a combined market cap of $5.2 trillion) were instrumental in powering the broader market to records over the past year, but are getting dinged after reporting earnings late Tuesday.\n\nThe moves are \"signaling some overextension of the recent strong rally,\" said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance.\n\nAt first glance, the negative moves in the stock prices would seem counterintuitive to the average investor who have ridden these tech giants to massive paper gains.\n\nBut here is the deal, as President Biden would put it.\n\nThat average investor probably read the earnings releases of these bellwether companies last night. I’ll say a good percentage of them listened to the earnings calls (which you should be doing!).\n\nBy 7:00pm last night, with a full page of notes, many investors still can’t figure out why these stocks are being swept into downdrafts.\n\nAll three companies showed impressive growth numbers (especially AMD, with data center sales up 38% year over year and a 75% hike to 2024 AI chip sales estimates), hyped the AI train again (a surefire ticket for stock gains last year), and didn’t sound serious alarm bells on the economy.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nThe reality is that none of these quarters were perfect, versus investor expectations of perfection. And believe me, investors have priced in perfection to these stocks: according to Yahoo Finance data, these three stocks trade on an average forward P/E multiple of 35 times. The S&P 500 trades at 22 times, for perspective.\n\nThe vibe coming off these earnings, according to sources, is that growth is good because of the expansion of new AI tools and other businesses, but not mind-blowingly good.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s results unearthed some caution on the economy, pros say.\n\n\"While Microsoft’s F2Q24 top-line results for the two most important businesses (Azure and Office 365 Commercial) were in line to a little better than consensus expectations (and guidance), they were a bit below what our Plausible scenario anticipated, indicating slightly moderating business momentum,\" Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci wrote in a note to clients. FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is seen on the Google house at CES 2024, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 10, 2024. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nGoogle missed estimates for its ad revenue (from Search and Youtube), and its cloud business didn't light it up versus larger rival in Microsoft's Azure.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill noted on Alphabet: \"Strong ad demand drove accelerating, double-digit growth in Search and YouTube, though shy of some investor bogeys. Cloud growth re-accelerated, but remains below Azure.\"\n\nAs for AMD, its gaming chip sales fell 17% from the year prior, and guidance didn't wow the investing masses.\n\n\"This knee-jerk reaction [to tech results] is noise, the AI revolution has started,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me via email.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nBut all in, Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and other members of the Magnificent 7 will have to do better than Microsoft, AMD, and Alphabet to impress investors demanding excellence paired with a side of perfection.\n\nIf they don't, 2024 may go down as the year of the Unmagnificent 7.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Insiders At Meta Platforms Sold US$13m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "In the last year, many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Financial Officer, Susan J. Li, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$306 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$400. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 11% of Susan J. Li's stake.\n\nIn the last year Meta Platforms insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nInsiders At Meta Platforms Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. In total, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth sold US$2.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, currently worth about US$140b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Meta Platforms Tell Us?\n\nAn insider sold Meta Platforms shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Meta Platforms has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "We're In a New Bull Market. Here Are 5 Brilliant Stocks I'm Buying Hand Over Fist.",
        "content": "As the new bull market kicks off, many investors might wonder which stocks to buy. After all, it's only \"officially\" declared a new bull market once the market reaches new all-time highs. As a result, many stocks are expensive, but not every stock is that way.\n\nI've got five that still look like solid buys right now, and I think investors would be wise to snag this group while they're still fairly valued.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a wide-ranging company. It has multiple AI investments, a cloud computing division (Google Cloud), and other properties like YouTube. But at the end of the day, Alphabet is primarily an advertising company. With nearly 80% of its revenue coming from ads, the ad market must stay strong.\n\nIt showed signs of strength in the third quarter, with ad revenue rising 9.5% -- a significant improvement compared to recent quarters. Advertising market strength is expected to persist throughout the year as the economy shrugs off recession expectations.\n\nThis is part of why analysts expect 11% revenue growth and 26% earnings growth in 2024. As a result, the stock trades for a reasonable 23 times forward earnings (reasonable, at least when compared to other big-tech stocks).\n\nAlphabet's main business is in recovery mode, and with the upside of AI, it could be a strong year for the third-largest company in the U.S. markets.\n\n2. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) was supposed to be ruined by a recession in 2023 or 2024. However, that hasn't happened, and the company has continued to deliver strong results. In Q3, revenue rose 18% to $3.4 billion and produced an impressive $1.3 billion in free cash flow. With nights and experiences rising 14% year over year, it's clear that Airbnb is still a popular choice when traveling.\n\nWith fourth-quarter revenue expected to grow around 13%, it should be another strong quarter when Airbnb reports results. Despite that, Airbnb trades at a fairly cheap price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio when 2024 results are used. Wall Street analysts expect earnings per share of around $8.07 in 2024, pricing the stock at 18 times forward earnings. Considering the S&P 500 trades for a forward P/E of around 20, Airbnb stock looks like a bargain.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. UiPath\n\nUiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a bit of an artificial intelligence (AI) play, as its robotic process automation (RPA) software uses AI to broaden what it can automate. However, it doesn't come with the price tag you'd expect from an AI-related company. UiPath trades for under 11 times sales -- a reasonable level that would still make sense even if it was fully profitable (Airbnb trades at 10 times sales).\n\nUiPath is rapidly growing, too, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) rising 24% year over year to $1.38 billion. While it's nowhere near profitable, it has enacted several improvements to increase its operating efficiencies in pursuit of breaking even. PATH Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\nUiPath provides this group with rapid growth without needing to overpay for it.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is also heavily exposed to the advertising industry. While it has other investments in mixed and virtual reality, the metaverse, and AI, Meta's primary revenue stream comes from its Family of Apps, consisting of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Threads.\n\nAd revenue struggled in late 2022 and into 2023 but dramatically recovered in Q3 by rising 24% year over year. Thanks to this massive revenue boost and operating expenses decreasing, Meta's earnings per share (EPS) shot up from $1.64 to $4.50.\n\nIf it can keep this up throughout 2024, the stock will look dramatically undervalued. With a forward P/E ratio of 22, it still looks like a strong buy at these prices.\n\n5. Visa\n\nLast is Visa(NYSE: V), which recently reported its most recent earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 31). While Visa's revenue growth didn't reach double digits (it grew 9%), its stock buyback program and operational improvements allowed its EPS to increase by an outstanding 20%.\n\nThese results allowed Visa to notch a new all-time high stock price. However, the stock still isn't that expensive. V PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the past decade, you could rarely buy Visa's stock for under 30 times earnings. However, with strong expected earnings growth this year, Visa is hovering around some of the cheapest available levels in recent history. As a result, it's a strong buy in today's markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nevada files lawsuit against Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Snapchat and TikTok: 'Hazard to public health'",
        "content": "The state of Nevada is suing some of the most popular social media companies, alleging that their apps are intentionally addictive and have contributed to a decline in mental health for its users, especially teens and young adults.\n\nNevada Attorney General Aaron Ford filed civil lawsuits Tuesday against the parent companies of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Snapchat and TikTok apps, claiming they are a \"hazard to public health\" and that they use \"false, deceptive and unfair marketing\" to directly appeal to youth. The lawsuit also says the respective apps’ algorithms are \"designed deliberately to addict young minds and prey on teenagers’ well-understood vulnerabilities.\"\n\n\"All of these platforms use features like endless scrolling, dopamine-inducing rewards, disappearing content, likes, shares, push notifications, and other elements to maximize youth use, manipulate young emotions, and exploit children’s developing minds — all for massive financial gain,\" the attorney general’s office alleged in a news release, announcing the lawsuits. \"Each of these platforms has also been linked to serious dangers to kids, including auto accidents, increases in drug overdoses, suicides, eating disorders, sexual exploitation and more.\"\n\n\"My commitment to protecting consumers, particularly those that are as vulnerable as our youth, is unwavering. Bringing this litigation is an important step toward ensuring social media platforms put our children’s safety before their profits,\" Ford, a Democrat, said Tuesday.\n\nFACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM ACCUSED OF ALLOWING PREDATORS TO SHARE TIPS WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT VICTIMIZING CHILDREN Ford alleges in the filing that these apps can potentially be more hazardous to mental health than even some drugs as the apps lack a natural breakpoint where the content runs out.\n\nFord, alongside private law firms, filed the civil suit in Clark County District Court.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nAt the root of the filing is what is commonly known about these social media apps: companies make money by advertising on the apps, so they utilize aggressive algorithms to capture and keep users on the apps longer, so the companies can make more revenue via the ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne result of addictive content is \"doom-scrolling,\" or when users spend more time than intended to see what new content the algorithm provides. These apps often prioritize engaging content, such as short videos, that have produced lots of reactions. This keeps the users in a pattern of gaining quick satisfaction before moving into the next one, and the next one.\n\nMETA IS ‘NEW TOBACCO’ AFTER STATES SUE OVER ALTERED REALITIES FOR KIDS, LEGAL GURU SAYS: ‘ELECTRONIC MORPHINE’\n\nFord alleges in the filing that these apps can potentially be more hazardous to mental health than even some drugs as the apps are ceaseless. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford speaks about 2024 election security at the Clark County Election Department on Jan. 10, 2024, in North Las Vegas.\n\nWhile physical drugs have a natural break point to their usage, the social media apps do not. A user \"can spend an infinite amount of their time\" on the apps and can become trapped in \"a bottomless pit\" as the content flows endlessly onto their devices, the lawsuit alleges. This endlessness exacerbates the addiction and its subsequent effects such as problematic internet usage, mental health, body image, physical health and online security.\n\nAnd, children are disproportionately impacted.\n\nDOZENS OF STATES SUE META OVER SOCIAL MEDIA 'PROFOUNDLY ALTERED' MENTAL, SOCIAL REALITIES OF AMERICAN YOUTH\n\nWhile the apps each feature age-limits, requiring users to be at least 13 years old or older, children can easily navigate the apps and create accounts to access the content.\n\n\"In effect, the Defendants are conducting a potentially society-altering experiment on a generation of Young Users’ developing brains,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"While this experiment’s full impact may not be realized for decades, the early returns are alarming.\" While these popular socia media apps each feature age-limits, requiring users to be at least 13 years old or older, children can easily create new accounts.\n\nIn a statement to FOX Business, a Meta spokesperson said the lawsuit \"mischaracterizes\" the work that the company does to ensure users' safety, especially teens.\n\n\"The complaint mischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents,\" the statement read. \"We want teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online, and we have over 30 tools to support them and their parents. We’ve spent a decade working on these issues and hiring people who have dedicated their careers to keeping young people safe and supported online.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Meta announced it would be implementing new protections \"that are focused on the types of content teens see on Instagram and Facebook.\"\n\nThese changes include \"hiding more types of content for teens on Instagram and Facebook, in line with expert guidance,\" the Facebook-parent company said.\n\n\"We regularly consult with experts in adolescent development, psychology and mental health to help make our platforms safe and age-appropriate for young people, including improving our understanding of which types of content may be less appropriate for teens.\" it added.\n\nFOX Business reached out to Snap but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nOriginal article source:Nevada files lawsuit against Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Snapchat and TikTok: 'Hazard to public health'",

        "content": "Every new technology has a range of outcomes. Some, like the internet, change the world. Others, like 3D printing, not so much, at least not yet. Artificial intelligence (AI) has gotten a lot of hype, but it seems to have the backing of businesses and governments needed to make a tremendous impact over the coming years.\n\nAI could create fantastic new companies over time, but a handful of AI stocks are already racing to the front. These four stocks below have already benefited from an AI boost and still trade at great prices.\n\nPay attention to what their valuation is versus their expected growth. If you can divide the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio by the expected growth rate and get under 1.5, the stock could be a reasonable price for the growth you could get. This number, called the PEG ratio, is a Peter Lynch favorite.\n\nGrowth on sale is an excellent recipe for total returns, so these could be the top-performing AI stocks by 2030.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nThe U.S. government will be a massive factor in AI because the technology could become a competitive advantage against the world's other countries. Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is uniquely positioned as a software company with deep government ties. The U.S. government is over half of Palantir's revenue. Its software platforms are like an operating system for organizations, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze and use data. PLTR EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nThe company recently began posting a consistent generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, and analysts believe that earnings will continue snowballing, calling for an annual average of 72% over the long term. At just 55 times forward earnings, that leaves much room for investment returns over the rest of this decade.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nAI requires massive computing power to process vast amounts of data quickly. Chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stepped into the leadership role last year as companies frantically began spending to build these advanced computer systems. Nvidia's business (and stock) took off last year, and the company's now sitting on an estimated 90% of the AI chip market.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nNaturally, Nvidia could continue proliferating from AI's growth alone even if competitors nibble away at Nvidia's dominance. Despite the stock multiplying in value over the past year, the company's strong earnings-growth outlook makes the stock very reasonable on a forward basis. In other words, growth should carry shares higher over the coming years.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nWhat do you get when you combine one of the world's most dominating business models with AI upside? It might be social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta makes billions of dollars by advertising to its 3.96 billion monthly app users. Additionally, still-young CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has leaned heavily into building AI technology that enhances its advertising business and is a long-term wildcard. META EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nThe company hit some speed bumps in 2022 but has since rallied over 300% from its lows. Remarkably, the company's 20% estimated long-term growth rate makes its current valuation arguably a bargain for long-term investors. Given its dominance in social media, investors can hold Meta as an AI stock with a higher floor than most.\n\n4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nWhile you shouldn't assume that Nvidia will fall out of the AI chip lead, there is a reasonable chance that AI will be so big that more than one chip company can win. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) might be the next-best bet after Nvidia. The company hasn't yet felt the growth spurt that Nvidia has, but it revealed an upcoming AI chip line in late 2023 that it says will outperform Nvidia's popular H100 series. AMD EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nAMD may have to prove itself by showing the sales to back up its claims, but analysts seem optimistic about the company's broader prospects. Long-term growth estimates are over 35%, which makes the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 44 a solid price to pay for that growth. This stock may carry more risk, but the potential upside could surprise investors if AMD can make more progress in taking AI chip market share than Wall Street is giving it credit for.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

        "content": "By David Shepardson and Makini Brice\n\nWASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The chief executives of social media companies Meta, X, TikTok, Snap, and Discord will face tough questions Wednesday on efforts to combat online child sexual exploitation at a U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman, said some tech firms had made some recent changes to protect children from online predators but had not done enough. \"It's clear that we need legislation because the tech industry has failed on its own to protect our kids. They're protecting their profits, but they're not protecting our children,\" Durbin said Tuesday.\n\nIt will be the first appearance by TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew before U.S. lawmakers since March when the Chinese-owned short video app company faced harsh questions, including some suggesting the app was damaging children's mental health.\n\n\"We make careful product design choices to help make our app inhospitable to those seeking to harm teens,\" Chew's written testimony says, adding TikTok's community guidelines strictly prohibit anything that puts \"teenagers at risk of exploitation or other harm -- and we vigorously enforce them.\"\n\nChew disclosed more than 170 million Americans used TikTok monthly -- 20 million more than the company said last year.\n\nDurbin said the platforms are being used by offenders to target children or trade child sexual abuse material.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, X CEO Linda Yaccarino, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Discord CEO Jason Citron will testify.\n\n\"We’re committed to protecting young people from abuse on our services, but this is an ongoing challenge,\" Zuckerberg's written testimony says. \"As we improve defenses in one area, criminals shift their tactics, and we have to come up with new responses.\"\n\nSpeigel said Snap's parental controls resemble \"how we believe parents monitor their teens activity in the real world – where parents want to know who their teens are spending time with but don’t need to listen in on every private conversation.\"\n\nThe committee last year approved several bills including one that would remove tech firms' immunity from civil and criminal liability under child sexual abuse material laws that was first proposed in 2020. None have become law.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar told Reuters it is time for legislative action. \"For too long social media companies have turned a blind eye when young children joined the platforms, increased the risk of sexual exploitation, used algorithms that push harmful content, and provided a venue for dealers to sell deadly drugs like fentanyl,” she said.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.

He’ll ask lawmakers to pursue legislation that implements a system for age verification and parental controls, and advocate for industry standards for age-appropriate content.\n\n“Teens do amazing things on our services,” Zuckerberg is expected to say, according to prepared testimony shared with the committee. “They use our apps to feel more connected, informed and entertained, as well as to express themselves, create things, and explore their interests. Overall, teens tell us this is a positive part of their lives.”\n\nZuckerberg also will emphasize Meta’s investments in child safety, and willingness to work alongside parents and lawmakers. The company has about 40,000 people currently working on safety and security, and has spent more than $20 billion on those efforts since 2016, according to the remarks.\n\n“We want teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences on our apps, and we want to help parents manage those experiences,” Zuckerberg’s statement reads. “That’s why in the last 8 years we’ve introduced more than 30 different tools, resources, and features to help parents and teens.”\n\nThe Senate hearing, which is focused on child safety online, also includes the leaders of ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, X, Discord Inc. and Snap Inc. and will be available to watch here.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to his own prepared remarks, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel plans to focus on work his Snapchat app has done to combat potential extortion, distribution of child sexual abuse material and illicit drugs.\n\nRead More: Tech CEOs Brace for Senate Spotlight on Children’s Safety: What to Expect\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena Elon Musk’s Neuralink Performs Its First Human Implant AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most profitable blue chip stocks to buy. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, the outlook for 2024, and some recent and crucial developments, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Buy.\n\nWith the first month of 2024 coming to an end, the conflict in the Middle East appears to be a sore thumb in an otherwise roaring stock market and economic climate. While the Federal Reserve can take longer to reduce interest rates, as investors have likely understood during the past couple of weeks, the economy continues to grow and inflation is nowhere near the levels that were in play in late 2022. 2023 has seen a stock market compete with high interest and get some help from the economy along the way as global oil supply chains stabilized and prices at the pump dropped as a result.\n\nHowever, the war in Palestine and the resulting destabilization in the Middle East threatens a vulnerable global economy that has finally started to find some footing after 2022's oil price shocks and high interest rates aimed at culling inflation. In the Middle East, three U.S. service members were killed and dozens were injured due to an unmanned drone attack on a base in northeast Jordan. With the political temperature already high domestically, and conflict rife in Gaza, Lebanon, and Ukraine, the U.S.'s response has everyone on the edge of their seats even though the attack took place on a weekend. The Federal Reserve is also a key body to watch as the year starts, as the tone set by its officials during their January announcements will dictate how well growth and high technology sectors can grow.\n\nThe start of the year is also the time for recollection, and for some investors, the time to adjust portfolios. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite gained 24% and 43% respectively last year, allowing the passive investor following index tracking funds a nice gain to cash out on as the year ended. Now, the question on everyone's mind is whether the markets will sustain their 2023 performance or become even bolder to set new highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst these considerations, there are a multitude of stocks that an investor can choose from. The market is often divided across several categories and sectors, and one of these picks out stocks based on their market capitalization. A market cap sets the tone for a firm in the public's mind, as more valuable companies see both retail and professional investors place a higher premium on a firm's shares. This premium is mostly reflected through fortress income statements that reflect billions (if not hundreds or tens of billions) of dollars in revenue and substantial assets that assure investors that the ability of a company to remain a going concern is not threatened even during some of the most troubling economic environments.\n\nOn the flip side, other stocks such as small cap stocks often do well when the economy is growing since it provides them with the potential to expand operations and increase sales. Balancing a portfolio often requires subjective judgment, and in today's highly connected and fast paced world, a keen monitoring of local and global events to see whether markets as a whole will remain stable or not.\n\nToday, we'll take a look at some of the most profitable blue chip stocks right now. Profit is an important indicator of a stock's financial health since it measures the money that is available for growth reinvesting, retained capital, or dividends if the company is a dividend paying stock. It also shows that financial managers have managed to manage debt and expenses to ensure investor payouts, and provides an analyst comfort that a firm should be able to handle any economic or market headwinds.\n\nSome of the most profitable blue chip stocks on our list are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).

        "content": "What To Expect From Meta’s (META) Q4 Earnings\n\nSocial network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) will be reporting earnings tomorrow afternoon. Here's what you need to know.\n\nLast quarter Meta reported revenues of $34.15 billion, up 23.2% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 2%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter. On the other hand, Meta beat analysts' revenue and EPS estimates during the quarter, driven by better-than-expected monthly active user growth. The company reported 3.96 billion monthly active users, up 6.7% year on year.\n\nIs Meta buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Meta's revenue to grow 21.8% year on year to $39.17 billion, improving on the 4.5% year-over-year decline in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $4.97 per share. Meta Total Revenue\n\nThe analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bullish about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing fifteen upward revisions over the last thirty days. The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Meta's peers in the consumer internet segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Netflix delivered top-line growth of 12.5% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 1.4% and Match Group reported revenues up 10.2% year on year, exceeding estimates by 0.6%. Netflix traded up 4.4% on the results, and Match was flat on the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Netflix's results here and Match Group's results here.\n\nInvestors in the consumer internet segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks down on average 0.7% over the last month. Meta is up 13.2% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $393.5, compared to share price of $392.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "content": "*\n\nDiscrimination 'IRL', deluge of abuse online\n\n*\n\nTeen suicide heightens calls for action by Meta\n\n*\n\nSocial media giants urged to do more\n\n*\n\nAdvocates blame weak content moderation\n\nBy Mehran Firdous and Shantasree Sarkar\n\nNEW DELHI, Jan 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The suicide of a 16-year-old Indian boy who hit a wall of online abuse after posting selfies in saris and makeup has galavanised calls for social media giants to better protect LGBTQ+ Indians.\n\nSexual minorities say it is hard enough being openly gay or transgender in India, and the pressure only mounts in the online world where advocates blame weak content moderation for an explosion in derogatory feedback.\n\n\"In India, the online abuse faced by LGBTQ+ creators, predominantly on Instagram, is pervasive and includes death threats, hate speech, rape threats, bullying and other forms of harassment,\" said Jeet, founder of Yes, We Exist, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group on Instagram.\n\nThe widespread abuse significantly impacts the mental health of LGBTQ+ people, leading some to self-censor, limit online activities or, in rare cases, consider self-harm, said Jeet, who goes by one name.\n\nWhile legal protections exist, investigation of complaints is slow and convictions for abuse are scarce, he added.\n\nEven if companies such as Instagram have strongly worded policies on hate speech, LGBTQ+ advocates say that parent company Meta falls short on enforcement, raising questions about its commitment to minority protection.\n\n\"Meta claims to have experienced content moderators who review content in multiple Indian languages, it invests heavily in improving existing systems and processes, and it is committed to keeping all users safe,\" said Jeet.\n\n\"However, these words and commitment seem hollow to queer users on Instagram.\"\n\nThe suicide in November of 16-year-old Priyanshu Yadav, who posted makeup and skincare tutorials, has sharpened the focus, with social media firms under mounting pressure to better safeguard their users from verbal abuse and physical threats.\n\nStory continues\n\nYadav dreamt of being a teen influencer - he had amassed about 17,000 followers on Instagram while alive, a number that has since doubled - but the barrage of homophobic cyberbullying his posts provoked may have got too much, according to LGBTQ+ online content creators and campaigners.\n\nPolice have neither issued comment nor revealed the cause of Yadav's suicide, saying it was still under investigation, while his mother voiced concern in local media about the online abuse her son had faced.\n\nCYBERBULLYING ON THE RISE\n\nYadav is not alone in facing a severe online backlash.\n\nNon-binary lawyer Reyansh Naarang, who identifies as neither male nor female and uses they/them pronouns, said abuse of minorities was both rife and rising in the fast-paced social-media world.\n\n\"It is extremely painful when people refer to us negatively and mistreat us in any way online as it not only causes mental distress but also forces us to give up our digital footprint,\" Naarang told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nIn a bid to keep the bullies at bay, Naarang took the decision to turn their public Instagram account private in 2022.\n\nIt helped - but was far from a panacea given that platforms show \"zero tolerance for the LGBTQ+ way of life\" and the government, too, fails to protect minorities, the lawyer said.\n\n\"Our bodies are framed as primary targets for harassment and are policed - both offline and online.\"\n\nThe federal government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMeta would not talk to individual cases but said it partners with LGBTQ+ safety and advocacy groups around the world to design policies and tools that make its environment safer.\n\n\"This approach is always evolving, and input from the LGBTQ+ community online is critical to informing and continuously improving Meta's technologies and programs,\" a Meta spokesperson said in emailed comments.\n\n\"We recognize the importance of having a safe place to connect online.\"\n\nMeta also has policies in place to protect LGBTQ+ people from harmful content, including hate speech, bullying and harassment, and non-consensually shared intimate imagery.\n\n\"We recognize that bullying and harassment can have even more of an emotional and physical impact on minors, which is why our policies provide even deeper protections for young people,\" Meta's LGBTQ+ safety policies page says.\n\nAdvocates say the need for better protection online has never been so urgent, with a 25% rise in cyberstalking and cyberbullying in 2022 against the previous year, according to government data released last month.\n\nCases of online abetment to suicide also rose from 10 in 2021 to 24 in 2022.\n\nMinorities often bear the brunt of bullying, experts said.\n\nAll five major social media platforms – Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter) – received low and failing scores on an LGBTQ+ social media safety index in 2023 by media advocacy group GLAAD.\n\nIt found Twitter to be the most dangerous for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nNaarang said LGBTQ+ Indians also face routine discrimination in daily life, risking police harassment, extortion and abuse, despite a slew of reforms implemented once gay sex was decriminalised in India in 2018.\n\nThe police did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMETA URGED TO ACT\n\nYadav's suicide prompted LGBTQ+ rights campaigners to call on Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, to crack down on cyberbullying across its sites.\n\nThe suicide led to an online petition - started by LGBTQ+ artist Roshni Kumar - calling on \"Meta India to change guidelines to protect queer individuals\".\n\nSince its launch in late November, the petition has garnered nearly 3,000 signatures but \"Meta hasn't shown any desire to deal with the problem\", Kumar said.\n\nNishitha Berry, who says she is attracted to people of all gender identities, creates videos about LGBTQ+ issues for YouTube and Instagram.\n\nShe takes issue with how Meta India handles Instagram content like hers, saying it failed to investigate her content properly before removing it, then threatened her with account closure due to the backlash her posts received.\n\nMeta did not respond to requests for comment on this.\n\nRaqeeb, a 30-year-old photographer who identifies as neither male nor female, said social media was a minefield where his work capturing the male body draws \"daily threats and harassment online\".\n\n\"There seems to be no space for an artist like me in India,\" Raqeeb said, recalling Hindi slights that were posted on his Instagram calling him \"chakka\" or \"meetha\" - slang for gay.\n\n\"Sadly, it takes the death of a member of our community to discuss online harassment,\" said Raqeeb.\n\nLEGAL PROTECTION\n\nSwar Thapa, a trans disc jockey, said she is often propositioned online as a prostitute - a common trans stereotype in India - and gets asked about her \"nightly rates\".\n\n\"Online platforms lack effective algorithms to filter out abusive messages when they are in Hindi as existing systems are primarily optimised for English,\" said Thapa, citing the example of the slur \"randi\" which means prostitute in Hindi.\n\nMeta did not provide comment on language moderation.\n\nMany say the problem is not helped by India's legal system.\n\nShivangi Sharma, a Supreme Court lawyer, said government efforts to address online harassment of LGBTQ+ Indians fall short as the country lacks wider laws protecting LGBTQ+ people.\n\nSharma pointed to Asian countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore and Sri Lanka that offer more protection.\n\nActivists said social media platforms should also implement a user-friendly \"safe mode\" to prevent people from tagging them or commenting on their posts.\n\nDigital rights expert Nikhil Pahwa said platforms could also enhance reporting and let users report mass targeting incidents.\n\n\"Individuals facing targeted abusive campaigns endure emotional distress, whether lasting for an hour, week or a month,\" said Pahwa.\n\n\"With a single click, users can activate this mode ... providing a quick and effective means of protection.\"\n\nHe said it was also crucial for platforms to employ reviewers who understand local languages and slang, ensuring they follow the nuances of different cultures and contexts.

        "content": "Sexual predators. Addictive features. Self-harm and eating disorders. Unrealistic beauty standards. Bullying. These are just some of the issues young people are dealing with on social media — and children's advocates and lawmakers say companies are not doing enough to protect them.\n\nOn Wednesday, the CEOs of Meta, TikTok, X and other social media companies are testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about child exploitation on their platforms, as lawmakers, families and advocates are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media on young people’s lives.\n\nWhile Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a veteran of congressional hearings since his first one over the Cambridge Analytica privacy debacle in 2018, it will only be the second time for TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and the first for Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Discord CEO Jason Citron are also scheduled to testify.\n\n“We understand that they are companies and they have to make profit. But when you’re faced with really important safety and privacy decisions, the revenue in the bottom line should not be the first factor that these companies are considering,\" said Zamaan Qureshi, co-chair of Design It For Us, a youth-led coalition advocating for safer social media. \"These companies have had opportunities to do this before they failed to do that. So independent regulation needs to step in.”\n\nMeta will likely be a central focus of the hearing, as the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant has been sued by dozens of states that say it knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms and failed to protect them from online predators.\n\nThe company has been beefing up its child safety features in recent weeks, announcing earlier this month that it will start hiding inappropriate content from teenagers’ accounts on Instagram and Facebook, including posts about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders. It also restricted minors' ability to receive messages from anyone they don’t follow or aren’t connected to on Instagram and on Messenger and added new “nudges” to try to discourage teens from browsing Instagram videos or messages late at night. The nudges encourage kids to close the app, though it does not force them to do so.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut critics and child safety advocates say its actions fall short of meaningful changes that would address kids' safety.\n\n“Looking back at each time there has been a Facebook or Instagram scandal in the last few years, they run the same playbook. Meta cherry picks their statistics and talks about features that don’t address the harms in question,” said Arturo Béjar, a former engineering director at the social media giant known for his expertise in curbing online harassment who recently testified before Congress about child safety on Meta's platforms.\n\n“Instagram promises features that end up hidden in settings that few people use. Why is ‘quiet mode’ not the default for all kids?” Béjar added. “Meta says that some of the new work will help with unwanted advances. It is still not possible for a teen to tell Instagram when they’re experiencing an unwanted advance. Without that information how can they make it safer?”\n\nX, formerly Twitter, said its CEO Linda Yaccarino was in Washington last week to meet with senators to talk about how the company is addressing child sexual exploitation, along with a broad range of other topics that included privacy, artificial intelligence, content moderation and misinformation.\n\n“As an entirely new company, X has strengthened its policies and enforcement to tackle CSE. We are now taking action on users that distribute this content and also taking immediate action on the networks of users who engage with this horrible content,” the company said in a blog post Friday.\n\nGoogle's YouTube is notably missing from the list of companies called to the Senate Wednesday. That's even though more kids use YouTube than any other platform, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew found that 93% of U.S. teens use YouTube, with TikTok a distant second at 63%.\n\n“The thing about YouTube is that it kind of flies under the radar,” said Larissa May, the founder and executive director of the nonprofit #HalfTheStory, which helps teens develop healthy relationships with technology. “I think Meta has gotten so used to taking so much of the heat for the issues that young people are facing. But it’s actually much, much bigger than that.”",

        "content": "It’s a highly critical week for earnings, with several mega-cap technology companies slated to reveal quarterly results.

        "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures experienced a downturn on Tuesday night following the release of quarterly results by two leading tech corporations Microsoft and Alphabet. Investors are also focusing on the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates.\n\nBy 6:40 pm ET (11:40 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures were little changed, S&P 500 Futures fell 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 Futures lost 0.9%.\n\nIn post-market trading, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell by 0.7% despite reporting EPS of $2.93 versus $2.78 expected, while revenues surpassed estimates, coming in at $62 billion versus $61.1 billion expected. However, less-than-anticipated growth in cloud services was also reported.\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) declined by 5.6% after reporting EPS of $1.64 versus $1.59 expected, while revenues came in at $86.31 billion versus $85.23 billion expected. Ad revenue, however, appeared to fall short of investor expectations. As a result, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) also experienced a decrease in stock value.\n\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) fell by 5.9% after reporting EPS of $0.77, in-line with expectations, while revenues were reported at $6.2 billion versus $6.13 billion expected.\n\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) gained 4.2% after the company reported EPS of $0.9 versus $0.94 expected, while revenues came in at $9.43 billion versus $9.62 billion expected. The coffee giant also reported a 5% increase in global comparable store sales.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) also fell by 3.5% after-hours, following a legal decision to nullify Elon Musk’s $55 billion pay package.\n\nTake advantage of InvestingPro this earnings season - Receive an additional 10% off on the Pro+ 2-year subscription using the promo code \"INVPRODEAL\".\n\nThe tech sector, which has been the driving force behind the market rally from 2023 into 2024, currently trades at a relatively high valuation of nearly 29 times its 2024 earnings. In light of this, investors will need to see an expansion in earnings for tech companies to sustain their high price-to-book levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis activity follows a mixed day for stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, adding 0.4%. The S&P 500 marginally declined by 0.1% while the NASDAQ Composite lost 0.8%.\n\nThe focus for traders on Wednesday will be the Fed's rate decision. The fed funds futures market has priced in a nearly 98% probability that the central bank will leave rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Investors will be seeking indications of shifts in the central bank's policy stance in its post-meeting statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks.\n\nIn terms of earnings, Dow member Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) is set to release its results on Wednesday before the bell, while chipmaker Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is scheduled to announce its quarterly earnings after the close.\n\nOn the bond markets, United States 10-Year rates were at 4.036%.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDow futures steady as tech giants report, Fed decision on tap\n\nStryker forecasts strong 2024 as uptick in surgeries lift demand for devices\n\nSamsung sees tech devices demand recovering in 2024 after record chip loss",

Congress has increasingly scrutinized social media platforms as growing evidence suggests that excessive use and the proliferation of harmful content may be damaging young people’s mental health.\n\nSeveral bipartisan proposals seek to hold tech companies accountable, strengthen protections for young users and stop children’s sexual exploitation online. Yet a myriad of tech trade groups and civil liberties organizations have criticized many of the proposed measures as flawed and counterproductive, arguing they would worsen online privacy and safety if advanced. A handful of social media companies, including TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance Ltd., and Meta, are facing lawsuits in California that claim the companies were negligent and ignored the potential harms their platforms created for teens.\n\nQuestions from elected officials rarely stay hyper focused on the topic at hand when tech CEOs visit Washington, especially during hearings related to online content moderation. It’s possible that Wednesday’s session will end up being wide-ranging. Here’s a look at who will be testifying from each company, and what they are likely to discuss. Read more: Meta, X, Tiktok Face Senators’ Scrutiny Over Kids’ Online Safety\n\nStory continues\n\nMark Zuckerberg — Meta\n\nMeta, which owns social networking apps Facebook and Instagram, has faced significant pushback over the years for its child safety practices. Investigations by whistleblowers, news organizations and academic researchers have found the company’s sites can harm the mental health of young users and connect networks of predators to child-sex content. In October, more than 30 states sued Meta, alleging its social media apps were feeding harmful content to youth. Meta had plans in 2021 to create a version of Instagram for kids under 13, but later scrapped those plans after pushback related to the impact of Instagram on teens’ mental health.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has testified extensively before Congress in the past but has recently steered away from policy issues, will focus on the company’s efforts to improve child safety. Earlier this month the company announced plans to tighten default messaging settings for teens on Instagram and Facebook, and to restrict teens from seeing age-inappropriate content. Meta has advertising policies that prohibit marketers from showing certain types of ads to teenagers, or targeting them based on certain factors, like gender or their on-network activity.\n\nLinda Yaccarino — X\n\nLinda Yaccarino will make her first appearance before Congress as X’s CEO, a role she took on last June. The former advertising boss at NBCUniversal, Yaccarino has spent her first eight months on the job trying to win back advertisers and convince skeptics that X’s owner, Elon Musk, still cares about policing the social network. Musk has spoken or tweeted several times about the importance of protecting children online, making it a key part of the company’s public campaign to regain user trust and approval.\n\nYaccarino was in Washington this week to meet senators ahead of Wednesday’s hearing and talk about the company’s efforts to fight content related to child sexual exploitation. During meetings, she also stressed that X is a completely different company than its predecessor, Twitter, and it’s likely she’ll try to further distance X from its former self during the hearing by highlighting differences in content policies or strategy. X announced over the weekend that it will build a new Trust and Safety center in Austin with employees focused primarily on combatting content related to child sexual exploitation. It’s also likely Yaccarino will face questions about the rise of AI-generated content, including explicit content, and its dissemination on X. Last week, explicit images generated to look like Taylor Swift circulated on X for hours before they were removed, garnering millions of views and raising questions about the platform’s ability to quickly moderate abusive and illegal posts.\n\nEvan Spiegel — Snap\n\nCEO Evan Spiegel oversees Snapchat, an app that’s popular with teens centered more on person-to-person messaging than posting publicly. But that hasn’t insulated it from criticism. Snap is facing a California lawsuit brought by families who allege their children died from overdoses after purchasing drugs through the app.\n\nIn 2022, Snap introduced a function that lets parents or caretakers see certain activity on their kid’s account and implement controls, for example over whether their child is allowed to engage with the company’s AI chatbot. Last year, the app also imposed a strike system for accounts that post content publicly to Stories or Spotlight that’s inappropriate for teens.\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s hearing, Snap was the first tech company to endorse the Kids Online Safety Act, opposing industry trade group NetChoice’s stance on the bill.\n\nShou Chew — TikTok\n\nCEO Shou Chew returns to Congress almost a year after his first solo testimony before the House. Then, he was questioned on child safety concerns around TikTok’s addictive nature, and content promoting eating disorders, drug sales and sexual exploitation. Chew, who faced a confrontational audience at that hearing, argued that these issues are not unique to TikTok.\n\nLast year, the company introduced a pre-set time limit of one hour for users under 18 before the app prompts for a passcode to continue watching. Users who say they are 13- to 15-years-old have private accounts by default and cannot send messages. Like other apps, TikTok has a dashboard that can share usage information with parents and caregivers.\n\nChew could also get questions on the company’s relationship with China via parent company ByteDance. Senators may also ask about recent hot-button issues unrelated to children, including perceived biases when it comes to conflicts like the Israel-Hamas war, as well as the proliferation of AI-generated videos.\n\nJason Citron — Discord\n\nOriginally a chat app for gamers, Discord has been implicated in several high-profile investigations involving child predation, extremism and even terrorism. Today, Discord is mainstream among millennials and Gen Z for day-to-day communication with friends and online acquaintances. In 2021, the company reported 150 million monthly active users and even explored an acquisition by Microsoft for $12 billion.\n\nWith its increased popularity comes high levels of abuse. Between 2021 and 2022, instances of child sexual exploitation on the platform increased nearly sixfold to 169,800, according to data from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. That’s 73% higher than X, although the increase is also due in part to better detection methods.\n\nCEO and co-founder Jason Citron will represent the company before the committee and discuss initiatives to protect children on the platform. That will likely include its new, open-source model for detecting novel child abuse and work with the cross-platform child safety organization Lantern. Late in 2023, Discord rolled out new features for teens and families to better control their online experience.\n\n--With assistance from Aisha Counts and Oma Seddiq.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer’s New $2 Billion Arena How to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly’s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Made Around $9.6 Million Per Hour Or $230.6 Million Per Day In 2023 — His Major Investments Include A 30-Bedroom/Bathroom Compound And Beer-Drinking Wagyu Cattle",
        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg significantly increased his wealth in 2023, adding $84 billion to his net worth, as reported by Business Insider. As of January 2024, he is the fifth-richest person in the world with a net worth of $139.1 billion, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaire's List.\n\nAn increase of $84 billion in one year translates to an estimated $9.6 billion per hour or approximately $230.6 million each day. For context, the median net worth for U.S. families is around $192,900, while the average is about $1.06 million.\n\nIn 2021, Facebook’s rebrand to Meta was a strategic move signaling a pivot toward the metaverse. This transition was not just a name change. It also represented a shift in the company’s focus to a future involving shared virtual spaces, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies. The rebrand aimed to position Facebook as more than a social media platform and marked its entry into creating an interconnected digital world​​.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%. Ken Griffin says Miami will take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $100 before that happens.\n\nThe rebrand, however, came at a time when Facebook was facing a series of challenges, including controversies over handling misinformation, mental health issues and user retention. Experts and analysts observed that while rebranding to Meta was a significant step, it would not immediately resolve these ongoing issues. The move was also seen as a strategic distraction from the company’s internal and external problems, reminiscent of corporate rebrands in the past where companies sought to change public perception amid crises​​.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these challenges, by 2023, Meta’s share price had rebounded, nearing its all-time high. This recovery in stock value significantly boosted Zuckerberg’s net worth, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s long-term vision for the metaverse.\n\nDespite his preference for T-shirts and lack of interest in flashy accessories like expensive watches, Zuckerberg has made significant investments in expanding his real estate portfolio. He recently made headlines for his luxurious and secretive compound in Kauai, Hawaii. The compound, known as Koolau Ranch, spans over 1,400 acres and features an array of high-end amenities and security measures. The project is estimated to have cost around $270 million, including $100 million for construction and $170 million for land acquisition​​​​​​.\n\nThe Koolau Ranch compound is designed to be a self-sustaining oasis, complete with a 5,000-square-foot underground shelter that houses its own energy and food supplies. This bunker is equipped with a concrete-filled metal door and is connected to the main residences via a tunnel. The compound also includes over 30 bedrooms and bathrooms, two mansions, nearly a dozen tree houses linked by rope bridges, a fitness center and guest houses​.\n\nZuckerberg’s real estate ventures have consistently attracted attention, with his Hawaiian compound being the latest example. However, this isn’t his first foray into noteworthy property investments. In 2014, Zuckerberg’s second home, a renovation project in San Francisco’s Dolores Heights neighborhood, sparked tension among residents.\n\nAccording to The San Francisco Chronicle, extensive construction activities, including the installation of kitchen equipment and fiber-optic cables, led to significant disruptions. The project saw a substantial number of workers on site, with estimates of 40 to 50 people working daily since April 2013. The scale and nature of the renovations led one neighbor to describe the residence as “nothing short of a fortress.\" He sold the home in 2022 for $31 million.\n\nIn addition to the compound, Zuckerberg has also delved into high-end cattle farming on his Hawaiian property. He has invested in raising Wagyu and Angus cattle, which are fed a unique diet including beer and macadamia nuts, aiming to produce some of the highest quality beef in the world.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are 3 high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Anthony Quintano on Flickr\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Mark Zuckerberg Made Around $9.6 Million Per Hour Or $230.6 Million Per Day In 2023 — His Major Investments Include A 30-Bedroom/Bathroom Compound And Beer-Drinking Wagyu Cattle originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (META) to Report Q4 Earnings: What to Expect",
        "content": "Meta Platforms META is set to report its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 1.\r\n\r\nThe company expects total revenues between $36.5 billion and $40 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023. Favorable forex is expected to aid year-over-year top-line growth by roughly 2%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $38.93 billion, indicating an increase of 21.02% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings stands at $4.84 per share, which has increased 0.83% over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 61.33% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nMeta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 27.5%.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nMeta’s fourth-quarter top line is expected to have benefited from Facebook’s expanding user base (more than 3.049 billion daily active users) and growing adoption of reels. Increased engagement for Meta’s offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nEffective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nReels have been a major growth driver for Instagram. The company stated that Reels has driven a more than 40% increase in time spent on Instagram since its launch. It remains focused on growing Reels as part of its overall portfolio of video services, which make up more than half of time spent on Facebook and Instagram.\r\n\r\nHigher engagement levels are helping to steady its user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific Daily Active Users (DAUs) in the fourth quarter is pegged at 906 million, indicating 6.1% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for the Rest of World is expected to have increased 5.8% to 680 million DAUs.\r\n\r\nRegarding Monthly Active Users (MAUs), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific is pegged at 1.361 billion, suggesting 2.9% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for the Rest of World is expected to have risen 3.7% to 1.361 billion MAUs.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta’s worldwide DAU is pegged at 2.093 billion, indicating 4.7% growth year over year. The consensus estimate for worldwide MAU is pegged at 3.061 billion, indicating a 3.3% year-over-year increase.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Meta’s top line is expected to reflect the negative impact of the challenging macroeconomic environment and high inflation that is anticipated to have kept ad spending budgets under pressure. This is likely to have weighed on ad revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Meta’s ad revenues represented 99.1% of total revenues, which increased 23.5% year over year to $33.64 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2023 ad revenues is pegged at $37.88 billion, indicating 21.2% year-over-year growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is the exact case here.\r\n\r\nMeta has an Earnings ESP of +0.51% and currently has a Zacks Rank #2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nHere are a few other companies worth considering, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases:\r\n\r\nShopify SHOP has an Earnings ESP of +1.02% and a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels and Llama 2, is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta's advertising revenues, along with targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple's iOS changes. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+25.4% vs. +21.4%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\r\n\r\nContinued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\r\n\r\nHowever, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the underwriting results. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind.

This outlook reflects Costco's ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.\r\n\r\nA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Costco Wholesale here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Comcast Corp. and PACCAR Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "content": "The fourth-quarter 2023 earnings season has so far shown stability, mostly in line with expectations. As of Jan 26, 124 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their financial numbers. Total earnings for these 52 index members are down 0.4% from the same period last year on 3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt present, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index in fourth-quarter 2024 are expected to be up 1.1% on 2.4% higher revenues. This follows the 3.8% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues in the third quarter and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings before that.\n\nMeanwhile, several technology companies are slated to declare their quarterly financial numbers within the next seven days. A handful of those stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are poised to beat on earnings results. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful in the near-term.\n\nTechnology Sector in Q4\n\nThe explosion of artificial intelligence (AI) in both production processes and final products has created tremendous opportunities for the overall technology space. The tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI.\n\nThe data-centric computing architecture, especially, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the metaverse, has expanded the horizon for the technology sector. The pandemic-led social transformation has established digitization as the new normal. The outbreak of coronavirus quickly changed the lifestyle and outlook of people.\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five technology stocks that are poised to beat on earnings results in the next seven days. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings release. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the last quarter.

META is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking.\n\nHowever, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in the emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world’s second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for META. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for META.\n\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.51%.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nOn January 30, Asian stock markets experienced a decline, with China bearing the brunt of the downturn, amid growing concerns among investors. This pessimism in the market is putting pressure on policymakers in China to consider implementing rate cuts in order to stimulate economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Specifically, stock prices in Hong Kong saw a drop of approximately 2%, while mainland China stocks were on track for a third consecutive day of decline. The recent liquidation order issued against China Evergrande Group on Monday intensified market anxieties, leading to a notable 4% decrease in a Bloomberg index tracking Chinese developers. The Evergrande liquidation saga has cast a shadow over both the Chinese and Hong Kong markets, prompting investors to reassess their positions and adopt a cautious approach. This development underscores the significant influence that regulatory and economic factors in China can have on global financial markets. As market sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty looms, investors are closely monitoring the situation and its potential implications for broader market dynamics. The possibility of rate cuts by Chinese policymakers is being closely watched as investors seek clues about the future direction of economic policy and its impact on market stability.\n\nThe oil market remained stable as investors awaited the United States' response to the recent deadly attack on American troops in Jordan, reported Bloomberg. This attack has the potential to escalate tensions in a region crucial to global crude production. Brent crude futures were trading above $82 per barrel following a 1.4% decline on Monday, despite the drone strike targeting US soldiers. Iran has attempted to distance itself from the attack. Additionally, data indicating that OPEC+ is making a sluggish start to implementing new output cuts contributed to downward pressure on oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also showed little movement amidst the uncertainty. Oil traders are closely monitoring developments, particularly any indications of the US government's response to the attack. There are concerns that any action taken by the US could further heighten tensions in the region, potentially impacting oil supply and prices. As a result, market participants are proceeding cautiously, awaiting clarity on the situation and its potential implications for the oil market.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets. Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\nWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\n10. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nOn January 29, Barclays analyst Mario Lu reiterated his Underweight rating on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) while adjusting the price target upwards from $100 to $110. This decision comes amidst ongoing scrutiny and cautious sentiment regarding the company's performance and valuation. Despite the upward revision in the price target, Lu maintains a conservative stance on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) outlook, suggesting that the stock may not offer significant upside potential in the near term. The decision to maintain the Underweight rating indicates Barclays' skepticism about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) ability to justify its current valuation. The revised price target of $110 suggests that Barclays anticipates limited growth prospects for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), especially considering the prevailing market conditions and the company's financial performance. While the price target raise acknowledges certain positive factors, such as the company's strong brand recognition and market presence, it also underscores the cautious approach taken by analysts like Lu. As of the closing bell on January 29, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock was trading at $152.70, reflecting the market's reaction to the revised price target and Barclays' assessment of the company's valuation.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were Illumina, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Microsoft. Airbnb continues to deliver double-digit growth in revenue and nights booked, which is especially impressive given the year-ago growth rates it delivered on these same metrics (+29% and +31, respectively). Despite these attractive results, the stock sold off as investors reacted to fourth quarter guidance that came in slightly below expectations. Coming into the fourth quarter, the stock was up +60% on the back of strong fundamentals. Stepping back, nothing has changed. Private rentals continue to take market share from hotels globally, and Airbnb continues to take market share within private rentals given its relentless focus on improving the guest and host experience. Looking ahead, we expect many years of robust earnings and cash flow growth from here.”\n\n09. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nUpside Potential: 4%\n\nOn January 29, Baird analyst William Power increased the price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $186.00 to $200.00, affirming an Outperform rating. This adjustment reflects Baird's optimistic outlook on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) performance and potential within the technology sector. With a revised price target suggesting a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, the analyst's move indicates confidence in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ability to continue delivering value to investors. The decision to maintain the Outperform rating underscores Baird's belief in Apple's strong position in the industry and its ability to outperform market expectations. The raised price target of $200.00 reflects Baird's positive assessment of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth prospects, innovation pipeline, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was trading at $191.73, indicating a modest premium over the revised price target set by Baird.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. While on a total attribution basis, Apple was not a top three detractor to our full-year return, given its extremely large weighting in the Index, we feel it’s worth sharing our thoughts.\n\nThe company’s share price appreciated nearly 50% in a year when its revenue declined and earnings per share was relatively flat with the previous year.\n\nFor 2024, consensus expectations are for low-single-digit revenue growth and only slightly faster EPS growth. These pedestrian growth rates are not surprising for a company with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue. What is more surprising is that Apple shares trade at nearly 30x forward earnings, a large premium to the market and many faster-growing, competitively advantaged businesses.\n\nWhile we continue to think Apple is a wonderful business, it is also a slow growing one with risks that we do not see as insignificant. Apple’s entire supply chain is based in China and much of its incremental revenue growth also comes from China, so if there is a U.S.-China issue that makes it more difficult for U.S.-based companies that have access to large amounts of local data to operate in China, Apple’s business would likely face more challenges than many others. In addition, much of Apple’s services growth and margin expansion has come from direct payments from Google to be the default search provider on iOS devices. This practice is currently the subject of a lawsuit between Google and the U.S. Justice Department. If this practice is deemed unlawful, it could take away a large and highly profitable revenue stream from Apple’s already slow growth engine. While we closely cover Apple, we continue to believe we have better investment opportunities. Apple’s current P/E is above our Portfolio’s weighted average, yet its long-term earnings growth rate is likely to be lower than even our slowest growing holding, according to our research.”\n\n08. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nUpside Potential: 4%\n\nOn January 29, Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger increased the price target for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) from $610.00 to $678.00, upholding an Outperform rating. This adjustment underscores Oppenheimer's positive outlook on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) prospects within the software and financial technology industry. With the revised price target indicating a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, Schneeberger's move reflects confidence in Intuit's ability to deliver value to investors. Maintaining the Outperform rating signals Oppenheimer's belief in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) competitive positioning and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $678.00 reflects Oppenheimer's bullish stance on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) long-term growth prospects, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock was trading at $652.88, indicating a slight premium over the revised price target set by Oppenheimer.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Following significant under-performance, some high-quality businesses in these sectors are now becoming more attractive from a valuation perspective – in our language they are now getting warmer on our Bench of potential investments.\n\nOur ‘all-weather’ portfolio centred around our unique definition of ‘quality’ delivered strong performance in the September quarter. Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Natural Resource Partners, in alphabetical order), and another three companies almost reached this level of positive contribution. No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.\n\nAs part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.\n\nIntuit held its annual Investor Day during the quarter and the presentation materials are well-worth a review. Intuit is at the forefront of commercial application of artificial intelligence (AI) across its portfolio of businesses – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. Intuit has been investing in AI for many years, well before ChatGPT became a buzz word…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n07. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nUpside Potential: 7%\n\nOn January 29, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson increased the price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from $153 to $165 while affirming an Overweight rating. This adjustment reflects Keybanc's optimistic outlook on Alphabet's prospects within the technology and internet services industry. With the revised price target suggesting a 7% upside potential compared to the current market price, Patterson's decision underscores confidence in Alphabet's ability to generate value for investors. By maintaining the Overweight rating, Keybanc expresses its conviction in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) competitive position and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $165 reflects Keybanc's bullish perspective on Alphabet's long-term growth potential, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It indicates that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. At the closing time on January 29, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock was trading at $153.51, signaling a slight premium over the revised price target set by Keybanc. This adjustment is expected to influence investor sentiment and contribute to ongoing discussions about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) position as a leading player in the technology and internet services market.\n\n06. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nUpside Potential: 9%\n\nOn January 29, Morgan Stanley raised its target price on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares from $39.00 to $48.00, while maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating. This adjustment reflects Morgan Stanley's assessment of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) position within the semiconductor industry and its outlook for the company's future performance. With the revised target price suggesting a 9% upside potential compared to the current market price, Morgan Stanley's decision underscores a moderate level of optimism regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) prospects. By maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating, Morgan Stanley acknowledges Intel's strengths and weaknesses relative to its peers in the industry. This rating suggests that Intel's performance is expected to align with the broader market trends, without significant outperformance or underperformance. The raised target price of $48.00 reflects Morgan Stanley's belief in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) ability to execute its strategic initiatives and drive shareholder value over the long term. It indicates that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting a favorable investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was trading at $43.84, indicating a potential upside from the revised target price set by Morgan Stanley.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now 11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli Billionaire Mason Hawkins’ 11 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThere's a lot riding on results from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) out later today.\n\nBut the market's reaction to last week's earnings report from Netflix (NFLX) may have eased the pressure on what members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" have in store for investors this week.\n\nData from FactSet highlighted by Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer in Sunday's Morning Brief showed how much heavy lifting the Magnificent Seven companies, minus Tesla (TSLA), are expected to do for the S&P 500 this earnings season.\n\nThis group of six companies — Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft, and Nvidia (NVDA) — are expected to report earnings growth north of 50% during the fourth quarter. The rest of the index should see earnings, collectively, fall 10.4% from the same quarter last year.

(Chris Pizzello/AP Photo) (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\nWere the company to have missed these growth targets and cautioned on the benefits these initiatives are providing in pursuit of this target, investors may have judged the stock more harshly.\n\nAggregate tailwinds can only take a stock so far. Ultimately, management needs to deliver on its promises.\n\nBut the reception Netflix earned from the Street shows the willingness investors have in this environment to reward execution.\n\nWith 25% of the S&P 500 having reported earnings through last Friday, John Butters's team at FactSet found earnings beats are being rewarded more than average while misses are being penalized less than average.\n\nAnd how this trend holds up as the remaining 75% of the index reports over the coming weeks might have more to say about the market's overall direction than results from the companies most responsible for actual earnings growth.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nA South Carolina lawmaker who lost his son to suicide after the teenager fell victim to a sextortion scam is now suing Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.\n\nState Rep. Brandon Guffey is alleging that Meta engaged in deceitful practices to get users, particularly children, addicted to the company's social media platforms, resulting in \"pain and suffering\" due to poor mental health.\n\n\"I'm bringing the suit because of my personal experience of the pain of a father who lost a son,\" Guffey told Fox News Digital. \"And I believe it's due to… criminal negligence. I believe that they designed addictive algorithms that target children. They've concealed research on the harmful effects, and they've misled the public, about the correlation between their products and our current mental health crisis across the globe.\"\n\nGuffey also noted that 42 attorneys general across the country sued Meta in October, alleging that the social media giant knew its platforms were harmful to children but continued to market them to young users to increase profits; misled the public about dangers related to social media use; and knowingly collected data from users younger than 13.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA LAWMAKER EXPOSES DANGERS OF ‘SEXTORTION’ AFTER TEENAGE SON'S SUICIDE\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP Gavin Guffey, 17, died by suicide after being targeted in a sextortion scheme.\n\nGuffey's lawsuit makes similar claims, highlighting an increase in mental health and suicide concerns involving America's youth. The complaint also notes U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy's March 2023 advisory warning of a growing youth mental health crisis specifically caused by social media.\n\nWARNING SIGNS OF SUICIDE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT PREVENTION, RED FLAGS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE\n\n\"Meta conducted extensive internal studies (previously concealed) establishing its knowledge of the defective and addictive products and the impacts these products would have on adolescents,\" his complaint states. \"Nevertheless, in order to capitalize on their platforms, Meta continued exploiting users by implementing defective algorithms – in foreseeably unsafe ways and in dereliction of their basic duties of care – targeting young people, inducing harmful, unhealthy, and compulsive use by kids. \"\n\nStory continues\n\nA Meta spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement that it wants \"teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online,\" and the company has \"over 30 tools and resources to support them and their parents.\"\n\n\"We encourage teens and adults to report suspicious content, activity or accounts to us if they feel unsafe; we reach out to law enforcement in cases of imminent harm,\" the spokesperson said. \"Teens can also use NCMEC’s Take It Down, a new tool we supported that helps prevent young people’s intimate images from being posted online in the future.\"\n\nFACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM ACCUSED OF ALLOWING PREDATORS TO SHARE TIPS WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT VICTIMIZING CHILDREN\n\nOne evening in July 2022, Guffey's 17-year-old son, Gavin Guffey, received a message from someone posing as a girl on Instagram, and the pair began chatting on the social media app.\n\nThat person convinced Gavin to turn on \"vanish mode\" in their Instagram chat, which allows messages to disappear after they are received, so they could exchange photos. Guffey's 17-year-old son received a message from someone posing as a girl on Instagram, and the pair began chatting on the social media app.\n\nAfter exchanging photos, that person demanded money from Gavin, who replied that he only had $25 in his account. After sending the $25, the perpetrator demanded more.\n\n\"He even said… 'I'm sitting in my room with a gun. If these pictures go out, I'm going to end it right now,'\" the state lawmaker previously told Fox News Digital. \"I don't know if any of the pictures were shared.\"\n\nMETA IS ‘NEW TOBACCO’ AFTER STATES SUE OVER ALTERED REALITIES FOR KIDS, LEGAL GURU SAYS: ‘ELECTRONIC MORPHINE’\n\nGavin, who had just graduated from high school that spring and had a passion for art and music, shot himself that evening.\n\nAfter his death, the scammer he met on Instagram tracked down Rep. Guffey and Gavin's teenage cousin on Instagram and began demanding money from them. Gavin Guffey, who died by suicide in July 2022 after falling victim to a sextortion attempt, had just graduated from high school.\n\n\"[The perpetrator] went as far as within 30 days of me burying my son to say, ‘Did I tell you your son begged for his life?'\" the state representative recalled, adding that he considers sextortionists to be terrorists. No arrests have been made in the investigation.\n\nThe FBI defines sextortion as a \"serious crime\" in which perpetrators threaten to expose a victim's sensitive or private information in exchange for sexually explicit material or money. The agency recently announced that it received more than 13,000 reports of online financial sextortion involving at least 12,600 victims between October 2021 and March 2023.\n\nDOZENS OF STATES SUE META OVER SOCIAL MEDIA 'PROFOUNDLY ALTERED' MENTAL, SOCIAL REALITIES OF AMERICAN YOUTH\n\nThe average age of sextortion victims is between 14 and 17 years old, the FBI said in a press release last week, but the agency noted that any child can become a victim. Offenders of financially motivated sextortion typically originate from African and Southeast Asian countries, according to the FBI.\n\nSextortion can lead to suicide and self-harm. Between October 2021 and March 2023, the majority of online financial extortion victims were boys. These reports involved at least 20 suicides, the FBI said.\n\nMETA MAY BE USING YOUR FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM TO ‘FEED THE BEAST’ OF NEW TECH\n\n\"I equate it to… these digital companies are the tobacco companies of our kids' generations,\" Guffey said. \"They are fully aware of the problems that they're causing, and they care more about profits than they do about people.\"\n\nSince his son's death, Guffey has made it his life's mission to spread awareness about the dangers of sextortion and unsafe social media use in general. This lawsuit against Meta is part of that mission, he said.\n\n\"They have a permanent opponent,\" Guffey said. \"… And I'll fight it on every front. I'll fight it through legislation on the state level. I'll fight it through going to conferences and getting other states to push this legislation. I'll fight it through the media as I'm screaming my message from the mountaintops, and I'll fight it in court. I'm not going away.\"\n\nAs far as solutions go, Guffey said he believes Meta \"already knows\" how to make its social media apps less addictive and safer for minors.\n\nThe state representative believes the company should have tools to track down nude images and block whoever is involved in sending them, prevent algorithms from being used to curate content for minor users, and ensure that minors' data will not be collected, among other possible solutions.\n\nOriginal article source:South Carolina lawmaker whose son died by suicide after sextortion scam files lawsuit against Meta",

        "content": "HSBC fined £57.4m for ‘serious’ deposit protection failures. The FTSE was higher on Tuesday. (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nMarkets rose across Europe as the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) revealed it had fined banking giant HSBC (HSBA.L) £57.4m for \"failures in deposit protection identification and notification\". The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was 0.2% higher after the opening bell, while the DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.1% and the CAC (^FCHI) headed 0.1% higher. Failings outlined by the PRA included HSBC incorrectly marking 99% of its eligible beneficiary deposits as \"ineligible\" for FSCS protection; failing to produce finalised versions of annual reports; and a failure to assign clear ownership for the processes required under the Depositor Protection Rules.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nLive4 updates\n\nTue, 30 January 2024 at 3:38 am GMT-5\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nPRA slaps HSBC\n\nHere's what the two parties said:\n\n“The serious failings in this case go to the heart of the PRA’s safety and soundness objective. It is vital that all banks comply fully with our requirements around preparedness for resolution,\" said Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA. \"HBEU fell far short of its obligations in this area, and failed to disclose its failings to us in a timely manner. These failures led to today’s action, including the significant fine.” A spokesperson for HSBC said: \"HSBC is pleased to have resolved this historic matter, which relates to the Bank’s compliance with certain parts of the PRA’s Depositor Protection Rules. The PRA’s final notice recognises the Bank’s co-operation with the investigation, as well as our efforts to fully resolve these issues. We continue to remain focused on serving our customers.\" Tue, 30 January 2024 at 3:24 am GMT-5\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nOvernight in Asia\n\nOver in Asia, stocks saw another mixed day of trade, with some heavy selling across China. The Hang Seng (^HSI) finished 2.6% lower, while the SSE Composite (000001.SS) was down 1.8%.\n\nThe selling came in the aftermath of the liquidation of an order for the liquidation of Evergrande, the world's most indebted property company. The Hang Seng is down more than 7% alone this month.\n\nConcerns remain about China's economic growth going forward. Tue, 30 January 2024 at 3:24 am GMT-5\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nOvernight in the US\n\nUS stocks closed in positive territory overnight, ahead of a slew of earnings reports and company updates, as well as an interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve later in the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) finished 0.7% higher on Monday, while the Dow (^DJI) was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) gained 1.1%.\n\nMicrosoft is set to report earnings after the bell later on today, while Amazon will reveal all on Thursday.\n\nMore on that here.

        "title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Vision Pro Is a Potential Silver Lining",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.\n\nLooking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.\n\nAccording to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.\n\nThere is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.\n\nApple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.\n\nToday, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.\n\nThe relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.\n\nApple’s Scale Problem\n\nApple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.\n\nThe problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.\n\nEven if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.\n\nIs Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nApple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple’s prospects, but they’re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here’s what some analysts have said about Apple.\n\nOn January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock’s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.\n\nOn January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.\n\nLast week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.\n\nOverall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.\n\nThe Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not\n\nApple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Monday, January 29, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+168.0% vs. +65.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels and Llama 2, is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues, along with targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+25.4% vs. +21.4%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\r\n\r\nContinued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\r\n\r\nHowever, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the underwriting results. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+40.6% vs. +15.6%). The company being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.\r\n\r\nThese factors have been helping it register decent sales and earnings numbers. This outlook reflects Costco’s ability to navigate the challenging operating environment, generate solid sales, and register high membership renewal rates.\r\n\r\nA favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Costco Wholesale here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Comcast Corporation (CMCSA), RTX Corporation (RTX) and PACCAR Inc (PCAR).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "Nasdaq 100’s Hidden Gems: 7 Tech Stock Bargains Ready to Boom",
        "content": "Coming off a year where the Nasdaq 100 gained 55%, you wouldn’t expect there to be many Nasdaq 100 tech bargains, let alone the index to have a repeat performance in 2024. Yet, the technology-laden benchmark is leading the way again a month into the new year. It’s up over 3% so far in January, which would lead to another annual gain of about 45% if it maintained that pace!\n\nOf course, it’s unrealistic to expect the market to keep growing like that. For example, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) just offered near-term guidance that cut the knees out of its stock, and other chipmakers sympathized. Semiconductor stocks had been among the best performers last year. You can expect continued volatility in the sector and other markets, too.\n\nEven so, while the index is still near its all-time highs, Nasdaq 100 tech bargains are available. What follows are the seven best opportunities to cash in on future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: Cisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe reason Intel’s guidance sucked was because companies are rushing headlong into artificial intelligence (AI) data center chips and away from standard processors. While Intel is late to the game, those same forces are exactly why Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is taking off. Shares are up 10% over the past few months. I see that as only the beginning.\n\nCisco sees massive orders piling up for its AI-based Ethernet architecture that runs under the GPU architecture. CEO Chuck Robbins sees $1 billion in order flow coming in fiscal year 2025, or twice as much as previously predicted. That’s because that’s when the Ethernet buildout will really take off. Cisco already has its Ethernet fabric deployed at three major hyperscalers. The world’s four largest hyperscale platforms are Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Together, they account for around 78% of total capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco also works with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and even Intel to develop Ethernet technologies for GPU-enabled infrastructure. That makes the networking hardware leader part of this tightly-knit growth industry that shows no sign of letting up.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe ongoing buildout of the cloud also means the data transitioning from brick-and-mortar data centers needs protection. Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government organizations. And it’s not just with the underlying architecture where AI plays a leading role. Next-generation data and app security driven by AI tools is in high demand. After two disappointing quarters, though, Fortinet is growing again.\n\nMuch of the cybersecurity specialist’s business was centered around hardware-based firewalls monitoring traffic for physical data centers. As we said before, enterprise spending was moving to the cloud. But Fortinet has heavily invested in AI, and its secure access service edge (SASE) offerings are expanding. Fortinet says SASE is a $17 billion market growing at a 20% compounded annual rate and is expected to hit $36 billion by 2027. It sees continued momentum of its SASE solutions that were adopted by internet providers, including AT&T (NYSE:T), British Telecom (OTCMKTS:BTGOF), Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), and others.\n\nFTNT stock is up 50% from the lows it hit after earnings, but more growth will come.\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: Lam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe pell-mell rush into AI chips also boosts Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), the premier manufacturer of specialized semiconductor equipment. Its etch and deposition tools allow for more sophisticated chips and advanced packaging techniques that AI requires. Etching is the selective removal of film and material from a wafer to create features customers want.\n\nThis is another tremendous growth opportunity because of the new chip design technology under development. Called gate-all-around (GAA), manufacturers can have material on all four sides of a transistor instead of three. It could greatly increase chip speed and efficiency.\n\nLam Research sees it as alone being a $1 billion opportunity. As Lam is one of the few equipment manufacturers that could handle such an increase, it can reap the benefits. It is already approaching a 75% market share in the space.\n\nSales and profits are growing, as its recently released earnings report indicated. Yet, trading at only 23 times next year’s earnings estimates is a bargain stock to buy.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is also cashing in on the demand for cybersecurity products. Unlike Fortinet, however, it has been hitting the mark each quarter. Its stock is up 115% over the last 12 months and is 16% higher so far this year. Sales and profits are on a rocket-ride higher with earnings increasing 10-fold year over year last quarter.\n\nDriving this performance is its new AI-powered Cortex platform (I’m sensing a theme with what makes a business successful these days). Cortex now has 5,300 customers, up 25%, and it was the first to achieve 100% detection and prevention from cyberattacks in industry-standard testing.\n\nWhat sets Palo Alto Networks apart from the crowded cybersecurity field is its agnostic approach to protection. It offers SASE products, cloud, on-site, hybrid protection solutions, next-gen firewalls, and more. By giving the customer what it wants, it has met the broadest needs of the market. With Wall Street expecting earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years, Palo Alto Networks should record a sonic boom in growth.\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: ASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLike Lam Research, ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) offers specialized semiconductor equipment for AI chip production. It differs from the competition because it has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. It is the world’s only manufacturer of the machines needed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel, Samsung, and other chipmakers.\n\nThese machines are not exactly mass-produced either. It built just 345 lithography systems last year, 81 immersion systems, and only 40 EUV machines. But what it lacks in volume, ASML makes up for in price. The EUV equipment, for example, goes for around $200 million a pop.\n\nYet ASML is in the process of further cementing its dominance by developing next-generation high-numerical aperture (high-NA) lithography systems. These will allow its customers to produce even smaller chips. They’re also not bargain-basement priced. These next-gen machines sell for about $300 million each. It shipped the first one to Intel in December.\n\nThat’s why the stock is still undervalued despite ASML stock trading at an all-time high. It already enjoys rich profit margins, and analysts forecast it will grow earnings 24% annually for the next five years.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facade\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe ongoing 5G infrastructure rollout is arguably the biggest driver of future growth for telecom giant T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). It marks the first major upgrade to the country’s telecom infrastructure, allowing greater download speeds. Because data consumption is the biggest profit center for telecoms, the upgrade will help boost earnings further. The analysts at PwC forecast global data consumption over telecom networks will grow nearly three-fold from 3.4 million petabytes (PB) in 2022 to 9.7 million PB in 2027.\n\nT-Mobile stands to benefit the most as it recently became the largest U.S. wireless carrier, edging out Verizon (NYSE:VZ). It recorded 21.6 million prepaid users, while its rival slipped to 21.4 million.\n\nI’ve noted before Wall Street forecasts T-Mobile will enjoy an incredible run-up in earnings over the next few years. Analysts estimate profits will expand 43% a year in the long term. At that rate, the stock trades at just a tiny fraction of that growth rate. Investors can expect explosive gains to continue.\n\nRoper Technologies (ROP) Image of Roper Technologies logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) is arguably one of the most under-the-radar technology stocks. It plies its trade in application software, network software, and tech-enabled products, giving it broad market coverage. It’s not flashy like other tech stocks, but it says it is the leader in most markets in which it operates. At the same time, no single competitor competes with it over many product lines. It’s the jack-of-all-trades of tech stocks.\n\nYet Roper still mastered growth. Over the past three decades, Roper Technologies generated total returns of over 33,200%. In contrast, the S&P 500 managed just 2,100% returns. It’s up 24% in the past year and just plods on, growing year after year.\n\nWall Street expects long-term earnings growth to triple compared to the last five years. It pursues a growth-by-acquisition strategy, buying asset-light, cash-generating businesses. It then reinvests this excess cash in businesses seeking incrementally higher rates of return.\n\nRoper Technologies has a decades-long track record of success and seems equally prepared for decades of growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T stock.

        "title": "One chart shows why Big Tech earnings are critical for the health of the market rally",
        "content": "The stock market is still all about tech.\n\nNew data from FactSet shows that while strategists have called for a broadening out of the market rally, big tech companies are expected to be the drivers of Q4 earnings growth in the S&P 500.\n\nEarnings for Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to grow a combined 53.7% in the fourth quarter. The other 494 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see a 10.5% decline.\n\nFive of those companies —Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta — are set to report quarterly results this week.\n\nAfter the remaining Magnificent Seven tech stock, Tesla (TSLA), disappointed with its report, Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nThe expectations for some names are massive. Nvidia is expected to grow earnings per share by more than 400% compared to the same period a year prior. Analysts project Meta's earnings per share to grow 175% from the same period a year prior.\n\nThe eye-popping growth for some of the largest stocks in the market is expected to continue next quarter, too. A second chart from FactSet shows that Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are expected to grow earnings by nearly 80% in the first quarter of 2024. The other 496 companies, including Apple Microsoft and Tesla, are expected to grow earnings by a combined 0.3%.\n\n\"Their earnings are incredible compared to the rest of the market,\" JJ Kinahan, IG North America's CEO told Yahoo Finance Live. \"You don't often see this where a few stocks are so outperforming the rest of the market.\"\n\nTo some on Wall Street, these massive earnings expectations help explain why the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs and still might not be overvalued.\n\n\"There's more growth in that [S&P 500] valuation now than there used to be,\" Pettit said, nodding to the increased position of technology in the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the market's recent rally, nearly 90% of the growth seen in January has also been driven by the same tech companies excluding Tesla, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. This comes after the seven tech companies were the major market driver in 2023, and it creates a simple reason for why investors will be watching these reports closely.\n\nStill tech earnings expectations go beyond just the quarterly numbers. It's about updates on various market-moving narratives during earnings calls, too.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been at the center of earnings improvements for Meta and Nvidia. Microsoft and Amazon both have AI plays, too, but their cloud revenues are typically more closely scrutinized. Additionally, Apple's products business can provide a lens into demand for hardware and the overall state of consumer spending.\n\nAll of this combines to make tech earnings crucial for the market — not only because people expect Big Tech to do well but because if their results miss estimates, the lagging parts of their business could be a flashing a warning sign about an economic slowdown.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 leading cities for startups in the US. If you want to skip our discussion on the global startup ecosystem rankings, you can go directly to the 5 Leading Cities For Startups In The US.\n\nIn recent years, the global startup landscape has observed many shifts and developments. According to reports, the leading countries for startups have remained consistent since 2021, with the USA taking the lead, followed by the UK, Israel, and Canada. Despite the uncertainties surrounding startups in 2022, these nations have demonstrated resilience, leading to stronger startup economies. A surprising development in the global startup rankings was China's decline from 10th position in 2022 to 12th position in 2023. Capitalizing on this shift, Singapore made a jump to the 6th position worldwide, surpassing Germany. The US maintained its leadership in the startup domain and continues to lead various industries. It currently houses the highest number of startups, followed by China and the UK. This information holds significance as opting for the right location can enhance the likelihood of success by providing access to high-quality opportunities and stakeholders.\n\nA good strategy for startup success involves establishing a business in one of the best startup cities in the world. In comparison to other areas, the North American region stands out for its consistent stability in global startup rankings, featuring numerous top-tier countries and cities for startups in 2023. Some of the leading cities for startups in the US include Austin and Chicago. Meanwhile, the European region leads globally with the highest number of cities in the top 1,000 rankings, boasting 410 cities in 2023, as opposed to 426 cities in 2022.\n\nThe startup ecosystem is likely to observe substantial growth in several industries in the coming years. The software as a service (SaaS) industry is predicted to reach a value of $716 billion by 2028. Another rapidly expanding industry in the startup landscape is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is expected to exceed a valuation of $1.5 trillion by 2030. Since 2017, the AI blockchain industry has seen substantial growth in funding, increasing by more than 90%. Robotics closely follows suit, with funding increasing by as much as 70% during the same period. Meanwhile, Agritech and New Food startups experienced a 128% increase in funding between 2021-2022. Hellofresh SE (ETR:HFG), a German meal-kit company founded in 2011, is a notable player in this space. It is currently providing services in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. It delivers packages with all ingredients for a specific recipe to customers’ homes. The company was founded in 2011 and went public in November 2017.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of 2023, TikTok’s parent company “ByteDance” is the world’s most valuable unicorn company. Other prominent companies that were once unicorns include Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). You can also check out the 25 Largest VC Backed Companies In The US in 2023 here.\n\nHere’s what Polen Capital said about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies provides ride hailing services to customers worldwide. The Company develops applications for road transportation, navigation, ride sharing, and payment processing solutions. Polen Capital originally purchased the 4.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029 in our client accounts on the back of the Company’s new focus on profitability and free-cash-flow generation. Our view was that the Company’s credit metrics would improve over the next two-to-three years to levels on par with investment grade issuers. The Company’s fundamental profile has improved which resulted in spread tightening. Given the yield currently offered on the Notes, Polen Capital sold down its exposure and used the proceeds to purchase higher yielding debt instruments.” 20 Leading Cities for Startups In The US\n\nPhoto by Ant Rozetsky on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 leading cities for startups in the US, we consulted various credible sources such as Startup Savant, Startup Genome, and StartupBlink to acquire the latest information and data on the startup ecosystem.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 47% of His Portfolio Invested in 5 Superb Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper runs Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993, and has long been one of the brightest stars on Wall Street. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,\" by Forbes. Tepper has \"consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa's] inception,\" according to Tepper's bio posted by Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nOver the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by 15%, no small feat, given the macroeconomic backdrop. His strong track record suggests that Tepper's stock picks might be worth further review. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors might be surprised to discover that, to close out the third quarter, Tepper had a whopping 47.1% of Appaloosa's portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 11.6% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 10.2% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 9.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 8.8% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 7.2%\n\nLet's take a look at Tepper's five top picks to see why he's so heavily weighted toward these AI stocks.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms might seem a surprising choice, but the company has a long history of using AI to bolster its business. The vast majority of Meta's revenue comes from digital advertising, and AI can more accurately surface relevant ads and other content on its social media sites.\n\nAs the world's second-largest digital advertiser, the recent rebound in ad spending has bolstered the company's fortunes. Meta has also released several AI-powered tools to help advertisers more accurately connect with their target market. Perhaps as importantly, the company developed a leading open-source AI model -- Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud infrastructure platforms, resulting in an entirely new revenue stream for the company.\n\nAt just 20 times forward earnings, Meta is selling at a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Tepper's investing decision.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft saw the writing on the wall and invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the past few years, helping spotlight the potential for generative AI. Its big tech rivals quickly follow suit, kicking demand for AI into overdrive. The tech giant answered the growing demand by infusing AI functionality across a broad swath of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. Furthermore, all the most popular AI models are available on Azure Cloud.\n\nThe biggest coup, however, was the debut of Microsoft Copilot, its AI assistant. Its ability to increase user productivity has generated strong demand and could produce incremental revenue of up to $100 billion by 2027, according to analyst calculations. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the third quarter, and Microsoft pointed out that three percentage points of that growth was the result of growing demand for AI.\n\nMicrosoft is currently trading for 31 times forward earnings. While that's a slight premium to the market, the company's strong legacy businesses and the opportunity afforded by AI make Microsoft a bargain at this price, which likely didn't escape Tepper's notice.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nWhile some viewed Amazon as slow out of the gate, it has jumped into the AI opportunity with both feet. The company has long used AI to handle product recommendations, inventory levels, delivery routes, and more.\n\nYet that's just the beginning of Amazon's AI opportunity. The company is now using generative AI to improve product listings, generate review summaries, and refine advertising. It also is working on an AI-powered tool that can answer questions about specific products.\n\nThere's more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a growing list of popular generative AI models, including a few of its own via its Bedrock AI. The company has also unveiled several AI-centric chips, including Inferentia and Trainium, designed to speed AI processing for AWS customers.\n\nDespite its strong recovery last year, Amazon is still selling for just 2 times forward sales, the standard for an underpriced stock, which likely piqued Tepper's interest.\n\n4. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion about AI stocks would be complete without a nod to Nvidia, a point highlighted by Tepper's position. Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized gaming and are the gold standard for AI applications.\n\nNvidia's processors have cornered the market in both data centers and machine learning, with an estimated 95% share in each. Experience in the field helped Nvidia quickly pivot to address the growing demand for generative AI.\n\nCompetitors are scrambling to develop competing processors, but Nvidia continues to maintain its edge. For the nine months ended Oct. 29, 2023, Nvidia spent $6.2 billion, or 16% of its total revenue, on research and development. The company's track record of continuing innovation will make it difficult to supplant.\n\nDespite the stock's recent run, Nvidia is still remarkably cheap, sporting a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- that benchmark for an undervalued stock -- of which Tepper was no doubt keenly aware.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Alphabet makes the lion's share of its revenue from digital advertising, in this case fueled by Google Search. The company has an impressive track record of deploying AI to improve its search algorithms and ad targeting, and the recovering ad market will no doubt improve the company's results.\n\nAlphabet didn't sleep on the potential of generative AI. The company integrated AI functionality into many of its flagship Google and Android products. As one of the Big Three cloud providers, it was able to expand the number of AI systems available to its Google Cloud customers.\n\nIts most recent offering, Gemini AI, is being hailed by the company as its \"largest and most capable AI model,\" outperforming rivals using a variety of widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, Alphabet's Vertex AI provides access to 130 foundational AI models with something for just about every use case.\n\nThe company's rebound over the past year notwithstanding, Alphabet still sells for just 19 times forward earnings, a valuation that Tepper likely couldn't pass up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "16 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the16 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nMore and more investors turned to quality in 2023 as interest rates went higher amid the inflation storm. The iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF gained 29% in 2023, beating the S&P 500 returns of 24%. The rise of Magnificent Seven stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a sign of the market's concentration in quality as investors flocked to companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals. But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled \"Quality Minus Junk\" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:\n\n\"We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.\"\n\nWhile the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024. Why?  High-quality stocks tend to perform better when growth is slowing down. A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:\n\n\"Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.\" Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\n\nPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26. From these stocks we picked 16 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n16. Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nTransportation services company Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In October Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) posted Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $1.71, beating estimates by $0.01.\n\n15. American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nWith a dividend yield of 2% and a PE ratio of 13, insurance and financial solutions company American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 42 hedge funds had stakes in American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Insurance company American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was also among our top contributors. The company’s most recent operating results outperformed expectations, as it reported robust earnings with improving underwriting margins in the property and casualty business. AIG’s strategic initiatives also added to the positive sentiment. The company made further progress in separating its Life & Retirement unit by selling additional shares via a secondary offering. Furthermore, AIG announced the sale of its reinsurance business to RenaissanceRe at an attractive valuation, a move that will further reduce volatility in AIG’s continuing operations.”\n\n14. Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) is one of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nEarlier this month, Wolfe Research upgraded Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) along with some other semiconductor stocks as it becomes \"incrementally more bullish\" on analog circuits.\n\n\"We stayed neutral on analog for too long this cycle, since stocks bottomed an unprecedented full year before fundamentals began to deteriorate,\" Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note.\n\nHere is what Weitz Conservative Allocation Fund has to say about Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added a new position in Microchip Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ:MCHP) to the Fund during the quarter. Microchip is a leading provider of mixed signal microcontrollers and analog semiconductors to a broad range of industrial, data center, automotive, communication and consumer appliance customers. The company enjoys favorable product characteristics that help drive strong profitability, and it benefits from several long-wave demand tailwinds such as electronification, automation, and growth in data communications. While Microchip is not immune from semiconductor cycles, its cash flows have been durable through cycles. The multi-year outlook is solid, and we think the company is poised to further boost per-share value growth through increasing share repurchases at discounted prices.\n\n13. Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nHR and payroll solutions company Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) ranks 13th in our list of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to smart money investors. Earlier this month Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) declared a $0.89 per share dividend, in line with the previous dividend. Paychex Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PAYX) board also approved to buy back up to $400 million of its common stock beginning February 1, 2024 and expiring on May 31, 2027.\n\nEnsemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) (3.71% weight in the Fund): While employment growth was strong in 2023, the Fed’s efforts to moderate job growth was successful. Paychex business is driven by the number of employees on the payrolls of its small to medium size business customers. With recession worries percolating all year, the stock was flat on a year to date basis in late October just as the economic outlook began to brighten. As recession worries faded the stock rallied to gains of as much as 13% in the fourth quarter. But in the late December earnings report, the company said that core payroll services growth would be a bit weaker than investors expected. Despite this, the company slightly raised full year earnings guidance as demand for their full service solution that incorporates human resources services beyond payroll improved. The stock finished the quarter up 4.1%.”\n\n12. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 48\n\nIn December, Morgan Stanley published a list of 32 stocks with high free cash flow, high earnings per share growth, and an overweight rating in its U.S. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) made it to the list.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 48 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) during this period was Paul Singer's Elliott Management which owns a $1.7 billion stake in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC).\n\n11. Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 53\n\nOppenheimer recently started covering Builders FirstSource with an Outperform rating. Here is what the firm said about Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):\n\n“The company has a market-leading position in a fragmented industry and should benefit from our optimistic view of single-family housing starts in 2024. Growth in value-added products increases the amount of revenue tied to services and is a positive for gross margin and returns.”\n\nOver the past one year Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) shares have gained about 124%.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Bonhoeffer Capital Management stated the following regarding Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):\n\n“Over the past 12 months, interest rates have been increasing, which has reduced the economics of this strategy; but a large spread still exists if assets can be purchased at the right price. Increasing interest rates has affected the returns on public LBO firms. Some firms, like Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) (described below), have reacted to higher interest rates by moderating their use of debt in their expansion plans.\n\nBuilders FirstSource, a portfolio holding, is an example of a private LBO. Given BLDR’s current valuation of an 11% earnings yield and, more importantly, a five-year forward earnings yield of 15%, buybacks are accretive. The net income annual growth is expected to be between 17-20% over the next four years based upon management’s guidance. This net income growth would imply a 17-20% total return before changes to the current modest valuation of 9x earnings. Below is the history of BLDR’s RoIC and RoIIC…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10. Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nWith a dividend yield of 3.7% and a low PE ratio, Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a notable member of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF portfolio. The stock is up about 3.9% over the past six months.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management which owns a $358 million stake in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD):\n\n“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”\n\n9. Target Corp (NYSE:TGT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 58\n\nUS retailer Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is a key part of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF. The stock has a dividend yield of over 3% and had 58 hedge fund investors as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTarget Corp (NYSE:TGT) is also among the stocks Morgan Stanley is recommending for 2024.\n\nLike Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), hedge funds are also buying Target.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT):\n\n“Other meaningful moves during the quarter included additions to cyclical growers we consider early cycle consumer plays: Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), a position initiated in the third quarter, and Estee Lauder. As earnings start to recover, these stocks and semiconductors tend to be among the first to move. We may be a little early and could see some choppiness in stock prices as job growth and consumer spending cool due to the lagged effects of Fed tightening, but we believe we’re closer to the bottom in terms of economic activity and that both companies, as well as Union Pacific, are well-positioned to benefit as consumer sentiment improves and the economy begins to recover.”\n\n8. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 64\n\nPiper Sandler recently said in a report that Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares have \"reversed\" a downtrend and the investment firm expects more upside to the stock.\n\nPiper Sandler mentioned this in its Technical Research report on SMID Momentum. Piper Sandler said:\n\n“We are optimistic about equities with the (SPX), (INDU), and (NDX) hitting record highs, but waning market breadth is a notable concern. We saw some signs of rotation yesterday as SMID-caps began rallying out of their three-week pullbacks.”\n\nOakmark Fund made the following comment about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\n7. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) ranks seventh in our list of the most undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Bristol-Myers has a dividend yield of about 4.8% and its biggest shareholder as of the end of the third quarter of 2023 was John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $384 million stake.\n\nOut of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 65 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY).\n\nIn addition to BMY, hedge funds are also piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and The Walt Disney Company. We added Texas Instruments as a new position. Bristol-Myers has been dealing with the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid, one of its key products. Although the company is launching new drugs in melanoma, heart failure, and psoriasis it will need additional products to offset the lower revenue in Revlimid.”\n\n6. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nEarlier in January, BofA listed its Efficient Growth Index top members for 2023’s fourth quarter in its RIC Report. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was part of the list of stocks mentioned in the report.\n\nWith a PE ratio of 27 and a 3% dividend yield, PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) ranks sixth in our list of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Insider Monkey's proprietary database of 910 funds shows that 65 funds had stakes in PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as of the end of the September quarter.\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP): PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and snack food company with a portfolio of brands, including Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. The company, through its operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells a wide variety of beverages and snack foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nPEP, through acquisitions, marketing, and product innovation has reinvigorated top line expansion and is now expected to grow revenues in the mid-single digit percent rate for the foreseeable future. We expect this revenue growth to drive margin expansion and free cash flow growth from $5.6 billion in 2022 to $12.3 billion in 2028. Based on this more than doubling of free cash flow and the company’s 2.8% dividend yield, we believe we can achieve double digit rates of return from the stock regardless of the economic environment ahead. We initiated a small position in August.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Undervalued Defensive Stocks For 2024 12 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit 15 Quality Undervalued Non-Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "The metaverse is back, creating a massive opportunity for some of the best metaverse stocks.\n\nYep, that network of shared, immersive virtual worlds where you can play, work, and even shop with millions of other people is back. The same one that helped Mark Zuckerberg and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) rack up about $46.5 billion in losses since 2019.\n\nShould the metaverse idea take off this time, Statista says we could be looking at a potential $490.4 billion market by 2030. With hopes that it will – thanks in part to AI – investors may want to consider some of the best metaverse stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Colorful arrows pointing at the multicolored word \"ETF\" against a cement surface\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/eamesBot\n\nSince late last year, the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV) rallied from a low of about $9.05 to a recent high of $11.67.\n\nAll should help push the METV ETF even higher, along with the metaverse comeback story. With an expense ratio of 0.59%.\n\nFor anyone looking to diversify with some of the metaverse stocks with low fees, the METV ETF is an attractive place to park your cash long-term.\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) keyboard featuring a bull on the etf key. etfs to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJust as explosive, the ProShares Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:VERS) ran from about $33 to $42.11, and could see higher highs.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.58%, the ETF tracks the Solactive Metaverse Theme Index, and offers investors access to companies shaping the virtual world.\n\nAs you wait for the metaverse ETF to push higher, why not get paid for it?\n\niShares Future Metaverse Tech and Communications ETF (IVRS) communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earth\n\nSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also the iShares Future Metaverse Tech and Communications ETF (NYSEARCA:IVRS), which invests in tech hardware and software stocks associated with the metaverse.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.47%, the ETF holds impressive tech stocks. At the moment, it’s a very low volume ETF that trades just under $33 a share.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U), which provides software platforms that create and operate interactive, real-time 3D content.\n\nWhile its chart has seen better days, don’t write the stock off just yet. For one, the company is cutting about 25% of its workforce, becoming far more focused on eventual profitability.\n\nTwo, with the resurgence of the metaverse, Unity Software could come back strong, with patience. Three, Unity is “bringing its powerful authoring tools for creating immersive real-time 3D apps and simulations to Apple’s new spatial computing platform, Apple Vision Pro,” according to Unity’s site.\n\n“We’ve been working with Unity to bring those apps to Vision Pro, so popular Unity-based games and apps can gain full access to VisionOS features such as Passthrough, high-resolution rendering and native gestures,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of worldwide developer relations, as quoted by CNBC.\n\nWith that, I’d take advantage of the recent, and most likely temporary pullback in U. From its current price of around $33, I’d like to see the stock retest $50 initially.\n\nRoblox Corp. (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox is the closest thing to a mainstream metaverse. With a mission to build a human co-experience platform that enables billions of users to come together to play, learn, communicate, and explore, it’s one of the top metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nBetter, the company currently has about 70.2 million daily active users. All of which “create, play, work, learn, and connect with each other in experiences built by our global community of creators,” as noted by the company.\n\nEarnings are just as exciting here. In its most recent quarter, the company saw revenue growth of 38% to $713.2 million year over year. Bookings were up 20% year over year to $839.5 million. Average daily users jumped 20% to 70.2 million.\n\n“Our strong third-quarter results reflect our continued platform innovation and growth across all age groups and geographies. We are executing against our key priorities to enable deeper forms of immersion, communication, and Avatar expression on the platform, while investing in artificial intelligence, brands, and advertising, to drive future growth,” added David Baszucki, founder and CEO of Roblox.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also the super-explosive Nvidia, which just ran from a low of about $400 to $616.17. From here, it could easily test $700 near-term, possibly $1,000 by year-end.\n\nAll thanks to incredible demand for its AI chips, which show no signs of slowing.\n\nBetter, KeyBanc, which cited strong demand for AI chips by data centers, hiked their price target to $740 from $650, with an overweight rating. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald also initiated coverage of NVDA with an overweight rating with a $775 price target.\n\nWe also have to remember that Nvidia is a key part of the metaverse. For example, it just announced a “suite of new generative AI tools for users to experiment with on Omniverse, its real-time graphics collaboration platform,” as noted by CyberNews.com. It’s even partnered with tech giants like Microsoft to bring the industrial metaverse and AI to millions of users.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms – now a $3 trillion company — still plays an essential role in the future of the metaverse, even though it lost billions of dollars with it so far.\n\nAccording to XRToday.com, Porsche will leverage Meta’s “MR headsets to create immersive presentations for upcoming vehicles in a bid to showcase how emerging Metaverse services provide business value.\n\nWith its partnership, Porsche allows multiple attendees to move around and interact with a shared VR environment during new and upcoming product showcases.”\n\nThat’s another reason to get excited about the metaverse comeback.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "These Are the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2024, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "The big winners of the past aren't always the big winners of the future. However, that doesn't mean that it won't be the case.\n\nIn 2023, the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks ruled the stock market. Each of the seven stocks skyrocketed by 48% or more (for some, much more). But how does Wall Street think they'll perform going forward?\n\nNot-so-magnificent forecasts\n\nWall Street has some not-so-magnificent forecasts for most of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) delivered the second-biggest gain of the group last year, with its share price nearly tripling in value. The stock is off to a good start in 2024 as well, rising more than 10%. The average 12-month price target for Meta is even lower than its current share price now, though.\n\nAnalysts don't have great expectations for Alphabet, either. The Google parent's shares vaulted 58% higher in 2023. The consensus price target for the stock today reflects a meager upside potential of around 2%.\n\nApple doesn't fare much better on Wall Street. Although the tech giant's shares jumped 48% last year, analysts' average price target for the stock is only 3% above the current share price.\n\nMicrosoft is running neck-and-neck with Apple as the biggest company based on market cap after a 57% gain in 2023. Analysts aren't looking for the momentum to continue, however. The consensus price target reflects an upside potential of around 4%.\n\nNo large-cap stock generated as much excitement last year as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The generative AI boom drove the chipmaker's share price up a whopping 239%. Nvidia has extended those gains so far in 2024, rising close to 25%. The party won't keep going, according to Wall Street. The average price target for Nvidia is less than 5% above its current share price.\n\nWall Street's favorites\n\nIf you've kept count, we've ruled out five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That leaves only Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla boasts the greatest upside potential based on the latest data available even after its shares more than doubled last year. The average 12-month price target for the stock is nearly 24% above the electric vehicle maker's current share price.\n\nHowever, there's a big gotcha. Tesla's shares sank last week after the company announced disappointing fourth-quarter results. Its warning of a major slowdown in sales growth in 2024 was especially worrisome. Don't be surprised if some analysts soon lower their price targets for the stock.\n\nAmazon stock vaulted 81% higher in 2023. Many on Wall Street think that it will keep the momentum going this year. The consensus price target for Amazon reflects an upside potential of nearly 16%.\n\nThere's also more of a consensus about Amazon than there is for Tesla. Of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in January who cover the stock, 43 rated it as a buy or strong buy. Only eight of the 23 analysts who cover Tesla recommended it as a buy or a strong buy. Seven analysts rated the stock as an \"underperform\" or recommended selling it.\n\nAre the analysts right?\n\nI wouldn't bet the farm that any of Wall Street's price targets will prove to be accurate. There's no way to know for sure how a given stock will perform over a 12-month period.\n\nIf I had to guess which of these stocks will beat analysts' expectations the most, I'd go with Meta. Its valuation looks relatively attractive. I won't be surprised if the company's earnings continue to grow if the economy doesn't falter.\n\nWhich \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is Wall Street most likely to be right about? Probably Amazon, in my opinion. The company's profitability and free cash flow are improving significantly.

        "content": "Rowan Street Capital, an investment management company, released its 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The year 2023 proved to be a successful one for the fund as it recorded a net gain of +102.6%. In 2023, Meta Platforms (+194%), Spotify (+138%), Trade Desk (+60%), and Shopify (+124%) were the main contributors to the outperformance. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nRowan Street Capital featured stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its 2023 annual investor letter. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a technology company that develops products to connect people. On January 26, 2024, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock closed at $394.14 per share. One-month return of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was 11.35%, and its shares gained 168.01% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a market capitalization of $1.013 trillion.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its 2023 annual investor letter:\n\n\"Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has become our largest position in the fund, up +268% in just 14 months, aging very well from our November 2022 note. We gave a re-cap of this extraordinary move in our last letter in November and we encourage you to review. Our investment in Meta makes a great case to study. We first invested in the stock in 2018 and we just recently doubled our money on this investment in 2023. It took exactly 5 years and provided a very decent return of 15% per annum, however it hasn’t exactly been a smooth ride. Please take a look at the chart below:\n\nAs you can see, we first started buying the stock in April of 2018 at $150 and then added in December of 2018 when the price dropped to $135, adding further to our position when the stock eventually rose to mid-200s. In the first two years there was zero return from our investment. Covid took the stock to new highs of $372, and subsequently, in 2022, the stock dropped to new lows of $89 — a price not seen since 2015. When we wrote our note on Meta last year, we were sitting on a negative return for a 4 year time period. This can be pretty demoralizing and discouraging to investors. However, it is very crucial to be able to adopt the mentality of a business owner and to focus solely on the fundamentals of the business itself rather than the narrative around the stock. It’s interesting (and it happens very often in the world of investing) that you can have 3-4 years of zero to negative returns and then the stock can quickly skyrocket in just 6-12 months, paying handsomely for the wait. Staying invested when the stock experiences this kind of volatility can be emotionally difficult and there could be a lot of pressure to sell throughout the journey. However, if our investment thesis has not changed, management is executing well and the business continues to grow and make more money over time, we can afford to wait.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCopyright: rvlsoft / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were subdued on Monday, with markets preparing for a busy week of major earnings and central bank policy announcements. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among many of the tech giants due to report results this week, while the Federal Reserve will unveil its latest policy decision and deliver closely-watched commentary that could help determine the path ahead for interest rates. China Evergrande (HK:3333) is ordered to liquidate, starting a new and possibly lengthy chapter for the heavily indebted property developer.\n\n1. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around both sides of the flatline on Monday, as traders geared up for a week of key corporate earnings and central bank decisions.\n\nBy 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 55 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 19 points or 0.1%.\n\nA solid start to the new year for the main averages on Wall Street will likely face a stern exam in the coming days. Investors will be parsing through numbers from some of America's largest businesses and digesting influential commentary from the Federal Reserve, both of which may help clarify the outlook for the broader economy (see below).\n\nThe S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% on Friday, leaving the benchmark index near all-time highs, a move that reflects market hopes that inflation may be cooling without a meltdown in growth -- a scenario commonly referred to as a \"soft landing.\" The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also fell by 0.4% to end the prior trading week, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%.\n\n2. Big-name earnings ahead\n\nA parade of high-profile and possibly market-moving results are due out from a string of companies this week, including many of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have powered a recent surge in equities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft will report after the bell, only days after the tech giant's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which like Microsoft has been a beneficiary of a wave of hype around artificial intelligence, will also unveil its latest numbers following the close of markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday will feature semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), with investors on the lookout for the San Diego-based group's view of the year ahead for chipmaking. Quarterly figures are also due from Boeing (NYSE:BA), the embattled planemaker who has come under fresh scrutiny following a dangerous mid-flight blowout on one of its 737 Max 9 models earlier this month, as well as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), the Danish drugmaker behind the popular weight loss medication Wegovy.\n\nMore megacap tech firms are set to step into the limelight on Thursday, including iPhone-maker Apple, e-commerce behemoth Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\n3. Fed decision in focus\n\nMarkets will also be keeping their eye on the Federal Reserve, as the world's most influential central bank holds its latest two-day policy meeting.\n\nFed officials are tipped to keep interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs following the gathering on Wednesday, placing extra focus on any comments regarding the outlook for borrowing costs in the near term.\n\nIn December, the Fed signaled that it could reduce rates six times this year, fueling hopes for a cut as early as March. But several policymakers have moved to temper these expectations, indicating that worries remain that a rapid loosening in financial conditions could reignite cooling inflationary pressures.\n\nA stronger-than-expected advance estimate of fourth-quarter U.S. growth last week also bolstered the case for the Fed to hold off on lowering rates any time soon. Meanwhile, economists expect January nonfarm payrolls on Friday to show ongoing resilience in the U.S. labor market -- although the Fed will not be able to factor this particular piece of data into its latest projections.\n\nHow the Fed sees price gains and economic activity evolving in 2024 will likely influence bets over the timing of the first cut. According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, there is an almost 50% chance the bank will roll it out in May.\n\n4. China Evergrande ordered to liquidate\n\nChina Evergrande has been ordered to be wound up by a Hong Kong court after the world's most indebted property developer failed to secure a restructuring agreement with its creditors.\n\nThe group, which has over $300 billion in total liabilities, has been attempting to secure the deal for more than two years in the wake of a bond repayment and a series of court hearings.\n\nBut Justice Linda Chan on Monday appointed management consultancy Alvarez&Marsal to liquidate Evergrande, arguing that the move will provide some certainty to creditors. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" Chan said in the morning court session, Reuters reported.\n\nEvergrande's Chief Executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media that the decision will not impact the operations of its onshore and offshore units. But analysts have flagged that the liquidation process could be complicated and lengthy, as well as damaging to already downbeat sentiment around the state of China's property market.\n\nShares in Evergrande slumped by just under 21% after the announcement.\n\n5. Crude volatile amid Middle East turmoil\n\nOil prices were choppy on Monday, as traders fretted over increased disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nBy 05:08 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.4% lower at $77.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $82.68 per barrel. Both contracts had risen earlier in the day.\n\nThe attack, which U.S. President Joe Biden said was carried out by Iran-backed militants, resulted in the death of three American service members. It was the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.\n\nIran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns over a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings, Fed this week; Evergrande ordered to liquidate - what's moving markets\n\nSlovakia looks to buy Patriot air defence system from United States\n\nChina's vice premier urges more support for listed firms amid market rout",

The US economy displayed stronger-than-expected growth in Q4, while annual core inflation was lower than economists' predictions, hinting at a possible slowdown in price hikes. However, the market's gains were somewhat subdued compared to the rally of the week before, following disappointing earnings reports from major companies such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe upcoming week is set to be eventful, with the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting of the year on the agenda, accompanied by significant data releases such as the nonfarm payrolls, ISM Manufacturing PMI, and JOLTs job openings. The Fed is anticipated to keep interest rates at their 23-year high, with investors keen to discern any signals about the timing of rate cuts this year.\n\nOn the data front, it's expected that non-farm payrolls may have increased by 162K in January, a slowdown from the 216K rise in December. The unemployment rate is predicted to remain stable at 3.7% for a second period, while monthly wage growth is likely to ease to 0.3% from 0.4%. The ISM PMI is expected to continue signaling a contraction in the manufacturing sector at the year's start.\n\nInvestors will also be keeping a close eye on the ADP employment change, Q4 labor productivity and employment costs, factory orders, and regional industry indexes such as the Chicago PMI and Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index.\n\nThe ongoing earnings season will continue to make headlines, with a roster of key companies set to report, including tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and others such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX).\n\nStory continues\n\nStay up to date with the latest earnings results using InvestingPro!

        "title": "These 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Hit All-Time Highs on the Same Day. Here's the Better Buy in 2024.",
        "content": "Jan. 23 ended up being a great day for the stock market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs. Three of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks closed at all-time highs as well -- Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) at $398.90 a share, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) at $598.73 a share, and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) at $385.20 per share. The other four Magnificent stocks are Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla.\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia have each set new record highs on multiple occasions already this year. But it took until Jan. 23 for Meta Platforms to exceed its previous record close of $382.18 a share that was set on Sept. 7, 2021. Making it all the more impressive for Meta is that the stock has quadrupled since it fell below $90 a share in early November 2022.\n\nStill, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Let's go through the pros and cons of these three companies to determine which has what it takes to keep the record highs coming and which is the best buy for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms: A more value-oriented Magnificent Seven stock\n\nEven after Meta Platforms' epic 15-month rally, the stock still isn't all that expensive from a valuation standpoint, which goes to show how discounted Meta was and how it should have never sold off as much as it did.\n\nNo matter how you feel about Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or any of Meta's other apps, there is no denying that the company is an absolute cash cow. In fact, Meta has the second-lowest price-to-free cash flow ratio of the Magnificent Seven. META Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nYou can think of Meta's apps as digital real estate. Meta provides some of the most affordable, effective, and measurable ad space out there. The company has done a phenomenal job improving Instagram and monetizing it, which has crushed the doubters who thought it would become irrelevant in the face of TikTok.\n\nMeta would be generating even more cash if it weren't losing billions on Reality Labs, its augmented/virtual reality segment. But that's the advantage of a company like Meta. It can afford to take risks and bleed cash without derailing the business. Very few companies are in the same position.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's a lot to like about Meta as a balanced, more value-orientated Magnificent Seven stock.\n\n2. Nvidia: Blistering growth\n\nNvidia passed $1 trillion in market cap last June and never looked back. Now it's knocking on the door of $1.5 trillion. At this rate, Nvidia could easily pass Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-most-valuable company in the world. It's just a matter of what multiple the market is willing to give it. NVDA Market Cap Chart\n\nThe biggest risk of investing in Nvidia is that so much of its future growth is priced into the stock's current valuation. At a 78.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Nvidia is far from cheap. But the growth is undeniable. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe chart above illustrates an impressive feat from a company. In just one year, Nvidia's sales are up 66.4% and its net income has more than quadrupled. But it's Nvidia's margins that are the real standout. Generating $18.9 billion in net income on $44.9 billion in sales is almost unheard of. Nvidia makes so much profit from each dollar in sales that the company doesn't have to grow sales by that much to make its P/E ratio shrink.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Nvidia has had its downturns. The semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical. Nvidia suffered a fairly major pullback last year. Its margins were crushed, and sales and profits declined. The same thing happened in 2019.\n\nSo why are investors excited now? Well, it has to do with artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia AI accelerator processors power OpenAI's ChatGPT processors, and orders are flowing in as other companies try to hop on the AI train. \"We're at the beginning of a basically across-the-board industrial transition to generative AI to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country,\" said Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang on the company's Q3 2024 earnings call.\n\nNvidia's products have been at the forefront of many trends, including crypto mining, gaming, and professional graphics. If the growth continues, the stock could look cheap. If it slows, the stock is going to look too priced for perfection. Nvidia as a company is doing unbelievably well. Nvidia the stock is extremely expensive.\n\n3. Microsoft: A clear-cut way to capitalize on AI\n\nMicrosoft is experiencing the best parts of both Meta Platforms and Nvidia. Like Meta, Microsoft is a cash cow with a proven business model. And like Nvidia, Microsoft is investing heavily in AI and is already reaping the rewards.\n\nI think of Microsoft as the AI sandbox. It has exposure to different industries, professional services, recreational customers in gaming, applications for school, and everyday life. This sheer number of touchpoints gives Microsoft a steep advantage. It can keep its finger on the pulse of what folks are using while learning what doesn't stick.\n\nAfter all, Microsoft's history is about perfecting sticky products. Microsoft Word wasn't necessarily the best word processor. Excel wasn't the most powerful spreadsheet app. But what Microsoft did better than any other company was package these applications and make them user-friendly.\n\nMaking AI tools too complicated could push away less tech-savvy folk. Microsoft is taking a page out of its old playbook with Copilot, generative AI that is integrated into existing Microsoft applications. It basically acts as an assistant, and makes the applications more useful without making them more complicated.\n\nMicrosoft generates tons of cash that it pours into organic growth, uses to buy back its own stock, and could use to make an acquisition if it wants. Microsoft doesn't have to cross its fingers and hope its customers adopt AI. It can try out different solutions, tweak them over time, and find out what works.\n\nAdd it all up, and Microsoft has arguably the best risk/potential reward profile of any of the Magnificent Seven stocks. And for that reason, I'd buy it over Meta and Nvidia right now, although both of those picks have a lot going for them as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Will Lead the New Bull Market",
        "content": "It's official: A new bull market is here. And part of the reason for that is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis roundtable panel of Motley Fool contributors agrees that AI stocks will lead this new bull market. But will the AI stocks that led the market out of the doldrums and toward the recent highs be the same stocks that will carry the bull market forward? Or will new AI stocks emerge as market leaders? See why Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are top picks now. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nAmazon stands to benefit from the growth of AI\n\nJake Lerch (Amazon): I think 2024 will see a massive transformation for AI, and that's why I'm picking Amazon as the AI stock that will lead this new bull market.\n\nIn short, the commercialization of AI is just starting. Relatively few AI products are available right now, but that's changing rapidly. Microsoft is now offering AI-powered Copilot features in its Office software, CrowdStrike's security modules utilize machine learning to prevent hacking, and Adobe has several multimedia tools that use generative AI. Countless other AI-driven products will soon be available for retail and enterprise customers.\n\nAmazon, the world's largest cloud services provider and the world's largest e-commerce company, should benefit in several ways:\n\nCloud spending could accelerate as businesses ramp up spending on generative AI, which runs on the cloud. And, crucially, cloud spending is one of Amazon's fastest-growing revenue sources. E-commerce spending could get a boost from the rise of AI-driven digital marketing, known as programmatic advertising, which helps advertisers serve better and more targeted ads. More e-commerce spending should lead to higher revenue for Amazon. Robotics innovations could lead to massive cost savings. Amazon is already America's second-largest employer, with over 1.5 million employees. However, it already uses over 750,000 robots in its sprawling warehouse network. Expect more robots -- run by AI -- going forward; that could lead to higher profits for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's enormous scale -- and the diversified nature of its business model (primarily split between e-commerce and the cloud) -- means the company will capture additional revenue as AI technology matures. Moreover, the company's own AI innovations and outside robotics advancements could help the company become more efficient, meaning bigger profits for the company and bigger returns for Amazon shareholders.\n\nThis stock is up over 300% and could continue to soar\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): The social media giant and AI innovator is an obvious pick to lead the new bull market because it's already doing it. The stock bottomed at roughly $90, along with the broader market, in late 2022. It's rallied over 300% since then.\n\nRemarkably, Meta Platforms is arguably still undervalued today. The company found itself in Wall Street's dog house when advertising struggles amid iPhone software changes and frivolous spending cratered Meta's free cash flow between mid-2022 and early 2023. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThe remedy? CEO Mark Zuckerberg aggressively cut expenses and leaned in to AI to counter Meta's iPhone privacy headwinds and get the company's financials back on track. Now, analysts are optimistic again about Meta's future, estimating a 20% long-term average annual earnings growth rate.\n\nThat's an enticing 1.1 PEG ratio, based on the stock's forward P/E of only 22. In other words, Meta's stock was so beaten down at its low that shares are still a bargain despite their meteoric rebound.\n\nAs long as Meta continues performing and can meet analyst estimates, the stock is poised to help lead this new bull market.\n\nInvestors should not forget the AI chip leader\n\nWill Healy(Nvidia): When it comes to AI stocks, one might think they missed out on Nvidia. The semiconductor stock rose by almost 240% in 2023, and with it rising an additional 25% so far in 2024, one might assume its run will plateau in the near future.\n\nDon't be so sure.\n\nAI-capable chips are essential to supporting the technology, and late last year, a Raymond James analyst estimated Nvidia controlled more than 85% of the generative AI accelerator chip market. Admittedly, that success has attracted competitors. Companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have taken notice and seek to take away some of that business with their own lines of AI chips.\n\nNonetheless, with Nvidia's market lead, these companies will probably struggle to challenge its dominance in the near term. Moreover, Allied Market Research estimates a 38% compound annual growth rate in the AI chip market through 2030.\n\nSuch a growth rate makes it easier for Nvidia to shrug off any potential competition, and seems to reinforce the optimism. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29), the company reported $39 billion in revenue, an 86% increase versus year-ago levels.\n\nOver the same time frame, net income exceeded $17 billion, a huge increase from the $3 billion it earned during the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nAdditionally, analysts forecast revenue will grow at 119% during the current fiscal year. Although it is likely to slow down, they predict revenue will rise by an additional 57% in fiscal 2025, indicating the rapid increases will continue.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to the surge in net income, Nvidia's valuation has fallen significantly. Its P/E ratio had exceeded 240 as recently as July. Today, the earnings multiple stands at 81, and its forward P/E ratio has fallen to 50.\n\nAs long as net income continues to skyrocket, these multiples will likely decline further, making the burgeoning AI-driven opportunity in Nvidia stock a much safer choice.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Simple Reason Why Nvidia Stock Could Keep Crushing the Market",
        "content": "It is no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) has supercharged Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) in recent quarters, triggering eye-popping growth in the company's revenue and earnings as tech giants race to get their hands on its graphics processing units (GPUs) for training and powering AI models.\n\nThis explains why buyers face wait times of 36 weeks to 52 weeks to get delivery of Nvidia's AI-focused A100 and H100 processors. But it is worth noting that the semiconductor specialist is looking to aggressively increase production of its AI GPUs, which is why customers such as Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) are expecting to get their hands on much larger numbers of those chips this year.\n\nAccording to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant expects its arsenal of Nvidia's flagship H100 graphics cards to hit 350,000 units by the end of 2024. Market research firm Omdia estimates that Meta received 150,000 H100s in 2023. If that estimate is accurate, Zuckerberg's remarks indicate that Meta expects to receive an additional 200,000 units of this processor in 2024.\n\nThat would be a 33% increase over last year. This indicates Nvidia's capacity expansion efforts are likely to drive stronger growth for the company this year, which may be enough to help it outperform Wall Street's expectations.\n\nNvidia is consistently raising its AI GPU capacity\n\nOmdia estimates that Nvidia sold an estimated 500,000 of its flagship H100 AI graphics cards in 2023's third quarter. That was an impressive 67% improvement over the estimated shipments of 300,000 H100 GPUs in the second quarter.\n\nThe market research firm forecast that shipments of Nvidia's H100 processors would exceed 500,000 units in the final quarter of 2023. That won't be surprising, as its foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) (popularly known as TSMC), has been boosting its advanced chip packaging capacity so that it can produce greater quantities of Nvidia's AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC reportedly increased its advanced chip packaging capacity by an estimated 25% to 66% in 2023 to a range of 15,000 to 20,000 wafers per month. It was earlier manufacturing 12,000 wafers a month. With Nvidia reportedly making use of 60% of the Taiwan-based foundry giant's capacity, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia shipping more than 500,000 units of the H100 in Q4 2023.\n\nAssuming the company ships 600,000 H100 processors in Q4 (a 20% increase over the Q3 number), its total shipments of this chip in the final three quarters of 2023 would land at 1.4 million units. Given that Nvidia started shipping the H100 in the first quarter of 2023, we can assume that it may have ended the year with shipments of 1.5 million units. That's nearly triple what some were expecting the company to ship last year.\n\nThis explains why Nvidia has been comprehensively beating Wall Street's earnings estimates over the past couple of quarters. In the second quarter of its fiscal 2024, Nvidia delivered $2.70 per share in adjusted earnings, topping analysts' consensus estimate of $2.09 per share. This was followed by $4.02 per share in adjusted earnings in its fiscal third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), significantly exceeding the analysts' $3.37 per share estimate.\n\nThese impressive earnings beats help explain why Nvidia stock has surged by 233% in the past year. And it could continue to deliver stronger bottom-line growth given the capacity expansions of its foundry partner.\n\nNvidia's shipment capacity could continue increasing in 2024\n\nTSMC is expected to boost its advanced chip packaging capacity to 30,000 wafers a month in the second quarter. According to other estimates, the foundry giant could end the year with a capacity of 35,000 wafers a month. So TSMC is likely to more than double its capacity for manufacturing AI chips in 2024. That's why we can assume that Nvidia could witness a significant increase in its revenue and earnings in its new fiscal year, which begins next month.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia's revenue to increase by 57% in fiscal 2025 to $93 billion. Its earnings are expected to jump 67% to $20.56 per share. For comparison, they predict that Nvidia will close out fiscal 2024 with revenue of $59 billion, a 118% increase over the prior year. Its bottom line is forecast to increase by a whopping 268% to $12.30 per share.\n\nIf TSMC indeed doubles its output and Nvidia continues to absorb 60% of the foundry giant's advanced packaging capacity, it won't be surprising to see the graphics specialist repeat its fiscal 2024 performance and blow away Wall Street's expectations. That's why investors would do well to buy Nvidia right away, considering that it is trading at just 29 times forward earnings, a nice discount to its five-year forward earnings multiple of 42.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Superstar investor Cathie Wood is known for betting on innovators no matter what the market is doing. She reinforced her bets on certain declining stocks even as they struggled in the bear market because she focuses on the long term. At the same time, Wood also will pick up rising stocks if they still are fairly valued considering future prospects -- a stock that's climbed still may represent a bargain.\n\nWood's tenacity paid off last year, when her flagship Ark Innovation fund advanced 67%, outperforming the S&P 500. In the new bull market, this top investor, with her focus on growth stocks, also might continue to win. What is she buying these days? In her latest search for bargains this past week, she added to some of her favorite positions. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. CRISPR Therapeutics\n\nWood is a big fan of the promise of gene editing, and CRISPR Therapeutics(NASDAQ: CRSP) is leading the way in this potentially game-changing field. The company recently scored the world's first authorization of a CRISPR-based gene editing therapy when the U.K. gave Casgevy the nod. U.S. regulators also recently approved Casgevy for blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.\n\nWhat makes gene editing so exciting is that by fixing faulty genes responsible for disease, it results in functional cures. For example, those who go for Casgevy receive a one-time treatment and then should go on to live their lives, symptom-free.\n\nCasgevy has blockbuster potential, but CRISPR Therapeutics shares profit with partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Still, any revenue from this first commercialized product is great news and should help CRISPR Therapeutics advance its pipeline. And the biotech has a solid financial situation, with more than $1.9 billion in cash. Finally, a regulatory nod for a CRISPR-based product is good news as it serves as a vote of confidence in the technology -- a technology the biotech uses across its pipeline.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics shares have climbed, but they're trading at much lower levels than they were a few years ago when we had a lot less visibility on whether the company would be able to bring a product to market.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is a social media giant, with Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads rounding out its family of apps. Together, they attracted 3.96 billion monthly active users in the third quarter, an increase of 7% year over year.\n\nConsidering the dominance of these social media apps, it's hard to imagine a rival easily unseating Meta. And this is great news because Meta generates most of its revenue through selling advertising to people and businesses aiming to reach the users of these platforms. In the quarter, revenue climbed in the double digits to more than $34 billion.\n\nThis market strength is something that probably caught Wood's eye, but she also likely appreciates Meta's commitment to investing in a top area of innovation: artificial intelligence (AI). In the latest earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said the company's biggest investment area this year will be AI, in engineering and compute resources.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs business, meant to develop metaverse and AI projects, remains a small part of the company's revenue picture, but it could position Meta for a win down the road if these technologies take off.\n\nIn spite of recent gains, Meta shares still trade for only 22 times forward earnings estimates, a bargain for this market leader and innovator.\n\n3. Ginkgo Bioworks\n\nGinkgo Bioworks(NYSE: DNA), as a potential game-changer in the biopharma industry, is one of the top positions -- No. 11 out of 43 holdings -- in Cathie Wood's healthcare fund. The company engineers cells to help power projects in many areas, from agriculture to pharmaceuticals. But it's in the biotech and pharma industry that this company could potentially transform the way things are done, speeding up the discovery of drugs. Ginkgo's foundries design and test organisms at scale, so that companies can more quickly identify promising candidates.\n\nThe time and cost of drug discovery is one of the biggest challenges faced by the industry, so it's no surprise pharma clients are starting to flock to Ginkgo. The company last year signed deals with big pharma players including Pfizer and Merck. Pfizer will use Ginkgo's platform to help in the discovery of RNA molecules, and Merck will use the technology to improve its manufacturing of biologics.\n\nGinkgo's pharma and biotech programs doubled over the past two years, today representing 36% of the company's total active programs. The industry now is Ginkgo's biggest customer, with the greatest percentage of total active programs among five industries. And Ginkgo's pharma and biotech revenue climbed more than 50% last year. So, this represents a key area of growth for Ginkgo.\n\nThe company has invested more than $1 billion in its technology, from automation to data assets and AI models, with the aim of helping biopharma companies benefit from economies of scale. If Ginkgo makes this happen, the stock, trading for less than $2 today, could skyrocket.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead",
        "content": "Investing.com -- It’s set to be an action-packed week in markets with the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, a flurry of big tech earnings and the latest U.S. jobs report. The Bank of England also holds its first policy meeting of 2024 while data out of China is expected to remain gloomy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.\n\nFed ahead\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.\n\nInvestors have pushed expectations for the Fed’s first rate cut to May from March following recent strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that cuts may not be as aggressive as expected.\n\nData on Friday indicated that inflation is moderating but consumer spending remains robust, leading to concerns that price pressures could begin to mount again.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post policy meeting press conference for any insights into how officials have been interpreting recent economic data.\n\nJobs report\n\nHard on the heels of the Fed decision the U.S. is to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.\n\nThe recent stock market rally which has powered the S&P 500 to record highs has been driven by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.\n\nA weaker than expected reading could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe economic calendar also includes data on JOLTS job openings and consumer confidence on Tuesday, followed a day later by a report on private sector payrolls and weekly data on initial jobless claims on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nMegacap earnings\n\nEarnings will be a major focal point in the week ahead with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.\n\nWith the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum.\n\nCollectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.\n\n\"There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Reuters. \"If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose\" for the market as a whole.\n\nBank of England\n\nThe BoE is expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday and while it may drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds it is expected to indicate that rates need to remain restrictive for an extended period.\n\nThe latest U.K. jobs report showed that wage growth rose at the slowest pace in almost a year in the three months to November, but inflation unexpectedly rose to 4% in December.\n\nBritain's economy started 2024 on a stronger footing but data last week indicated that supply disruptions in the Red Sea are reigniting inflation in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe BoE raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023, taking rates to a peak of 5.25% after inflation surged to a 41-year high of 11.1% in late 2022.\n\nChina PMIs\n\nChina is to release official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday that is likely to show that the world’s second largest economy remains on a shaky footing.\n\nChina's economy expanded by 5.2% in 2023, but its post-pandemic recovery has been shaky, with a protracted housing downturn, mounting deflationary risks and slowing global growth casting clouds over the outlook for this year.\n\nChina's central bank announced last Wednesday that it was making a 50-basis point cut to bank reserves, the biggest in two years, sending a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and the country's plunging stock markets.\n\nStill, analysts say more stimulus is needed this year to get economic activity on more solid footing.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nUS reviewing Venezuelan sanctions policy in wake of court decision - State Dept\n\nFrench farmers keep Paris roadblock threat as protests endure",

        "title": "Nvidia Is Selling $10 Billion in GPUs to This AI Tech Giant (Hint: It's Not Microsoft)",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price has more than quadrupled over the past three years. Most of that rally was driven by the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, where its data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks.\n\nTwo of its better-known customers are OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and its top backer Microsoft. However, Meta(NASDAQ: META) has also been spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's data center GPUs every year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThat's why it wasn't all that surprising when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said his company would install 350,000 of Nvidia's top-tier H100 GPUs in its data centers by the end of 2024. Zuckerberg didn't disclose how many H100s Meta had purchased so far, but Nvidia only launched the GPU with a limited supply in late 2022.\n\nNvidia is currently selling the H100 for $25,000 to $30,000 each, according to analysts at Raymond James, which implies that Meta will probably spend roughly $8.8 billion to $10.5 billion on Nvidia's GPUs over a two-year period. Let's see why that's a bright green flag for Nvidia -- and what it tells us about Meta's near-term challenges and longer-term plans.\n\nWhy Meta's support is great news for Nvidia\n\nNvidia generated $29.1 billion in revenue, or 75% of its top line, from its data center chips in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, which started last January. That's up from 52% of its total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.\n\nThe bulls believe this business will continue expanding as the AI market grows, but the bears expect the AI market to cool off and for new competitors to enter the ring. Meta's big GPU purchases counter those bearish claims in two ways.\n\nFirst, Meta probably wouldn't spend about $10 billion -- equivalent to about 17% of its combined capital expenditures (capex) of $31 billion in 2023 and $28 billion in projected capex for 2024 -- on Nvidia's H100 GPUs if it thought the AI market was cooling off. Instead, the social media giant probably expects that market to heat up as cloud leaders including Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google expand their own AI ecosystems.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Precedence Research, the broader AI market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% from 2023 to 2032. Fortune Business Insights expects the generative AI niche to expand at an even faster CAGR of 47.5%. Providing the building blocks for that booming market could drive Nvidia's stock a lot higher.\n\nSecond, Meta allays some concerns that Nvidia's largest customers will replace its GPUs with their own in-house chips. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have all been developing their own AI chips, but their ongoing purchases of Nvidia's GPUs suggest it could still be years before they produce comparable chips. Instead, their custom chips will probably work in tandem with Nvidia's GPUs to process AI tasks for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat Meta's GPU purchases tell us about its future\n\nBut for Meta, its massive purchases of Nvidia's GPUs raise some questions about its future. It's still burning billions of dollars on the expansion of its Reality Labs segment, which racked up steep operating losses of $13.7 billion in 2022 and $11.5 billion in the first nine months of 2023 as it rolled out new augmented and virtual reality devices. Its big GPU purchases from Nvidia could exacerbate that pressure -- which already reduced its operating margin from 41% in 2019 to 25% in 2022.\n\nMeta's revenue growth accelerated throughout 2023 as its core advertising business recovered, but that recovery was mainly driven by Chinese e-commerce marketplaces including PDD's Temu and Shein, which ramped up their spending on Meta's platforms to promote their products to overseas customers. If those companies rein in their ad purchases as Meta increases its spending on the expansion of its data centers and Reality Labs segment, its operating margin will shrink again.\n\nBut over the long term, Meta's data center investments could pay off by making its AI algorithms more effective at crafting targeted ads, figuring out which Reels keep viewers engaged, and calculating the best prices for its programmatic ads. Meta's collection of first-party data should also completely eliminate its dependence on Apple, which cut off Facebook and Instagram from its third-party iOS data with a major update in 2021.\n\nIt's good news for both companies\n\nMeta's commitment to Nvidia indicates that the chipmaker will remain a linchpin of the AI market for years to come. It should boost Nvidia's data center GPU sales and widen Meta's own moat against other ad-driven tech giants such as Google. Simply put, this big GPU purchase is great news for both companies -- although Nvidia will initially generate more sales growth from that deal at the expense of Meta's near-term margins.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Many believe there are many opportunities for under-the-radar stocks and investors should look beyond just the mega-cap tech stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM).\n\nLong-term investors are always on the lookout for bargains in the market since there are always companies that are trading below their intrinsic value. As the legendary value investor Seth Klarman said long ago in one of his letters to investors, value investing outperforms when everything else in the market is not working:\n\n\"I must remind you that value investing is not designed to outperform in a bull market. In a bull market, anyone, with any investment strategy or none at all, can do well, often better than value investors. It is only in a bear market that the value investing discipline becomes especially important because value investing, virtually alone among strategies, gives you exposure to the upside with limited downside risk. In a stormy market, the value investing discipline becomes crucial, because it helps you find your bearings when reassuring landmarks are no longer visible. In a market downturn, momentum investors cannot find momentum, growth investors worry about a slowdown, and technical analysts don't like their charts. But the value investing discipline tells you exactly what to analyze, price versus value, and then what to do, buy at a considerable discount and sell near full value. And, because you cannot tell what the market is going to do, a value investment discipline is important because it is the only approach that produces consistently good investment results over a complete market cycle.\"\n\nStory continues Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Kaleidico on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that are trading near or at their 52-week lows.

        "title": "Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX): A Metaverse Stock Investors Shouldn’t Forget",
        "content": "As Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) battle their way into the Metaverse, it’s easy to forget about Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX), a metaverse play that’s already proven how lucrative the market can be, especially for young audiences. Indeed, the Metaverse is more about gaming or work. Roblox’s platform has shown us just how profound digital “experiences” can be and how a metaverse-like universe can connect us in ways we never thought possible.\n\nAs the Metaverse term looks to make its way to the top of headlines (again) in 2024, Roblox will be a stock to watch as it looks to climb out of the ditch it fell into back in late 2021 and early 2022. At this juncture, Wall Street is just mildly optimistic about the firm’s prospects over the year ahead. Personally, I think Wall Street is a tad too cautious on Roblox stock, given the potential for the Metaverse to make a significant comeback in the new year as Apple looks to test the market with its Vision Pro headset.\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine many folks underestimating metaverse plays like Roblox this year. As the company looks to add to its ecosystem in 2024, I can’t help but stay bullish on the stock.\n\nRoblox’s Recent Momentum Can Continue, as Metaverse Hype Can Grow Again\n\nIndeed, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest of the hot tech trends over the past year, and while it seems tough to top, I think the Metaverse could re-emerge as a theme that attracts some of the investors who believe gen AI has gotten a tad too ahead of itself.\n\nApple’s massive user base will begin to explore an all-new medium (augmented and virtual reality), which could prove the successor of personal computers. Whether Roblox will be quick to launch a Vision Pro app remains to be seen, as many firms seem to be holding out in these initial stages. Regardless, I’d not discount the power of Roblox as the Metaverse investment theme looks to heat up again.\n\nJust last week, Roth MKM reiterated its Buy rating on shares of RBLX (with a $50.00 price target, implying 23.7% upside), citing their belief that the year could be “bright” for the firm. Roth analysts Eric Handler and Rohit Kulkarni both like the stock and its “very attractive setup” that could beef up bookings growth from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nI’m in agreement. Handler and Kulkarni really do understand Roblox’s growth narrative. With many growth and monetization levers to pull, it’s likely a mistake to think Roblox stock is destined for another year of consolidation.\n\nRoblox stock has been on a nice run since bottoming out in autumn, with shares now up around 60% from their 52-week lows of approximately $25 per share. Even with the recent 13% correction off 52-week highs, Roblox still looks incredibly intriguing if you’re in the belief that the Metaverse trend could return to the spotlight again while the company does its best to get its wheels fully back on the growth track.\n\nRoblox Has a Wide Moat, but There are Competitors Out There\n\nRoblox’s ecosystem is impressive and acts as a flywheel for growth as more users create content to win over the engagement of fellow players. With many different worlds and experiences available to players, the possibilities of digital places to hang out with friends are virtually endless. Roblox isn’t the only video game firm to implement such a model, though.\n\nFortnite is an incredibly popular Battle Royale game that’s become quite Roblox-like with recent updates. With a wide selection of user-generated worlds and games, Fortnite stands out as a potential threat that could take a big chunk of Roblox’s lunch, especially from older gaming audiences.\n\nFortunately, Roblox is doing its best to stay relevant with its users, even as they grow up. Though industry dynamics are sure to shift with every new industry combatant, I’d not be so quick to count Roblox out of the game.\n\nIn a prior piece, I highlighted the importance of maintaining attraction with users as they age. Thus far, Roblox has done a reasonable job, but whether it can outcompete ever-strengthening rivals for engagement remains to be seen.\n\nIs RBLX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, RBLX stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 22 analyst ratings, there are 15 Buys, four Hold recommendations, and three Sell recommendations. The average RBLX stock price target is $44.74, implying upside potential of 10.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $21.00 per share to a high of $55.00 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Roblox Stock\n\nThere’s a lot to love about Roblox stock as the Metaverse looks to reappear in the limelight this year. Though Roblox has numerous levers it can pull to gain traction in 2024, investors must also keep tabs on rivals as more companies recognize the economic profits to be had in the realm of the Metaverse and its like.\n\nDisclosure",

(TMUS) TMUS stock\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nT-Mobile US Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an American telecommunications titan, serving the nation with its wireless network services and mobile devices, empowering over 100 million satisfied customers. As the third-largest mobile network operator in the country, T-Mobile has a significant market presence, reflected in its $191.0 billion market cap and a year-over-year net income growth of 36%.\n\nThe U.S. telecom market is valued at $443.12 billion as of 2024 and is projected to continue growing at a CAGR of 3.67% during the forecast period of 2024-2029. T-Mobile’s financials back up the company’s secure position. Total service revenues increased 3% year-over-year to $16 billion in Q4 2023 and 3% year-over-year to $63.2 billion in 2023, along with a 10% increase in Core Adjusted EBITDA YoY to $29.1 billion in 2023. With adjusted free cash flow almost doubling YoY, an industry-leading 1.6 million postpaid net customer additions, and increasingly widening profit margins, TMUS holds large growth potential both in terms of profitability and increasing customer base.\n\nRecent boosts in TMUS’s performance have been propelled largely by the introduction and adoption of 5G and related technologies. Boasting the largest nationwide 5G network covering 98% of Americans, T-Mobile stands as a clear leader in the 5G revolution. We expect trends to continue in terms of T-Mobile’s expansion and expect to see jumps in revenue and stock performance, marking it as a Strong Buy as far as telecom stocks go.\n\nStory continues\n\nComcast Corporation (CMCSA) Image of the Comcast (CMCSA) logo on the back of a white van in a rural area\n\nSource: Todd A. Merport / Shutterstock.com\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is an American-stationed national broadcast service and network. As the parent corporation for blockbuster technological companies such as Xfinity, NBC, Universal Studios, and more, Comcast holds resilient market dominance which dictated its $45.27 valuation and a YoY growth of 12.89%.\n\nComcast’s 2023 financial standings implicate success in the future. In Q3 2023, CMCSA acquired $30.12 billion in revenue, marking marginal YoY increases of 0.89%. However, growth prospects and large margin YoY growth are apparent in both net income and diluted EPS, accounting for YoY increases of 187.99% and 193.33% respectively. With profit margins widening, CMCSA holds growing potential for improvements in nationwide coverage. Further, the preliminary Q4 earnings call notes that CMCSA beat both forecasts for EPS and revenue.\n\nLargely, recent jumps in performance by Comcast’s subgroup of Peacock Streaming propelled its recent valuation. In Q4 2023, Peacock increased its subscriber count by 3 million accounts, amounting to a total user base increase of over 10%. With the success of Peacock this past quarter, Comcast has begun to stifle the income losses associated with the streaming website. As Comcast expands coverage of Peacock and incorporates new media and catalogs, expect revenue to continue to climb in conjunction with CMCSA valuation.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a multinational conglomerate that owns and operates Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Currently trading at $393.18, the stock is up 177.87% YoY. Fifty-four analysts are bullish on the stock with a median 12-month price target of $398.50.\n\nIn Q3 2023, Meta reported revenue of $34.15 billion, up 23% YoY. Net income rose 164% to $11.58 billion, largely due to its fast digital ads business growth. With Meta estimated to have held 20.8% of all U.S. digital ad sales in 2023, the ads market is the core of its business. The global market for digital advertising was valued at $628.8 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2027. Exhibiting a CAGR of 14.7% during the forecast period, this provides ample room for Meta to grow. Looking forward, management expects future success with revenue forecasted to be between $36.5-$40 billion in Q4 2023.\n\nFinally, Meta hopes to boost its growth by investing in AI. Recently, Zuckerberg announced the company’s plans to purchase billions of dollars worth of Nvidia chips, including 350,000 H100 graphics cards, to create a massive computing infrastructure. The company plans to use this infrastructure to pursue research related to artificial general intelligence (AGI), a futuristic form of AI also being researched by OpenAI and Google’s Deep Mind Unit. Zuckerberg described this move as a “long-term vision” to give Meta a strategic edge.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The rapid increase in this number since receiving regulatory approval in August signifies the attractiveness of Baidu’s offerings in the market.\n\nAlso, Baidu’s assertion that ERNIE is handling tens of millions of queries daily, with a significant portion coming from the Baidu family of products, underlines the integration of AI-native applications into its existing offerings.\n\nFinally, introducing generated business intelligence exemplifies Baidu’s focus on providing innovative solutions for enterprises.\n\nThis is one of the blue-chip stocks that is positioned for long-term growth.\n\nStoneCo (STNE) a credit card reader with a credit card in it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStoneCo’s (NASDAQ:STNE) priority was to expand its financial services business.\n\nThere is a significant growth in Micro, Small, and Medium Businesses’ total payment volume, which increased by 20% year-over-year, more than twice the industry rate.\n\nThe MSMB client base also saw a substantial increase of 42% year-over-year, reaching almost 3.3 million merchants.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, StoneCo demonstrated advancements in banking and credit solutions. The banking active client base increased to 1.9 million, with R$4.5 billion in deposits. The expansion of the credit portfolio to R$113 million in the quarter indicates the successful execution of the strategy in developing the platform and client engagement.\n\nNotably, StoneCo’s other priority is to “grow with efficiency.” The company has delivered positive results in this aspect. The total revenue has increased by 25% year-over-year, reaching R$3.1 billion. This exceeded the guidance by 2%, showcasing the company’s ability to generate substantial top-line growth.\n\nOverall, the increase in total revenue shows StoneCo’s strength in expanding its market presence and capturing a larger share of the payment solutions industry. This growth, coupled with efficient operations, focuses on the company’s focus on achieving its priorities.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters\n\nPayPal’s (NASDAQ:PYPL) TPV growth is a fundamental strength, a key payment industry metric reflecting the total value of transactions processed through a platform.\n\nDriving forces contributing to the reported 15% growth in TPV (Q3 2023), including the role of specific products like Braintree, provide a granular view of PayPal’s transactional dynamics.\n\nIn numbers, a 10% growth in the US TPV and an accelerated 19% growth in the international TPV, focusing on Europe and Asia, help understand regional performance disparities and opportunities.\n\nWhile active accounts declined by 2.8 million, intentionally removing low-quality customers was a contributing factor.\n\nAlso, transaction revenue grew by 7% to $6.7 billion, with notable contributions from Braintree and PayPal-branded checkout. Lastly, other value-added services revenue experienced substantial growth, reaching 25% and totaling $764 million.\n\nVerizon (VZ) 5G stocks, VZ stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon’s (NYSE:VZ) business unit performance, particularly in consumer mobility and broadband, underscores the effectiveness of its strategic focus on key growth areas.\n\nThe attainment of sequential and year-over-year improvement in postpaid phone net adds to consumer mobility and demonstrates the success of its differentiated approach.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction and success of myPlan, a personalized experience offering value, choice, and control to customers, have contributed to the growth in postpaid phone calls.\n\nThe company can adapt to market trends, such as the iPhone 15 launch, and execute to meet customer needs. Meanwhile, the company maintains a disciplined approach reflecting Verizon’s agility in responding to market dynamics.\n\nFinally, the broadband segment’s performance was marked by over 400K new subscribers (Q3 2023) for the fourth consecutive quarter. This further illustrates Verizon’s success in capturing the growing demand for high-speed internet services.\n\nHence, delivering a reliable and high-performance broadband experience positions Verizon to derive value from growth.\n\nAT&T (T) A photo of an AT&T office building.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T’s (NYSE:T) focus on fiber is another crucial aspect contributing to its growth. For Fiber Customer Growth, delivering nearly 300K high-quality net adds in Q3 2023 is vital.\n\nAlso, there is significant growth in fiber average revenue per user (up nearly 9% YoY), which suggests AT&T is leading in promoting higher-value fiber plans.\n\nAgainst the interest rates, net debt is reduced by more than $3 billion in Q3. This is on track to achieve the 2.5 times net debt to an adjusted EBITDA target by H1 2025, a significant financial attainment.\n\nThe company is on track to reach 200 million people or more with mid-band 5G spectrum by the end of the year. This showcases AT&T’s focus on 5G network expansion. Expanding fiber to 16 million customer locations and reaching 30 million by 2025 present a growth opportunity.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnphase Energy’s (NASDAQ:ENPH) supply chain is a vital fundamental. Shipments from three US contract manufacturers suggest a diversified and robust supply chain.\n\nThe company will ship approximately 1 million microinverters from US manufacturing facilities in Q4 2023. This signifies scalability and the ability to meet increasing demand.\n\nBatteries, particularly the IQ batteries, plan to bring manufacturing to the US by mid-2024, highlighting Enphase’s forward-looking approach. The focus on manufacturing capacity and global expansion positions the company in a favorable position for future market trends.\n\nAt the top line, Enphase Energy’s revenue mix reveals a 64% contribution from the US market and a 36% contribution from international markets in Q3. Despite a sequential decrease in US revenue, the company shows resilience through its global diversification strategy.\n\nThe market entry into the UK, Sweden, Denmark, and Greece and plans for further expansion signifies a proactive approach to tapping into new opportunities.\n\nFinally, the entry into Australia, where revenue more than doubled year-on-year, shows successful product launches and market penetration. Further, there are efforts to introduce IQ micro inverters and batteries in Brazil, India, and other emerging markets.\n\nTherefore, this signifies Enphase’s focus on reaching untapped regions and leveraging the potential for residential solar growth.\n\nMeta (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nReels, as a feature on Instagram, have emerged as a significant driver of user engagement and monetization for Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThe 40% increase in time spent on Instagram since the launch of Reels underscores its success in captivating user attention. This feature’s ability to contribute to the overall ad revenue reaches a net-neutral status, proving its impact on Meta’s monetization strategy.\n\nReels’s lead lies in its ability to capture user interest and evolve from an early initiative to a core part of Meta’s apps. The platform’s adaptability and responsiveness to user behavior exemplify Meta’s capacity to introduce features that resonate with its user base.\n\nThere is a continuous focus on Reels and plans for further ad performance and interactivity improvement. Thus, this indicates Meta’s focus on maximizing the revenue potential of this feature.\n\nThe decision not to quantify the net revenue contribution from Reels in the future implies that Meta views Reels as an integral part of the overall user experience rather than a standalone revenue source.\n\nTherefore, this strategic perspective aligns with Meta’s broader goal of balancing engagement and revenue growth across its product lines.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PYPL, VZ, T, ENPH and META.

        "title": "Big Tech Announces Another Round of Job Cuts As It Continues Its Expensive Efforts To Turn GenAI Into Business Magic",
        "content": "According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) hold the highest cash and short-term investment balances among nonbanking companies in the S&P 500 community. Although they are not hurting cash-wise, they are also quite careful about their spending.\n\nAmazon and Google-parent Alphabet entered the new year by announcing more layoffs. Last year, Amazon, Google, along with Microsoft, Meta and Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM), trimmed their respective workforces by 6% to 13%, but layoffs started back in 2022, costing several thousand employees their jobs.\n\nNew Round Of Layoffs Suggests Big Tech Bit Off More It Can Chew\n\nLast week, Google announced its job cuts across engineering and hardware teams as it continues its push for greater efficiency. Although other parts of the tech giant were affected, mostly impacted were workers in hardware, central engineering and Google Assistant voice-activated software product. As it continues to keep up with its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon, Google eliminated about 12,000 jobs last year under the leadership of Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud titan, Amazon laid off hundreds across Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios divisions, taking the overall job cuts to 27,000. Last year alone, Amazon laid off about 18,000 employees.\n\nCutting Jobs To Fund AI Efforts\n\nAlthough it seems like a strange time for job cuts considering that Big Tech ended 2023 by exiting the post-pandemic slump with the recovery of online advertising, Big Tech is in an expensive arms race to build AI services. Therefore, it is not a surprise that Google and Amazon opted to continue the trend of cost-cutting efforts, while streamlining operations and focusing on key projects. But even though this year will bring increased AI spending, its impact on revenue will likely be limited. Although generative AI is expected to pay out big-time, but turning GenAI magic into the desired top and bottom-line business impact will take time. Microsoft gained the early lead in the AI-race thanks to its partnership with the ChatGPT creator, OpenAI, but Amazon and Google are determined to catch up and to do so, they will need to spend their billions wisely.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Millionaire Makers: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Transform Your Portfolio",
        "content": "With how widespread artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming, every investor needs some exposure to the trend. This doesn't necessarily mean buying the newest or hottest AI company on the block, since several mature companies are big players in this space.\n\nWhile none of these companies will make you a millionaire on their own (unless you invest a massive lump sum into one of them), they are likely to accelerate your path to becoming a millionaire by beating the market by a few percentage points each year.\n\nSo, if you want to add some AI exposure, look at these three stocks.\n\n1. UiPath\n\nOne of the more popular tech investing firms is Cathie Wood's Ark Invest. It might have missed some investments, but it has nailed it on others.\n\nUiPath (NYSE: PATH) is one of the picks they got right, and with the stock making up nearly 6% of Ark's total holdings (its third-largest position overall), it has been a great pick.\n\nUiPath specializes in robotic process automation (RPA) -- software that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. While this technology isn't AI in its own right, the company incorporates AI to make its platform more versatile by mining information from communications or other processes. It even has an AI product that monitors tasks to pinpoint what other processes can be automated.\n\nThis software is very popular, and UiPath's annual recurring revenue (ARR) rose 24% to $1.38 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Oct. 31).\n\nAnd it should only get much bigger. Polaris Market Research set the global RPA opportunity at $2.7 billion in 2022 and projected it to rise to $66.1 billion by 2032. UiPath is poised to capture that significant market expansion.\n\nBut this doesn't mean the stock comes at a steep price. It can be bought for just 11 times sales, far cheaper than many AI software companies.\n\nIf you're looking for an AI company with plenty of growth potential that can be purchased at a reasonable price, UiPath is your stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Adobe\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) is much more mature, but that doesn't stop it from innovating. It is known for its creative design suite and e-commerce tools, but it's also starting to get into generative AI.\n\nIts most notable product is Adobe Firefly, which generates AI images with a simple text input. This allows quick image modification, which can tailor an ad to a specific target or keep a website fresh.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (ending Dec. 1) grew 12% year over year to $5.1 billion, and earnings per share rose 29% thanks to share buybacks.\n\nIt isn't the cheapest stock around, trading for 34 times forward earnings, but it's a proven company that has delivered market-beating returns year after year.\n\nI feel comfortable adding Adobe to my portfolio as an AI stock that doesn't necessarily need AI to work as an investment.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), formerly Facebook, has been trying to diversify its revenue stream from just advertising (the primary form of revenue from its social media sites Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Threads).\n\nThis led it to venture into the metaverse. This hasn't worked out yet, but some of its AI concepts could.\n\nMeta is a leader in using AI to seamlessly translate languages, allowing anyone to understand what someone anywhere in the world is saying.\n\nIt's also working on a mixed-reality product that would allow AI to help train people to do new tasks. Some examples Meta gives are learning how to cook, play tennis, or create pottery. An application like this would have widespread uses and could be the holy grail the company sought in its Reality Labs division.\n\nBut Meta is still just an advertising company. Fortunately, this industry is looking to recover throughout 2024, and the third quarter was already a sign of that. Revenue rose 23% year over year, powering earnings-per-share growth of 168% to $4.39.\n\nThe stock might look somewhat expensive from a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, but its forward P/E is quite cheap. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nA forward P/E of 22 is a great price for a company with the upside of Meta, and like UiPath and Adobe, it doesn't need its AI technologies to work out to be a great investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and UiPath wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "The metaverse, a longstanding concept, is gaining traction in the world of technology stocks. Consisting of interconnected platforms, it enables real-time communication and interaction. The key goal of the metaverse is to merge the virtual and real. For example, users can shop for products or attend concerts in the digital world.\n\nThe metaverse buzz has surged among public companies, with a surge in mentions during quarterly conference calls following Facebook’s rebranding into Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). CEO Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the future of the internet, hence this radical change\n\nNumerous firms are eager to align themselves with the metaverse narrative, reflecting the growing significance of this concept. Meta’s push into the metaverse has triggered a broader corporate interest, as companies recognize the transformative potential of this emerging space on their stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP), the parent company of Snapchat, invests significantly in virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality (AR) software development. While this social media company may not dominate the metaverse hardware arena, it has adopted a unique approach.\n\nSnap allocates significant resources to research and development, constituting its most substantial operating expense. A substantial share of this investment focuses on advancing its VR and AR software capabilities.\n\nIn the landscape of metaverse stocks, superior VR and AR content is pivotal. Given Snap’s financial commitment to content development, its technology stands a solid chance of widespread utilization within the metaverse.\n\nAdditionally, Snap recently hit a 15-month high, a level not seen since July 2022, likely fueled by Wall Street’s bullish sentiment from the rebounding ad market.\n\nBut the social media company had already experienced an impressive year even before the analyst upgrades. Snapchat+ had over 5 million subscribers at the end of the Q3 of 2023. The number of daily active users was 406 million in Q3, an increase of 43 million, or 12%, year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Google’s parent company, primarily generates revenue through its advertising business. The majority of earnings come from Google Ads, encompassing search, display and video advertising. Moreover, Alphabet profits from cloud services and hardware products like Pixel and Nest. This diversification contributes to Alphabet’s financial strength and market influence.\n\nAlong these lines, Google has aimed for years to enter the mixed reality sector, exploring new products for user engagement and how to further diversify away from Search. Google Glass, its initial AR device, faced public disappointment, and subsequent VR products lost traction.\n\nDespite setbacks, Google envisioned facial interaction as the next frontier in computing. In 2020, a new team formed, leading to “Project Iris,” AR spectacles challenging bulkier headsets. Acquiring startups North and Raxium, Google encountered technical challenges, discontinuing Iris.\n\nThe company also has “Project Moohan,” which is a headset developed in collaboration with Samsung. Google aims for an AR glasses platform by repurposing Iris’ software, competing with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta despite internal frustrations and leadership challenges.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor company\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the three leading metaverse stocks, Qualcomm Technologies (NASDAQ:QCOM) made a significant push into the extended reality (XR) realm with its Snapdragon XR technologies. Comprising top-tier processors, software, perception technologies and developer tools, the chipmaker’s XR solutions open doors to robust possibilities for enterprise and consumers alike.\n\nBoasting high-performance, low-power computing, and the integration of 5G and AI, XR holds strong potential surpassing the combined impact of PCs and smartphones. The aim of the Snapdragon XR platforms is to replicate intricate details perceivable by the human eye.\n\nMost recently, Qualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 Platform, a cutting-edge chip designed for VR and AR. According to media reports, Google and Samsung Electronics are set to integrate this advanced chip into their immersive technology.\n\nThese advancements will allow users and communities to engage in interactive, competitive, and creative experiences through lifelike avatars, captivating virtual worlds and contextual overlays that elevate the definition of reality. On the other hand, it will position Qualcomm as one of the best-positioned metaverse stocks in the chipmaking area.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The S&amp;P 500 Just Hit An All-Time High. Here's 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Still Looks Like a Bargain",
        "content": "Over the last year, a big contributor to the momentum in the market has been hype around artificial intelligence (AI). The overall bullish outlook on the technology seems to have carried over into 2024. This week, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high level of 4,868.55.\n\nSome of the biggest contributors to the market over the last 12 months are the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- a moniker used to describe the largest technology enterprises by market cap. As of the time of this article, five of the Magnificent Seven stocks boast market capitalizations of over $1 trillion -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. However, with a market cap of $980 billion, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) could very well be the next to join and firmly remain in the exclusive club.\n\nIn 2023, Meta stock returned 194% -- handily outperforming the broader markets. With such outsize returns and the overall market soaring to new highs, is it time to book some gains in Meta stock?\n\nA thorough analysis of the company's financial and operational picture may show that the stock trades for a bargain. Let's look at Meta and assess if now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.\n\nMeta's financial profile is rock-solid\n\nIn 2022, Meta made a big bet on virtual reality (VR) as it turned its focus to the metaverse. However, investors quickly soured on these new ambitions as the company's revenue decelerated and expenses rose. While the metaverse is still part of the company's long-term vision, Meta spent much of 2023 returning to its advertising roots and right-sizing its cost profile.\n\nThrough the first nine months of 2023, Meta's total revenue increased 12% year over year, while free cash flow grew by 140%. A return to advertising growth coupled with multiple rounds of layoffs helped Meta get back on track. As such, the company has been able to swiftly reinvest these excess profits back into the business. Image Source: Getty Images\n\nWhat growth drivers does the company have?\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Meta has a couple of interesting opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, the company already has a series of VR hardware devices through its Reality Labs business. Currently, Reality Labs only constitutes about 1% of Meta's total revenue. Moreover, hefty research and development (R&D) and marketing costs are taking a toll on this division, as it does not yet generate positive operating margins.\n\nNevertheless, one of the company's recent augmented reality (AR) developments could be a tangential growth driver for Meta's current VR headsets and the overall Reality Labs business. Meta's smart glasses are a unique new piece of hardware the company is testing. Although competitors like Alphabet have attempted to commercialize similar products in the past, I am bullish that Meta will be able to integrate smart glasses into its existing VR and AR infrastructure and bolster its Reality Labs operation.\n\nAnother catalyst Meta currently has is its generative AI model, Llama 2. Llama 2 already has many impressive partners, including cybersecurity firms such as Palo Alto Networks, workplace automation services including Atlassian, and cloud providers like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Each of these end markets is enormous and becoming increasingly reliant on AI applications. While it's still early days, Meta is quietly setting itself up to enjoy long-term secular tailwinds from key markets such as cloud computing, among others.\n\nMeta stock looks like a bargain\n\nAs of the time of this article, Meta stock is already up 8% this year. But even so, the company trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.9 -- nearly identical to that of the S&P 500. This could signal that investors do not expect Meta to outperform the broader markets. META Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nI see Meta as an undervalued growth stock whose ambitions in artificial intelligence are not fully understood. Meta stock looks historically cheap at a price-to-free cash flow of just 26.7. Moreover, given the toll Reality Labs currently takes on Meta's overall profitability, the company's total earnings could actually be even higher -- suggesting the stock could be even cheaper than it looks.\n\nAs concerns around the macroeconomy begin to improve, Meta looks well-positioned to benefit from the AI movement -- an industry that can fuel both the company's advertising and VR businesses. While it's already experienced a slight bump in the first few weeks of the year, now still looks like an incredible opportunity to scoop up shares in Meta given the stock's discount to historical valuations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "content": "According to the International Monetary Fund, we are on the brink of a technology revolution spearheaded by artificial intelligence. The technology will boost productivity, accelerate global growth and raise incomes globally. Multiple AI stocks will benefit from this transformation.\n\nToday, businesses are analyzing how they can leverage AI to improve productivity and how it affects the competitive landscape. Already, organizations are using AI in various use cases, such as application development, customer service, pharmaceutical discovery and creative design.\n\nHowever, to achieve the promise of AI, companies must make significant investments. That starts with the data and models they use. First, organizations are investing in systems to collect, store, manage and access massive data sets. Then, using the right models, they can derive patterns from their data to drive decision-making, customer service and innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAcross the artificial intelligence stack, several companies are meeting various needs. From chip companies producing chips for training large language models to companies developing large language models. These AI stocks are at the forefront of this race and will be winners in 2024.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the largest semiconductor foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the leading AI stocks. The company is seeing soaring demand as the scramble for AI chips for data centers and edge computing grows. Over the years, many integrated device manufacturers transitioned to fabless designers, cementing Taiwan Semiconductor’s importance in chip production.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has built an unassailable competitive advantage in its process technology. By investing heavily in research and development, it has maintained leadership in node advancement. As a result, it attracts and retains high-quality, fabless customers. For instance, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in mobile chips and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in graphic processing units.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, the company is producing leading-edge node chips for its AI customers. Competitors have had challenges producing these chips, enabling Taiwan Semi to dominate the market and charge higher prices. Already the firm is producing 3-nanometer chips for Nvidia, Apple and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as competitors struggle to catch up.\n\nOn January 19, the company released results and issued upbeat guidance. The company is benefitting from cloud service providers upgrading their data centers with chips supporting AI capabilities. Management was optimistic on high-performance computing demand related to AI, forecasting more than 20% revenue growth in 2024.\n\nWhile AI adoption has been mainly in the data center, it will become ubiquitous, supporting Taiwan Semi’s growth. Consumer devices such as smartphones and industrial equipment will need AI capabilities, ushering in the next growth cycle.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it is primarily a social media company, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a player in the AI for a while. Its increased efforts in the field came out of necessity after Apple’s IDFA changes curtailed user tracking. Faced with diminished advertising accuracy, Meta Platforms pivoted to AI.\n\nTwo years later, the company has become one of the top AI stocks. Notably, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has touted AI as “the foundation of our discovery engine and our ads business.” The company has amassed hundreds of top A.I. researchers and invested in significant computer power to power these systems. These efforts are paying off with impressive results.\n\nIn February 2023, it released LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) a foundational large language model. Meta’s aim was to advance AI research. Then, in July 2023 it released LLaMA 2 for research and commercial use. Impressively, the model outperforms other open-source language models in coding, reasoning, proficiency, and knowledge tests.\n\nMeta has adopted a unique approach, giving away its models for free. By open-sourcing its models, Meta hopes third-party developers will help improve the platform. Like Linux became the open-source operating system, Meta hopes Llama will become integral to building the next generation of AI applications.\n\nZuckerberg recently committed to developing artificial general intelligence. He pledged to spend heavily on compute infrastructure to support this effort. If Meta Platforms manages to standardize AI development through its open-source models, it will be a key player in the ecosystem. Considering Zuckerberg’s focus on winning in AI, it remains one of the top artificial intelligence stocks, and certainly one of the artificial intelligence stocks you should grab.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), has been derided for losing the AI war to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These assessments seem overly pessimistic. The company is an innovator and will prove the doubters wrong.\n\nThe search giant has made significant investments in artificial intelligence. The most significant one was the 2014 acquisition of DeepMind. Secondly, Google has been using artificial intelligence in search for a while, even before OpenAI launched ChatGPT.\n\nMoreover, it is introducing products that will integrate generative AI into search. Today, users can rely on Bard for chat-like responses. It is also testing Search Generative Experience and has expanded its features since its May 2023 launch.\n\nOne competitive advantage that positions Google to succeed is its high-quality training data. Today, Google has six products with over 2 billion users and 15 products, each with more than 500 million users. This data has been crucial in creating context-aware AI functions. For instance, features such as Smart Compose in Gmail have significantly improved the user experience.\n\nAlphabet’s leadership among artificial intelligence stocks extends beyond software to hardware, making it one of the best AI stocks. It developed a specialized chip, a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), specifically for AI applications. Its TPUs and open-source framework, Tensor, power services such as Gmail, Maps and YouTube.\n\nAs Google integrates AI into its products, it will see more growth. For example, serving context-rich ads into generative search results will improve ad conversion and monetization. In December 2023, Google released Gemini, its latest and most powerful LLM, proving Alphabet is still in the AI race. Don’t count out this technology giant yet; it has the resources to win!\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you were asked how many firms currently are valued at $1 trillion or more based on market cap, what would you guess? The answer might surprise you. It’s six. Of those six, one, Saudi Aramco, Is not readily accessible to American investors as it isn’t listed on commonly accessed exchanges.  Anyway, long story short, reaching a valuation of $1 trillion is an extraordinary feat. This has led us to this article on what brands could be the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nInvesting in such companies inherently makes sense. These companies are extraordinarily powerful and due to their extreme success are likely to continue to thrive. The three companies listed below could be the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is currently the 7th most valuable publicly traded stock overall. It boasts a market cap of $966 billion at the time of writing. Thus, Meta Platforms is very close to being considered one of those trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf and when Meta Platforms reaches $1 trillion it won’t be the first time it has achieved the feat. In late 2021 the company – then named Facebook – surpassed the mark. Shares are currently retesting those former highs in part due to positive remarks from Mizuho Securities. Analysts there recently increased their 12-month target price from $400 to $477.  If shares rise to that level, that would be almost exactly $100 above price levels when the shares first eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.\n\nArithmetically, that would suggest that Meta Platforms’ market capitalization would increase by more than 26% leading to a new evaluation above $1.2 trillion. It’s an entirely reasonable expectation given how strongly the company has rebounded in 2023 and into early 2024.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn reality, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is quite far from realistically reaching $1 trillion in valuation. However, AMD has made such significant strides over the last few years that it warrants discussion.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, AMD’s market cap is as high as it’s ever been, just above $260 billion. The company essentially has to quadruple in value to reach $1 trillion. Current projections suggest it could happen by the year 2031 based on share prices alone and the assumption that float does not increase.\n\nCertainly, other stocks much closer to $1 trillion in market cap at the moment are likely to cross that threshold first. However, I want to note just how rapidly AMD has grown over the last decade. In 2015 it was valued at less than $2 billion. The company has grown by a factor of 130 in less than a decade.\n\nToday, AMD is carving out a position as a legitimate challenger to Nvidia about artificial intelligence. The company will release its mi300 chips this year. Those chips are already seeing substantial demand from dominant firms that scoop up large volumes of chips for generative AI purposes.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a very interesting year for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)  and its stock. The company is known to be the largest foundry in the semiconductor industry. It is responsible for the technology behind the leading chips which it manufactures for the world’s best-known chip companies including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and more.\n\nTaiwan semiconductor manufacturing’s market cap has only eclipsed $700 billion once in its history. it is currently valued at less than $600 billion. However, the company’s recent bullish projections for 2024 chip production are a strong signal overall. The company expects the revenue growth to be above 20% this year.\n\nThat growth rate is roughly double that expected across the wider semiconductor sector overall. The bullish take here is that 2024 is shaping up to be a period of continued growth overall. Additionally, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Rafael Bostic Stated that he expects rate cuts to be implemented earlier than he had previously anticipated. Should that occur, it’s reasonable to believe that the tech sector will receive a boost which could drive Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing even higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The run-up in valuation for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) last year meant artificial intelligence (AI) was just about the only thing anyone was discussing. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 set the world on fire with its potential applications in business and everyday use. Demand for AI tools took off.\n\nThat’s continuing into 2024, and with good reason. We’ve only just started scratching the surface of the opportunities AI unlocks. There is a long runway to go. Of course, there is a dark side to AI and headwinds too. But money is still pouring into the market, and the following three companies are among the best AI stocks to buy.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia sucked most of the oxygen out of the room when it came to AI chips. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), however, is making a name for itself too. The chipmaker recently unveiled its MI300X AI chip, which offers better performance than Nvidia’s popular H100 chip. It’s already lining up a stellar clientele list. Both Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft announced they would buy AMD’s chip. The latter will use it in its Azure cloud services business.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough the chipmaker didn’t announce a price, it’s expected to be cheaper than the $40,000 Nvidia reportedly charges for its H100. CEO Lisa Su said it would have to cost less and work better if AMD wanted to lure customers to its chips. AMD also beefed up its software platform and application interface ROCm to provide a better user experience when using the AI chips.\n\nMario Gabelli of GAMCO Investors (OTCMKTS:GAMI) boosted his holdings of AMD stock by 42% in the third quarter. He paid an average of around $108 a share for the stock, giving him a 55% gain already. He stands to reap even greater gains because of the exponential growth expected to come from AI.\n\nWall Street forecasts Advanced Micro Devices will grow earnings at 13% a year for the next five years. AMD has a 47x forward price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nSemiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) just reported robust earnings for the fourth quarter. Driven by demand for the specialized equipment needed to make AI chips, orders more than tripled from the year-ago figure to a record 9 billion euros. Sales soared to 7.2 billion euros and generated 2 billion euros in profits, up 9% year-over-year (YoY).\n\nASML is the world’s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. These are critical tools required by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung to produce the advanced AI chips customers or themselves need. TSM is the biggest foundry and is where Nvidia gets its chips from.\n\nGabelli was a buyer here again. He increased his holdings by about 10% and paid around $664 per share. That’s a 26% gain after the recent earnings run-up. Yet, Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management was also adding to his position bringing his total shares to almost 4.9 million.\n\nHowever, ASML surprised analysts by keeping its sales guidance flat for the period. New trade restrictions on China have clouded just how much business the equipment maker can do. A lot of sales were pulled forward into the quarter, but the upward momentum suggests it will keep moving higher.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SOUN stock: SoundHound's Headquarters exterior featuring a sign with the company's logo in the foreground and a parking lot and building in the background.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nYou might know SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) as the music identification app to help you remember a song’s title and artist when you hear it playing. Yet that’s a commoditized business, and SoundHound was already fully embracing AI before going public in 2021.\n\nSix years earlier, it introduced Houndify to the world, the company’s “voice-enabled conversational interface.” You can tell AI wasn’t a thing then, as it was not identified as a key technology, though that was still at the heart of it. The voice AI platform could allow devices to hold conversations with users and answer complex questions. Today, Houndify is behind Honda’s (NYSE:HMC) in-car assistant in Japan and Europe. It is also used in a host of other industries, including telecom, hospitality, restaurants, financial services and voice-enabled mobile apps.\n\nSoundHound is reaping the benefits. Revenue is up 33% in 2023 to $28.7 million with gross margins hitting 73%. Adjusted EBITDA improved 57% from last year, as losses narrowed to $7.3 million. Profitability is just over the horizon. That may be why hedge fund operator Mark Diker of Diker Management increased his position by 150%. He now owns over 502,000 shares.\n\nWhile SOUN stock is up 37% in the last 12 months, it’s down sharply from its highs. Trading below $2 a share indicates the market might want to first see profits from a supposed AI growth stock. Soundhound is certainly a riskier stock than ASML or AMD, and it’s an oblique play on AI. Yet this could be a diamond in the rough for investors willing to let this company develop its own voice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought This Week",
        "content": "There never seems to be a bad time for Cathie Wood to reshape her portfolios. The founder, CEO, and main stock-picker for the Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds has been busy adding to some of her positions this week. She has also been pruning some of her holdings, but let's talk about the buys.\n\nWood added to existing positions in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Recursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX), and Ginkgo Bioworks(NYSE: DNA) this week. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nOne of last year's biggest winners was Facebook parent Meta Platforms. The stock nearly tripled last year, up 194%. I know I wasn't the only investor who shook my head when Facebook changed its corporate moniker to Meta in the fall of 2021. I guess CEO Mark Zuckerberg is getting the last laugh now.\n\nThe social media giant's dream of embracing the virtual realm of the metaverse hasn't exactly been fulfilled. The Meta Quest virtual reality headset remains a niche product. However, its family of apps that includes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp remains ridiculously magnetic, attracting 3.96 million monthly active users. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRevenue rose 21% to a whopping $34.2 billion in constant currency in its latest quarter. A 31% jump in ad impressions across its offerings was the biggest driver, even if the average revenue per ad took a 6% dip.\n\nDespite the stock's surge since bottoming out in late 2022, Wood believes that it can keep going higher. Why else would she have bought more shares of Meta on Monday? She wasn't the only one feeling more bullish about Meta. Citi raised its price target on the shares a day later.\n\nCiti analyst Ronald Josey is bumping the stock's price target from $425 to $440, naturally sticking to a bullish buy rating. Josey's read is that the online advertising market got stronger in the fourth quarter, and that bodes well heading into Meta's financial update next week. The successful monetization of Facebook's Reels, promising new ad products, and its overall sticky engagement make the stock Citi's top internet stock for 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Recursion Pharmaceuticals\n\nIf you follow Wood's daily market transactions it's obvious that she's warming to Recursion Pharmaceuticals in a major way. She has added to her position for 12 consecutive trading days through Wednesday of this week. Unlike Meta -- a household name and one of just six stocks with market caps north of $1 trillion -- Recursion is a small stock with a $2.2 billion market cap.\n\nRecursion is a clinical stage techbio company. It offers an operating system that leverages machine learning algorithms and searchable biology and chemistry relationships to help speed up the development of potential treatments. It has just $47 million in trailing revenue, and it's understandably years away from profitability. However, it's been striking deals to expand the reach of its Recursion OS platform and beef up its artificial intelligence goals. Wood's fresh purchases now find her owning more than 10% of Recursion's outstanding shares.\n\n3. Ginkgo Bioworks\n\nMany of Wood's stock purchases have been in the biotech space. She has now added to her Ginkgo Bioworks stake for six straight trading days. The biosecurity and biofoundry specialist posted mixed financial results in its latest quarter, but it comforted investors earlier this month by announcing preliminary financial results for fiscal 2023.\n\nIt continues to expect to report between $250 million and $260 million in revenue for all of last year, based on preliminary unaudited estimates. Ginkgo Bioworks is encouraged by its strong performance in cell engineering revenue and cash-rich balance sheet. Wood is a believer. She now owns nearly 11% of the stock's total shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 22, 2024\n\nCitigroup is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

        "title": "10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years.\n\nDespite the massive bull run of 2023 and eye-popping gains of tech stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) fueled by the AI boom, many analysts believe tech companies are just getting started with AI innovation and the new era of gains that started after the launch of ChatGPT and generative AI in late 2022 has no end in sight. Short Hills' Steve Weiss recently said in a program on CNBC that despite all the hullaballoo around AI, the AI products offered by companies like Microsoft are not \"prime-day ready\" as they still need a lot of refinements and tweaks along with innovation before they could be relied upon. Weiss, who is highly bullish on Alphabet, said that it's not easy to break habits of users and concerns related to AI affecting Alphabet's search business are overdone. But what does that mean for the broader AI industry? That companies are still playing around and testing the waters with their initial AI product announcements shows that in the next five to ten years we will see a lot of AI-related innovation that could further push the stock prices of mega-cap tech stocks higher.\n\nThe long rally of 2023 and a rebound in tech stocks in 2024 after a brief decline has also showed that the AI-led rally in tech stocks could not be labeled as a bubble. A Wall Street Journal report last year quoted Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, who said that the rise of AI gave a boost to the stock prices of established, blue-chip companies which are backed by strong fundamentals.\n\n“What you’re getting with these stocks is pristine balance sheets, stable earnings growth, mostly reasonable valuations, and you have that AI kicker,” Harvey reportedly said.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnabling Tech Sector: Picks and Shovels for AI Technologies\n\nEarlier this month, UBS said in a report that the demand for cybersecurity and AI is expected to skyrocket in the future, which could boost the enabling tech subsector. Enabling technologies enable the development, production and deployment of technologies like AI. Many call tech enabling companies \"pick and shovel\" companies that power the IT infrastructure. According to UBS estimates, the enabling tech subsector is projected to grow to $1.2 trillion by 2025.\n\nUBS in its report listed nine tech enabling stocks that it believes can continue to grow through 2030. Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years\n\nPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Methodology\n\nFor this article we picked the nine stocks UBS recommended for the next few years through 2030 in its Global Equity Focus report mentioned above while the 10th stock in our list is backed by another expert recommendation by an analyst and a hedge fund manager. We ranked our list based on the number of hedge fund investors in these companies. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nChinese internet giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) ranks 10th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy for the next five years. UBS said in its report highlighting top tech enablement stocks that a recovery in the ads market would bode well for Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). UBS also said Baidu Inc's (NASDAQ:BIDU) PE valuation is \"undemanding\" and its non-ads business is among the growth drivers for the stock.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 44 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). The most notable stakeholder of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) during this period was Panayotis Takis Sparaggis's Alkeon Capital Management which owns a $332 million stake in Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).\n\nAriel Global Fund made the following comment about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“By comparison, after a strong run last quarter, China’s internet search and online community leader, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) declined alongside a correction in Chinese stocks attributed to weak gross domestic product. We believe this price action runs counter to the company’s solid business fundamentals. Baidu delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat in the period, driven by a recovery in ad and cloud revenues. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is launching a generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI’s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China’s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu’s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.”\n\n9. ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nUBS is bullish on ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML), the Netherlands-based company that makes machines used in the development of semiconductors. UBS likes the stock due to the company's pricing power and high industry barriers. ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) recently posted fourth quarter results. Net profit in the quarter came in at 2.05 billion euros versus 1.86 billion euros expected. Net sales in the period jumped 12.5% year over year.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nLike ASML, analysts are also bullish on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM).\n\nClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture, which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term. On an individual stock basis, the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included ASML and Tokyo Electron in the IT sector.”\n\n8. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nDespite cracks appearing in the EV industry amid regulation, costs and a declining interest from users, many analysts believe the future of the auto industry belongs to EVs. Cathie Wood, who has a five-year investment time horizon for her stock picks, continues to believe Tesla will soar in the next few years. In a latest program on CNBC, Wood said most car sales in the next five years would be electric. Cathie Wood believe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock would reach $2000 by 2027. Famous investor Ron Baron, who founded Baron Capital, also believes Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock could hit $1,500 by 2030.\n\nTsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”\n\n7. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 87\n\nAnother semiconductor name in the list of the best stocks to buy for the next five years, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares have gained about 109% over the past one year. UBS is bullish on Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) due to 5G-related growth catalysts.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 87 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) was Fisher Asset Management which had a $1.7 billion stake in Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”\n\n6. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 99\n\nUBS believes ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) will benefit from a growing demand of digital products as well as the AI automation trend. Earlier this month Goldman Sachs published a list of stocks it thinks are the best to hedge the tech drawdown risk. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) made it to the list. Here is what Goldman Sachs said about this hedging strategy:\n\n“For hedging the tech drawdown risk, we rank US listed hedging alternatives to XLK based on their sensitivity to the factor and current cost in the options market to identify optimal hedges below,” Goldman analysts wrote.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow is one of the top stocks in the tech enabling sector according to UBS.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) continues to grow revenue and earnings at above a 20% rate, as they have for many years. The company has a software automation platform that efficiently builds applications on top of and across many enterprise functions. The NOW platform can automate almost any workflow previously done through email, spreadsheets, or some other less-than-efficient method. Its addressable market is very large because of the sheer breadth and depth of the tasks that can be automated by using its software. ServiceNow’s offerings tend to save customers money and make their workflows less prone to error. The company’s growth has been among the most consistent in our Portfolio prior to, during, and after the pandemic.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Hedge Funds 10 AI Stocks Billionaires Are Crazy About Jim Cramer’s 10 Best AI Stocks\n\nDisclosure.None. 10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Yearswas initially published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks That Could Help Make You Rich by Retirement",
        "content": "Technology powers the world and makes our lives easier. But did you know that investing in technology can help drive your portfolio's value higher over time to better prepare you for retirement?\n\nTech stocks range widely, covering every aspect of the tech cycle, from the manufacture of semiconductors and graphics processing units (GPUs) to the creation of the metaverse and exploration of artificial intelligence (AI). These growth stocks are riding on the tailwind of digitalization amid a technology revolution that will enable them to post steady growth over many years.\n\nInvestors should focus on businesses that are leaders in their respective fields and enjoy long-term catalysts that allow them to grow their businesses. Here are three to consider now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nSocial media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Facebook, picture-sharing app Instagram, and chat program WhatsApp. The company has bounced back spectacularly after posting a downbeat set of earnings for 2022 as CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 to be a \"year of efficiency.\"\n\nFor the first nine months of 2023, Meta saw revenue rise 12.3% year over year to $94.8 billion. Operating income jumped nearly 35% to $30.4 billion, while net income shot up 35.2% to $25.1 billion. Free cash flow more than doubled to $32.1 billion.\n\nMeta's daily and monthly active users continue to climb, assuring the company can still grow. Daily active users for the third quarter of 2023 rose 5.1% year over year to 2.1 billion, while monthly active users inched up 3.1% year over year to three billion.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta appears to have streamlined its operations by eliminating thousands of jobs and bringing its personnel numbers down to mid-2021 levels. The company is also spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's computer chips to power research on AI projects.\n\nMeta is investing in these GPUs as it pursues its new goal of developing artificial general intelligence, all while still spending significant sums building up its vision of the metaverse, a virtual world where people can interact with one another through digital avatars.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is still early days in the quest for AI dominance, but Meta is committing its resources to build up this nascent industry where there is a long growth runway for the company to continue shining. The metaverse also represents the future of how people will interact digitally and presents compelling opportunities for the company to monetize over time.\n\nExciting days are ahead for investors as Meta's share price hits a new record high, signaling investor optimism over the company's prospects.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a GPU designer and manufacturer pioneering the accelerated computing era. The company's platform powers nearly three-quarters of the world's supercomputers and boasts 4.5 million developers. The company is riding on the generative AI wave that is seeing orders surge to new records.\n\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Nvidia saw revenue surge 85% year over year to $38.8 billion. Its operating income catapulted more than sixfold to $19.4 billion, while net income leaped fivefold to $17.5 billion. Unsurprisingly, free cash flow also exploded, going from $2.1 billion to $15.8 billion.\n\nNvidia has provided an upbeat outlook for its fourth quarter, with revenue expected to come in around $20 billion. If it achieves this forecast, it would represent a more than tripling of its fourth quarter 2023 sales of $6.1 billion.\n\nThere could be much more to come for the GPU producer. Nvidia is working with Foxconn to develop AI factories, a new category of data centers. These can power an increasing number of applications, such as AI-powered robotics platforms and language-based generative AI services.\n\nNvidia also partnered with Indian technology giants Infosys, Reliance Industries, and Tata to build India's foundation large language model (LLM) and provide infrastructure-as-a-service for AI services within the country. The GPU specialist is working with Microsoft to run custom generative AI enterprise applications on the latter's Microsoft Azure platform to allow intelligent search, summarization, and content generation.\n\nThese are just some of the collaborations Nvidia inked recently, but there is much more potential for the company to work with other players to build LLMs and spur the further evolution of generative AI. Nvidia is even working in medicine, collaborating with Genentech to develop new therapeutics by harnessing the power of generative AI.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless and should translate to many more opportunities for Nvidia to scale its business and capture more top- and bottom-line growth.\n\nPalantir\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is a software company that harnesses the power of AI to create platforms for clients to perform data analyses. Its software is used by a wide range of clients, including government agencies, manufacturing companies, financial firms, and healthcare institutions.\n\nPalantir reported a strong set of earnings for the first nine months of 2023 as revenue increased by 15.7% year over year to $1.6 billion. The business also churned out operating income and net income of $54.2 million and $120.5 million, respectively, reversing the operating and net losses in the prior year.\n\nThe current quarter also represents the software company's fourth consecutive quarter of profitability. Free cash flow for the first nine month more than tripled year over year to $400.8 million, a strong sign that shows the business can be both profitable and free-cash-flow generative.\n\nPalantir also chalked up a higher customer count, with the total jumping 34% year over year to 453. Of this group, 330 were commercial customers, representing a 45% climb. In a sign that its top 20 customers are spending more, the average trailing-12-month revenue for this group rose 13% year over year to $54 million. Billings increased by 8% to $550 million, and Palantir secured 80 deals of at least $1 million during the quarter, of which 12 were at least $10 million in value.\n\nIn January, the company signed a multi-year commercial partnership with Option Care Health for its software to be used to improve both patient outcomes and efficiency. The company's momentum in securing new business and its turnaround to profitability point to better days ahead as investors better appreciate its business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
        "content": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow Much Debt Does Meta Platforms Carry?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2023 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.92b, over one year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$61.1b in cash, so it actually has US$42.7b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Strong Is Meta Platforms' Balance Sheet?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$30.5b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$42.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$61.1b in cash and US$12.9b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its total liabilities are just about perfectly matched by its shorter-term, liquid assets.\n\nHaving regard to Meta Platforms' size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$989.9b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that Meta Platforms has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso positive, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 24% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Meta Platforms's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Meta Platforms has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the most recent three years, Meta Platforms recorded free cash flow worth 79% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Meta Platforms has US$42.7b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$38b, being 79% of its EBIT. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.  We've identified 1 warning sign  with Meta Platforms , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "content": "By many metrics, we’re already in a bull market. Stocks have reached new all-time highs in most indices, with investors focused on S&P 500 returns cheering a return to new highs. In this period called the “Usain Bolt” era, stocks return to posting new records on a seemingly daily basis.\n\nThat’s great for investors, as a bull market signifies rising prices in financial markets. Various stocks and traded assets are seeing their valuations balloon. Investors feel wealthy and potentially stimulate more economic activity.

        "content": "Entering a bull market wasn’t a linear journey. With the market shift from a 2022 bear market, where safer stocks gained favor, to 2023’s confidence, it prompted a return to growth stocks.\n\nDespite the S&P 500‘s 23% surge, some 2022 gainers declined in 2023. S&P 500 Pure Value rose 5%, while Nasdaq-100 tech jumped 52%. Amid the five-year market volatility and 2022’s macroeconomic challenges causing sell-offs, many prominent tech stock shares remain resilient and appealing for long-term investments.\n\nLet’s examine three stocks that investors should buy and hold for the next five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the last two decades, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) evolved from a small online bookstore to dominate e-commerce, expanding its product range through Amazon Marketplace. Introducing services like Amazon Prime, it then ventured into cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It sustained impressive growth and became a preferred provider in the commercial sector.\n\nDespite Amazon’s massive size limiting historical growth rates, it holds strong growth potential. In e-commerce, with a 38% U.S. market share and low overall retail share, expansion abounds, especially in India’s emerging market. The cloud computing industry benefits from ongoing cloud migration and AI advancements.\n\nAmazon experienced double-digit sales growth, recording impressive 13% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q3 2023. Profits surged, with operating income quadrupling and net income tripling to $9.9 billion. The company’s commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction fosters a culture of experimentation. Additionally, it positions it well for sustained growth and adaptation to future trends.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2023, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) prioritized efficiency. Accordingly, 2024 presents opportunities for remarkable growth. Despite the stock’s surge, positive catalysts suggest further improvement and strong sales growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta faces a major risk in 2024 – the prospect of a U.S. recession, albeit mild. Various metrics signal challenges for the company, given its reliance on advertising revenue. Recessions, typically short-lived, do pose threats. However, Meta’s dominant social media presence remains a strength, as the company attracts more users and enhances its advertising pricing power.\n\nMeta Platforms is nearing the $1 trillion market capitalization level, surging 200% in 2023. The company’s current market cap of more than $980 billion could easily reach this threshold in short order. If Meta rejoins the trillion-dollar club, and the stock trends toward new all-time highs, investors will be increasingly focused on forward-looking growth projections. At least for now, I expect projections to increase, due to the strong fundamentals of this company’s core business.\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.\n\nSource: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanadian-based fast food giant Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), with brands like Burger King and Tim Hortons, reported robust Q2 FY2023 results.\n\nThe company yields 9.6% growth in comparable sales and increased EBITDA surged from $618 million in 2022 to $665 million in 2023. Importantly, QSR stock offers a 2.9% forward dividend yield, providing steady income via consistent dividend payments over the last five years.\n\nIn recent news, Restaurant Brands and Carrols Restaurant Group announced a deal. RBI will acquire all outstanding Carrols shares for $9.55 each in an all-cash transaction, valuing Carrols at approximately $1 billion. This represents a 23.1% premium to Carrols’ 30-day average price.\n\nTom Curtis, President of Burger King U.S. and Canada, expressed enthusiasm about acquiring Carrols. He aims to enhance guest experiences through rapid restaurant remodeling. Deborah Derby, Carrols’ President and CEO, highlighted the transaction’s immediate value for shareholders and growth opportunities for team members within Restaurant Brands.\n\nFor long-term investors betting on continued innovation and growth with this company, Restaurant Brands is positioned well for the next five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Nvidia Dominates the AI Market, but Don't Ignore These 3 Challengers",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 1,420% over the past five years. Its growth was largely driven by the expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which prompted more companies to install its high-end GPUs in their data centers.\n\nNvidia generated 80% of its revenue from its data center chips in its latest quarter, while its gaming business -- its original growth engine prior to the AI boom -- only brought in 16% of its revenue. The bulls believe Nvidia's data center business will continue growing as companies develop more advanced generative AI platforms and large language models, and that its GPUs will remain the industry standard for processing those complicated tasks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's current list of customers supports that bullish view. ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Amazon, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and other tech giants all use its chips to power their AI services. But over the long term, other chipmakers could loosen Nvidia's iron grip on the AI market. Let's take a closer look at the three most likely challengers.\n\n1. Intel\n\nNvidia's GPUs usually work alongside Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) high-end Xeon CPUs in data centers to accelerate machine learning and AI tasks. For Intel, which still controls about 94% of the server CPU market, Nvidia's expansion into the data center market is an unwelcome intrusion which implies its CPUs can't efficiently handle AI tasks on their own.\n\nCPUs still process one piece of data at a time, while GPUs process a large array of integers and floating point numbers simultaneously -- which makes them better suited for graphics and AI applications. To close that gap, Intel launched its own line of Xe GPUs in September 2020, and its Xe-HP (High Performance) and Xe-HPC (High Performance Compute) directly target Nvidia's data center GPUs. It followed that up with the rollout of its new \"Max\" data center GPUs last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an unusual departure from its first-party foundry model, Intel outsources the production of its GPUs to its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- which also manufactures Nvidia's high-end GPUs. Those chips haven't gained much momentum yet, but Intel's ongoing expansion of that business -- and its ability to bundle its GPUs with its Xeon CPUs -- might eventually hurt Nvidia.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nNvidia's expansion into the data center market gave it an edge against Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which controls a much smaller slice of the discrete GPU market. However, AMD has been fighting back with its new Instinct data center chips for AI tasks.\n\nIt launched its first three Instinct GPUs (the MI6, MI8, and MI25) in 2017, which were followed by additional 7-nanometer and 6nm MI chips over the following four years. It launched its latest MI300 Instinct chips, which were built on TSMC's 5nm and 6nm nodes, last December. In the latest benchmarks, AMD's top-tier MI300X beats Nvidia's H100 in terms of processing power and memory bandwidth, but Nvidia claims the H100 still outperforms the MI300X when it's running on optimized software.\n\nAMD's AI ambitions could cause problems for Nvidia, especially if it continues its tradition of selling its chips at lower prices. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are already testing or running Instinct GPUs -- and that customer list could grow longer as cost-conscious data center operators shop around for the best deals.\n\n3. Internally developed chips\n\nLast but not least, Nvidia's dominance of the data center GPU market is driving many of its top customers -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta -- to develop their own AI accelerator chips. It could take years for those projects to bear fruit, but the development of those chips raises red flags for Nvidia's long-term growth.\n\nLast year, Google published a research paper that suggested its own fourth-generation TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) were faster and more efficient than Nvidia's A100 chips. Meta also recently poached an entire research team from Graphcore, the AI start-up that claims its \"graph processing\" method can process AI tasks more efficiently than Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThese tech giants are still buying a lot of Nvidia's A100 GPUs to process their AI tasks, but they could gradually replace those chips with their first-party silicon to cut costs. If that happens, Nvidia's biggest growth engine could sputter out.\n\nInvestors shouldn't assume Nvidia is invincible\n\nNvidia's future looks bright, but investors should expect it to face some unpredictable challenges over the next few years. Intel, AMD, and first-party chips won't throttle its growth anytime soon, but they could eventually evolve into major threats. Simply put, investors shouldn't assume Nvidia is an invincible leader of the AI market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The stock market is off to a solid start of 2024. All the major indices are at or near all-time highs, thanks in large part to bullish sentiment for tech. Artificial intelligence is going to change the world (according to Wall Street and Silicon Valley at least) and that’s led companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to all hit new all-time highs in the process.\n\nBut tech stocks aren’t the only companies marching to new records. Several consumer stocks are also setting fresh milestones this year, powered by bullish consumer sentiment, strong retail sales, diminishing inflation pressures and a still-healthy job market. Adding to the mix? Investors are convinced that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates as soon as March and most certainly by May, a move that could fuel spending even further.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s a look at a dozen consumer stocks trading at or near their all-time peaks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) and Mastercard (MA)\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA): The credit card and debit card giants are benefiting from the American consumer’s continued willingness to shop until they drop. Both stocks have gained about 20% in the past 12 months and have outperformed the broader market over the past five years, with Visa nearly doubling and Mastercard soaring more than 115%. Visa and Mastercard each have a consistent track record of reporting earnings that have topped Wall Street estimates, and both companies are expected to report double-digit annual profit gains for the foreseeable future.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD), Chipotle (CMG), and Wingstop (WING)\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING): Busy consumers are more than happy to order fast food. And that’s great news for these three popular restaurant chains. The December retail sales report showed that sales at food and drinking spots were up more than 11% from a year ago. Mickey D’s, Chipotle and Wingstop have also boosted their mobile ordering capabilities in the past few years, leading to surging demand from people looking to make the fast-food experience even more convenient.\n\nStory continues\n\nUber (UBER)\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER): The ride-hailing giant is also increasingly dominating the food delivery business thanks to its Uber Eats subsidiary and acquisition of Postmates in 2020. Its Uber Eats delivers from many top restaurant chains. Profits for the delivery business grew more rapidly than the mobility (ride-hailing) business for Uber in the third quarter. And Uber’s diverse business model seems to be giving it a big leg up on top competitors; Uber’s stock has surged nearly 80% in the past two years while DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) have both fallen.\n\nCostco (COST), Abercrombie (ANF), and Dick’s Sporting (DKS)\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST), Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS): People love to shop for gigantic vats of ketchup and other super-sized items at wholesale retail giant Costco. The company  remains one of America’s top retailers, with analysts predicting more than $250 billion in sales this year. And who says that the shopping mall is dead? Trendy clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, which also owns the Hollister and Gilly Hicks chains, is thriving. Sales are expected to rise nearly 15% in 2024. Finally, Dick’s Sporting Goods continues to dominate the market for team apparel and sports equipment. Sales are steadily growing, and analysts have consistently boosted their earnings estimates for this year and 2025.\n\nMarriott (MAR), Hilton (HLT), and IHG (IHG)\n\nMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), Hilton Worldwide (NYSE:HLT) and InterContinental Hotels Group (NYSE:IHG): The Covid-19-induced slowdown in travel seems like ancient history now. People are taking vacations again and going on business trips. That’s great news for the traditional hotel chains. Marriott, Hilton, and Holiday Inn owner IHG are all near record highs despite competition from home sharing giant Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). This trio of lodging stocks are all expected to post average annual earnings increases north of 15% over the next few years. Looks like many consumers still enjoy having room service and getting their beds made.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

        "content": "When analysts write about the metaverse, it’s not uncommon for it to be in a derisive tone. The fact that we’re not all strapped into virtual reality (VR) headsets with our families at home indicates its failure. The truth is the metaverse is already here.\n\nJust like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) isn’t considered a failure due to the continued existence of central banks, taking the metaverse to the extreme is not the only measure of its success. The metaverse encompasses many technologies and user experiences, so its evolution doesn’t necessarily hinge on everyone adopting virtual reality headsets overnight.\n\nThe metaverse should be understood as an emergent concept, not a normative destination that determines its success or failure. It’s also perhaps inevitable that we are heading towards a future where virtual experiences and real life will continue to be closely intertwined, thus making the metaverse more evident for all.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, for those bullish on the metaverse’s continued rise, read on. Here are the best metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is likely the first company that investors think of when the idea of the metaverse comes to mind. Recently, the company has recovered from its post-pandemic losses, with its stock price surging 174.09% over the past year.\n\nMuch of this recovery was due to the bullishness of the market’s reaction to META’s AI investments and not solely due to its metaverse investments. Namely, CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” for AI products and the company’s record-high revenues in the previous year’s third quarter gave some buoyancy to its stock price.\n\nYet, META is still firmly committed to growing its metaverse products, too. Its initiatives include developing the Quest headset and Ray-Ban smart sunglasses and creating a virtual 3D interactive space called Horizon Worlds.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts predict that META’s EPS will grow 21.19% in FY2024 and 21.19% growth for its top line. That, then, makes it one of those metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is a lesser-known metaverse stock compared to META, but it still ticks all the boxes, which could make it an industry leader in the not-too-distant future. For one, Roblox is an immensely popular game amongst children and teenagers, with its own virtual worlds, economy and culture centered around Robux.\n\nIn recent times, RBLX pivoted its ecosystem from just being seen as a game for kids to include older users and adults, too.\n\nThe pivot may have worked in the company’s favor, as its revenues increased 37.77% last quarter, and free cash flow stood at $59.51 million, up from an $82.53 million loss in the prior quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street is bullish on the platform’s prospects. The company is rated a Buy, and analysts predict a potential 35.9% upside on the high end.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) is another metaverse stock that investors have been too quick to give up on in the past and were duly proven wrong. The company’s share is up 66.77% over the past year.\n\nAs reported by Forbes, Snap reported a 12% year-over-year increase in average daily active users. That brought its total to 406 million in the third quarter of 2023. The bigger picture, though, is that in the same quarter, Snap surpassed street estimates with total revenues of $1.19 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Its net income losses also tightened to $1.07 billion.\n\nSNAP is predicted to have a huge year for FY2024 and beyond. Analysts predict its EPS will surge by an incredible 135% and then surge again in FY2025 by 121.8%. That would bring its EPS to 33 cents, a massive increase from its 6 cents per share at the time of writing.\n\nThe EPS increase will likely lead to a further upside in its share price. Incredibly, 47 analysts rated SNAP, and the average price target is $288.82. For some context, the company’s share trades at just $16.61 at the time of writing. That’s a 1,638.83% implied upside.\n\nWith forecasts like these, SNAP is surely one of those metaverse stocks investors should consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Surging Growth Stocks to Buy for 2024",
        "content": "Last week, I wrote how 2024 would be all about earnings. Corporate fortunes are diverging, interest rates are stabilizing, and 2024 is shaping up to be a year when company performance matters more than big-picture macroeconomic stories.\n\nWe’re already seeing these effects. Last Wednesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) announced that its December revenues had handily beat expectations. The news would send Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) up 2% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) down 2%. It turns out AI chips are booming, but consumer electronics are not.\n\nSimilar trends are emerging in everything from streaming services to uranium miners. We’re no longer in a “rising tide” environment where every company moves in the same direction. And that means investors need to keep a close eye on corporate performance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo separate these winning firms from the laggards, InvestorPlace analyst Louis Navellier has long used earnings revisions as a key metric. Companies with rising Wall Street forecasts tend to perform better even after the forecasts have been publicly announced, while those with declining revisions tend to underperform long after the news. These insights have long been incorporated in his proven Portfolio Grader system and have helped Louis uncover the top-performing stock on the S&P 500 every year for 12 years running.\n\nIn 2023, we saw this effect play out in black and white (or red and green). An investor who bought the 10 companies with the highest upward revisions in the S&P 500 would have walked away with a 25.5% gain. That included companies like chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and cruise liner Carnival (NYSE:CCL). The former saw its 2023 earnings growth revised from 3.3% to 19.6% in Q4 2022… and subsequently saw shares rise 35% over the following 12 months. The latter would jump 130% over the same period!\n\nMeanwhile, those buying the bottom-10 companies would have fared far worse. Among these firms were Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), which essentially ended the year flat. Those buying the bottom-30 firms by earnings revisions would have also landed companies like Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY) and First Republic Bank (OTCMKTS:FRCB), two now-bankrupt firms.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow to Invest for 2024\n\nWe’ll see even more of these divergences this year. As I wrote here last week, investors are running out of patience with startups like QuantumScape (NYSE:QS). Competitors like BYD (NYSE:BYDDY) are racing ahead, and startups are finding it harder than before to raise cheap capital.\n\nThat means investors will need to keep a close eye on earnings revisions in 2024. To get you started, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com, our free news site, write this week on five companies that look set to succeed in the coming year.\n\n5 Surging Growth Stocks to Buy: Duolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nA-rated language-learning app Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) has one of the highest upward earnings revisions in the Russell 3000 index. Over the last quarter, the Pittsburgh-based tech firm has seen its 2024 earnings estimates rise from 15 cents to 82 cents, a fivefold increase.\n\nAs Marc Guberti notes in a recent update for InvestorPlace.com, much of this has to do with Duolingo’s expansion into new services, which is keeping user growth high. He notes how the app grew daily active users by 63% last quarter and has raised its full-year guidance as a result.\n\nJosh Enomoto also notes how Duolingo has been aggressively using AI to reduce workforce expenses and create new content. The company is now using artificial intelligence to help create work “dramatically faster” than before.\n\nOf course, Duolingo isn’t for everyone. As Guberti warns, the company’s high growth means shares trade at a significant premium at 119 times forward earnings. But the numbers are clear: Duolingo remains a high-growth company that’s transitioning itself from negative to positive earnings. If it continues to maintain such growth, history tells us that Duolingo has plenty of upside ahead.\n\n2. Spotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nA-rated Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) gets a special mention in Louis Navellier’s Market360 this week. The online streaming service has been accumulating new subscribers at an astonishing rate, and earnings have been revised up as a result. During the fourth quarter, Wall Street analysts moved their fiscal year 2024 earnings estimates from 37 cents per share to $2.10 – one of the highest revisions on the market.\n\nHere’s more from Louis and his team:\n\nSpotify currently has 574 million monthly average users – up 26% from a year ago. Of those, 226 million are premium users, providing Spotify with most of its revenue. In the third quarter, Spotify generated $2.91 billion from its premium members, and only $447 million through advertising directed at its free users.\n\nThe trick will be for Spotify to continue to convert free users to premium members. As it does that, the profits will continue to rise.\n\nAt InvestorPlace.com, Muslim Farooque agrees. He picks Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Spotify as his top 3 Stocks to Play the Rise of the Subscription Economy.\n\nStreaming services can only succeed if they have a critical mass of content. And as the leading firm in music and podcast streaming, Spotify likely will have the easiest time expanding its user base while monetizing existing customers.\n\n3. GitLab (GTLB) In this photo illustration the GitLab (GTLB) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn December, at InvestorPlace.com, Yiannis Zourmpanos noted how software development and IT operations (DevOps) platform company GitLab (NASDAQ:GTLB) was expanding its business with high-value customers. He believes this disruptive tech stock is set to soar by 2025:\n\nA substantial 37% year-over-year growth, from 638 customers to 874, suggests GitLab’s lead in attracting and retaining larger enterprises… GitLab’s consistently high dollar-based net retention rate was 128% in Q3. This reflects the company’s success in expanding revenue within its existing customer base.\n\nThe numbers suggest the same outcome. Over the past three months, analysts have revised their forward earnings estimates from 16 cents to 35 cents, more than doubling initial forecasts. In short, GitLab is bringing AI to software development and deployment, and renewed focus on AI-enhanced productivity tools has put the San Francisco-based firm’s growth into high gear.\n\nAnalyst Luke Lango rightly agrees. In a special report for Early Stage Investor (subscription required) he calls GitLab one of the Top 5 “highest-quality AI software applications” to buy for 2024, and says that shares have “likely upside into and beyond 2025.” Though few outside the industry have ever heard of GitLab, that matters little for a firm growing earnings at such a rapid clip.\n\n4. SoFi (SOFI) the Social Finance (SoFi stock) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis week, Louis’ team also highlights SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) as a company where Wall Street May Soon Turn Back to Bullish. The New Year’s selloff has pushed SoFi’s shares back into the $8 range, and a potentially strong earnings release due on Jan. 29 could send shares higher:\n\nThe next big event for SOFI stock is just a few weeks away. That would be the release of the company’s Q4/full year 2023 results, post-market on Jan. 29…\n\nMuch suggests that SoFi will crush it again with results this quarter, as it did last quarter. With the student loan moratorium lifted and SoFi’s non-student lending operations growing, the company is likely to report its first profitable quarter.\n\nThe online banking firm has seen a strong upward revision in earnings. Over the past quarter, analysts have doubled their 2024 earnings per share estimates from 3 cents to 6 cents. 2025 earnings expectations are now as high as 23 cents.\n\nThat’s because banks (and fintechs) tend to benefit when rates are elevated, since they can earn higher risk-free interest on customer deposits. SoFi also lacks a corporate-lending business, which tend to see fewer benefits of rising rates.\n\nAnalysts expect SoFi’s net interest income (the profits generated from this lending activity) to more than double this fiscal year to $1.3 billion, eclipsing the revenues earned from other activities.\n\n5. DraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings (DKNG) logo, magnified, on its app.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher/Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Faisal Humayun hones in on DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) this week at InvestorPlace.com as a stock Primed to Explode Your Net Worth by 2030. The firm has a strong business, Humayun says, and is supported by industry tailwinds:\n\nDraftKings has surged by 183% in the last 12 months. The rally from deeply oversold levels is likely to sustain with profitability on the horizon. Further, with a big addressable market for online sports betting (OSB) and iGaming, I believe that DKNG stock will continue to create value.\n\nEssentially, DraftKings is rising on a wave of gambling legalizations. U.S. governors are seeing how states like New York are plugging funding gaps with new gaming tax revenues. And everyone wants a piece.\n\nSince October, analysts have revised their next-year earnings estimates for DraftKings from negative 50 cents to negative 26 cents, a 50% improvement. And 2025 figures are up even more; Wall Street now expects DraftKings to earn a positive 80 cents per share by the end of the year.\n\nTogether, the numbers suggest that DraftKings still has more room to run. Humayun expects margins to continue expanding for the next 12 to 24 months. If that’s the case, shares have at least another 22% upside from here.\n\nBeating the Market\n\nWall Street analysts are generally quite good at their work. Many have million-dollar research budgets at their disposal, and top analysts often know corporate bosses on a personal level.\n\nLouis and I are former Wall Streeters, and we’ve both seen this “old boys club” in action. It’s no surprise to either of us how powerful earnings revisions can be.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts also can make mistakes. In January 2023, analysts had just slashed their expectations for Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). As a group, Wall Street expected Meta’s earnings to decline 12.5% the following year.\n\nBut they were wrong. Meta would instead see a resurgence in the ad industry and the rise of generative AI. Earnings would instead rise 60% for 2023, sending shares up 145%. 2023 also saw other surprises, including resurgences in U.S. chipmaking and homebuilders. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) would see similarly unexpected turnarounds. No matter how skilled analysts are, some things are exceedingly difficult to predict.\n\nSo, what if you could beat Wall Street at its own game?\n\nTo do that, Louis has teamed up with earnings season expert Landon Swan reveal a revolutionary AI program with the power to predict the future earnings of more than 500 companies with uncanny accuracy. Full details here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 40 highest-paying jobs without a degree in the US. We have also discussed the employment statistics in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest-Paying Jobs Without a Degree in the US.\n\nIn a world where higher education often seems like the key to unlocking success, a paradigm shift is taking place. The traditional narrative of pursuing a degree as the sole gateway to a professional career is being challenged, giving rise to a multitude of high-paying job opportunities for individuals who opt for alternative paths.\n\nFor example, air traffic controller is one of the jobs that pay 100k a year without a degree. Then there are profitable professions like professional athletes as they have 6 figure jobs without college degree. Sommeliers and animators are two of the most unique jobs that pay well without a degree.\n\nUnemployment Landscape in the US\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor, in the week ending January 13, 2024,  seasonally adjusted initial unemployment claims dropped to 187,000, a decrease of 16,000 from the previous week and reaching the lowest level since September 24, 2022. The 4-week moving average also decreased to 203,250, down by 4,750. The seasonally adjusted insured unemployment rate remained unchanged at 1.2%, with insured unemployment decreasing by 26,000 to 1,806,000. The unadjusted data showed 289,228 actual initial claims, a 9.3% decrease from the previous week.\n\nThe total number of continued weeks claimed for benefits in all programs as of December 30 was 2,129,892. The report also highlighted specific state data, indicating New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Minnesota have the highest insured unemployment rates, while New York experienced the largest increase in initial claims, contrasting with decreases in New Jersey and Massachusetts.\n\nIncreased Hiring in 2024\n\nIn a recent survey conducted by Robert Half, it has been revealed that more than half of US companies are planning to increase hiring in the first half of 2024. The State of US Hiring Survey indicates that 57% of respondents plan to add new permanent positions, while an additional 39% anticipate hiring for vacated positions. Moreover, 67% of companies are expected to hire contract workers as part of their staffing strategy. The primary driver for this surge in hiring is attributed to company growth, with 66% of managers citing it as the main factor influencing their decisions. Despite the positive outlook, hiring challenges persist, as 90% of hiring managers report difficulty finding skilled professionals, and 58% state that it takes longer to hire for open roles compared to the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe survey also highlighted the importance of companies implementing retention plans, with 91% of managers expressing concerns about retaining top talent. While hiring remains a priority, it is advised to focus on employee engagement and retention, incorporating strategies such as routine research and adjustment of compensation levels while also offering flexible work arrangements, and implementing policies to avoid burnout.\n\nWhat Companies Are Hiring in 2024?\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is set to embark on a hiring spree in 2024, rebounding from a period of layoffs in late 2022 and early 2023 that affected tens of thousands of employees. The company is gearing up to increase payroll expenses, anticipating growth and a shift towards higher-cost technical roles. Mark Zuckerberg has signaled to an ambitious commitment to investing in cutting-edge initiatives, particularly the metaverse. The company is prepared to incur operating losses, which also highlights its dedication to ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality.\n\nHowever, it is also worth highlighting that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is reportedly set to eliminate or largely reduce the role of technical program managers (TPMs) in different organizations, following the recent elimination of the role at Instagram. This is part of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s ongoing effort to become more efficient, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's mandate for a \"Year of Efficiency.\" Last week, scores of TPMs at Instagram were informed that they must reapply and reinterview for available product-manager roles or face layoffs in March. The consolidation of TPM roles into product-manager roles across Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is expected to impact hundreds of jobs. Since the initiation of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s efficiency measures, more than 20% of its staff has been laid off.\n\nOn the other hand, other tech giants like Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) are also bouncing back from earlier layoffs.

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 5 Top Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Investing is a long-term game. You win by finding great companies and then buying and holding them. Your investment will grow in value as the underlying businesses grow.\n\nSo, how do you apply that mindset to technology stocks, where it's often a matter of disrupting your competition or being disrupted? It can be tricky, but there are bonafide winners with the size and fundamentals to continue thriving for years.\n\nHere are five of the very best companies in the tech sector. Consider adding these to a diversified portfolio, and you'll get richer while sleeping well at night.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a hot trend on Wall Street. Still, AI will likely grow and develop over the coming decades. Chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has quickly established itself as the chip kingpin of this new era. Its graphics processing chips specialize in demanding applications, and that natural fit catapulted the company to an estimated AI chip market share between 80% and 95%.\n\nIt's hard to see Nvidia completely losing that market share, even if competitors chip away at it over time. The companies investing in AI are spending billions of dollars, which could make it harder to get them to switch from what's already working. AI unlocked a new level of growth at Nvidia last year, but AI's long-term potential means that the stock should enjoy years of growth.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nModern technology is built on the cloud -- centralized servers and data centers that shift computing power off organizations' premises. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) might have built its reputation on e-commerce, but its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, is the world's leader. That makes the stock a no-brainer long-term buy and hold.\n\nToday, Amazon holds nearly a third of the global cloud platform market, meaning that most of your online web activity at least touches AWS at one point or another. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow by 20% annually through the decade's end, which will almost certainly trickle to AWS. Add in Amazon's other business units, and the future looks bright.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nData has arguably become the critical resource companies and governments crave in this modern world. Data helps companies know their customers, themselves, and their competitors. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has arguably the most data of any company on Earth thanks to its decades of dominance in Google Search and YouTube. These are the world's two most heavily trafficked sites.\n\nFor investors, Alphabet's massive audience gives it many billions of dollars in high-margin advertising revenue, which helped the company bring in over $77 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months alone. The company's data, deep pockets, and AI potential mean that Alphabet will likely leverage itself into years of growth ahead.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nSocial media has become a regular part of daily life for people worldwide, and nobody does it better than Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). The company owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, making money by showing ads to the 3.96 billion people using its apps monthly. The company's a cash cow, generating $37 billion in cash flow over the past year, and invests heavily into new opportunities, like AI and the metaverse via Reality Labs.\n\nStudies have shown that social media is addictive, which, admittedly, probably isn't great for its users' mental health but makes Meta Platforms' core business very sticky. While many of the world's largest companies are led by outsiders, Meta is still headed by its co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who is only 39. He's built the company into the tech giant it is today, so long-term investors should feel great about Meta's future.\n\n5. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCybersecurity has become one of the most critical pieces of any corporate budget. Getting hacked or suffering a data breach can cost a company millions in financial and reputational damage. CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) is part of a new generation of security companies, leaning on AI and cloud technology to provide security that learns in real-time, something legacy solutions like antivirus software can't match.\n\nCrowdStrike is by far the youngest company on this list, but it's established itself as a leader in its field. Notably, the business is already quite profitable despite still chasing revenue growth. More than 23,000 organizations use CrowdStrike, which sells its products in modules. Customers buy access to more modules as CrowdStrike expands its offerings, leading to durable growth from adding new customers and cross-selling to existing ones. Cybersecurity isn't going anywhere, making CrowdStrike a security leader to hold onto.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Great, But These 3 Semiconductor Stocks Are Even Better",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks are increasingly coming into focus for growth investors looking to amplify their returns.\n\nIndeed, looking at Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) performance on a year-to-date (YTD) basis (and really over almost any time frame), it’s clear that investors are focusing on long-term growth trends for the coming decade. As data usage grows, the demand for computing power will exponentially rise. Accordingly, Nvidia has become the focal point of most investors’ chip exposure.\n\nAnd yet, investors should consider plenty of other semiconductor stocks, given the potential market size. Estimates include a projected market value of $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, other stocks look poised to provide big returns over time. Given the rise of AI, machine learning, and quantum computing, check out these stocks that are set to see gains.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been hot lately, with its stock similarly surging to all-time highs. Investors who seek the “next Nvidia” find promise in AMD as a compelling alternative. The company has a strong market position and a new AI GPU challenging Nvidia.\n\nLaunched in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT reshaped perceptions of AI capabilities. Nvidia dominated as the main chip supplier to this endeavor and others. In fact, it underscored AMD’s lag in the AI race.\n\nHowever, AMD has since responded with the MI300X AI GPU, on par with Nvidia’s H100 for training and 10% to 20% superior for inference. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) partnerships further bolster AMD’s AI future.\n\nDespite hitting a $160 high and a 127% increase over the last year, AMD’s potential ascent extends into 2024. The company’s Q3 revenue came in at $5.8 billion, up 4% year over year (YOY), suggesting a continuing positive trend. Now, AMD is looking at record revenue. While not mirroring Nvidia’s rally, AMD’s appeal to top tech firms positions it well for significant market share gains over the long-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn January 18, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) surpassed Q4 earnings estimates, reporting $1.44 per U.S. share on $19.62 billion in sales. Despite four consecutive quarters of declining revenue, TSM anticipates a return to growth this quarter, overcoming challenges in smartphone and automobile chip demand.\n\nIn Q1, TSMC anticipates revenue between $18 billion and $18.8 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s $18.27 billion target. The company’s Q4 success was driven by the robust 3-nanometer technology ramp-up. CFO Wendell Huang expects Q1 impact from smartphone seasonality, balanced by sustained high-performance computing demand.\n\nThe chipmaker projects 2024 revenue to surge more than 20% due to high demand for AI-centric high-end chips. Needham analyst Charles Shi noted TSMC’s outlook slightly exceeds Wall Street expectations. This suggests a prolonged downturn and a slower-than-normal cycle recovery in 2024. Also, it makes TMC stock a semiconductor option worth considering right now.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology’s (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares surged 5.7% following TMC’s robust Q4 earnings results. It really provided a rising tide that lifted all boats (AMD also surged following these impressive forward forecasts). Despite not being a leader in terms of semiconductor stocks, Marvell Technology has nearly doubled from its 52-week low. And, it continues to provide plenty of strong upward momentum for investors.\n\nMRVL is an outside option in the chip race, with higher potential upside. Indeed, if one takes the view that this entire sector should get a boost from surging chip sales, MRVL could have greater upside than its mega-cap counterparts. Investors and traders will want to look for higher-beta ways to play this trade. The company certainly looks intriguing in this right.\n\nAlso, Marvell Technology trades at a higher discount to its peers, with a more attractive valuation multiple. Still off its all-time highs, this company presents a compelling option for value-oriented growth investors in this current environment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Outperform the Magnificent 7 Stocks in 2024",
        "content": "The Magnificent Seven stocks are the new FAANG. Unsurprisingly, many members of the FAANG cohort are a part of the Magnificent Seven. The large tech companies that comprise this group have consistently paced and outperformed the market. Investors would have been very happy to start positions in any of the Magnificent Seven stocks ten years ago.\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks offer a vision of possibilities for long-term investors, new stocks are emerging. Some equities have outperformed the Magnificent Seven stocks without much fanfare. But, that can change within a few years.\n\nTherefore, investors looking for high-potential stocks may want to consider these three growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCloudflare (NET) The logo of Cloudflare, (NET) an US web infrastructure & security company, its website on iOS.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) and the other stocks on this list have 1-year and 5-year returns that would make most of the Magnificent Seven stocks jealous. Additionally, NET offers content delivery network services and keeps websites safe from cyberattacks.\n\nSwitching out of any content delivery network or cybersecurity service takes considerable time. Furthermore, if the results are good, business owners will just stick with the platform. Cloudflare has done a great job at retaining customers and attracting new ones. That dynamic helped the company achieve 32% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth and narrow its net losses.\n\nThe stock has gained 83% over the past year and is up by 333% over the past five years. A switch to profitability and continued revenue growth can send the stock much higher in the long run. It’s normal for high-potential companies to not be profitable right away. It took Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) almost a decade to become profitable.\n\nCloudflare has accelerated its efforts into artificial intelligence and has entered into several partnerships. AI can fuel more revenue growth for the company and help its stock outperform the Magnificent Seven.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a cloud networking company with a long history of beating the market. Further, shares have gained 131% over the past year and are up by 353% over the past five years. The firm has a 34-forward P/E ratio.\n\nCorporations use Arista Networks to keep their sensitive data safe and become more efficient. ANET has over 8,000 cloud customers worldwide including large corporations like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThese companies should stick around for many years since their products need solutions from companies like Arista Networks to function smoothly. Investment management firm Giverny Capital mentioned that the computing power for an AI chat query is “roughly seven times more than for a Google or Bing search.”\n\nArista Networks has continued to delight investors with its earnings reports. The company reported 28.3% YOY revenue growth in the third quarter. Net income went up by 54.1% YOY. Those growth rates and the tremendous AI runway can help Arista Networks reward long-term investors.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is riding the wave of a 74% 1-year gain and a 290% increase over the past five years. In fact, investors are excited about the stock and have bid it up to a $153 billion market cap.\n\nServiceNow offers cloud computing technology that helps organizations run more efficiently and manage data. The company has over 7,700 customers. Additionally, 49 of those customers have annual contract values above $20 million. Also, NOW has nearly 1,800 customers with annual contract values exceeding $1 million.\n\nMost of the company’s customers remain, which means high revenue and earnings growth. ServiceNow reported 25% YOY revenue growth in the third quarter and more than tripled its net income during the same period.\n\nFinally, net profit margins have been expanding nicely and reached double-digits in Q3. Thus, ServiceNow has outperformed most of the Magnificent Seven stocks and looks poised to continue that trend in 2024 and beyond.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NET, ANET, and NOW.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 S&P 500 stocks on the move. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 S&P 500 Stocks On the Move.\n\nThe United States economy has continued to defy expectations of a macro slowdown over the past few months and looks set to grow at a healthy pace in the first quarter of 2024. Recent figures from the Labor and Commerce departments in the US government indicate that jobs are being added to the economy at a brisk pace and strong retail sales, especially in motorsports and online purchases, have forced experts to revise growth estimates upwards. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier this week the economy was doing well and this had given the central bank some flexibility to move carefully on monetary policy.\n\nIn the first employment report of the new year, the Labor Department revealed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 216,000 jobs in December, beating forecasts by around 36,000 jobs. Per the latest data, the economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2023, down from 4.8 million in 2022. The decline should be seen in context of the 525 basis points worth of rate hikes by the Fed since the second quarter of 2022. Leisure, business, government, and manufacturing all registered increases in jobs. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in December, matching the gain in November. This raised the year-on-year increase in wages to 4.1% from 4.0% in November.\n\nThe Consumer Inflation report released by the Commerce Department also boosted investor confidence in the market. Retail sales climbed 0.6% in December after a 0.3% gain in November, beating forecasts that retail sales would only gain 0.4%. Sales increased 5.6% on a year-on-year basis in the month of December. The latest growth figures have forced experts to revise expectations of a rate cut in March to 55% from 65%. The benchmark indexes, like the S&P 500, seem unaffected by these moves, largely trading flat over the past month, as the dollar rises and Treasury values fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the S&P 500 stocks on the move as the new year gets underway include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA). Investors should closely monitor these stocks in the next few weeks to take advantage of upcoming growth catalysts. Gary Guthart, the CEO of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), recently outlined during the third quarter earnings call that his firm was focused on expanding internationally and bringing down the cost of products for newer platforms.\n\n“Areas of opportunity include our Ion program, our SP accessories portfolio, and our multiport accessories and advanced instrument lines. Given the timing of facilities completion, manufacturing efficiency improvements for new products, and other complex projects, we expect variability in gross margin over the coming quarters as we work through these programs. Turning to our digital offerings. [inaudible] for digital tools and channels is growing nicely.\n\nOur SimNow surgical simulators are installed at the majority of our customer sites, and subscription renewal rates are outstanding. Routine use of My Intuitive app by over 10,000 da Vinci surgeons grew by 140% year over year and is receiving strong Net promoter scores that continue improving over time. Our Intuitive Hub media management and telepresence system installations grew 58% in the quarter, and the hub-captured surgical cases grew 61%. In closing, core demand is healthy.\n\nWe're focused on extending our ecosystem internationally and driving our product costs down, particularly for our newer platforms. We are dogged in pursuit of significant long-term opportunity to improve the Quadruple Aim using our integrated ecosystem powered by analytics, and we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. \" S&P 500 Stocks On the Move\n\nPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThese thirty best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 over the past month were shortlisted and the top twelve selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nS&P 500 Stocks On the Move\n\n12. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 6.2%\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a biotech firm that develops therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) shares have rallied since the firm announced earlier this month that Casgevy, a gene therapy developed by the firm, had been approved by Saudi Arabian regulators for the treatment of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia in people aged 12 years or older. The company noted that Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of the genetic blood disorders in the world.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX), compared to 54 in the previous quarter worth $1.9 billion.\n\nJust like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is one of the S&P 500 stocks on the move.\n\nIn its Q2 2023 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Notable adds in the quarter included Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) and Intuit. Vertex is one of the only pharmaceutical companies in the world with an effective drug for cystic fibrosis, but the market has deemed it a slow-growth company due to existing market penetration. However, the drug is enabling patients to live longer, and the drug’s patient base is growing. Also, the company is developing a more potent formulation that we believe could increase efficacy while giving Vertex an opportunity to reprice and improve margins. Finally, its cystic fibrosis franchise is very cash generative, and the company has been using the capital to invest in a pipeline that we believe includes some interesting longer term opportunities. We added to the position after a couple of positive developments this quarter. First, its competitive position strengthened when a competitor, AbbVie, announced it will discontinue all work in cystic fibrosis. Second, there have been positive developments from the company’s pipeline, including encouraging early-stage results for a Type 1 diabetes stem cell therapy.”\n\n11. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 6.3%\n\nFastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)engages in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) stock has surged after the firm posted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023, beating market estimates on earnings per share and revenue by $0.01 and $10 million respectively. The firm also announced a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 33 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $529 million in Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST), compared to 31 the preceding quarter worth $653 million.\n\n10. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 234\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 9%\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a tech firm that owns and runs social media platforms. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock has climbed in the past few weeks as analysts expect the company to beat market estimates on revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 despite headwinds like job cuts, TikTok popularity, and lawsuits. The firm has been capitalizing on catalysts like artificial intelligence innovations, secular digital ad trends and a leaner cost structure, according to analyst Brian White at investment firm Monness Crespi.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 234 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $35 billion in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 225 in the preceding quarter worth $30 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Weitz Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“As for other quarterly contributors, Alphabet, Inc., (GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) added to their exceptional year-to-date returns. Meta Platforms and Alphabet were the true year-to-date standouts. After steep declines in 2022, both stocks rebounded sharply due to a combination of solid fundamentals, disciplined operational execution, and improved sentiment. Despite outsized gains and attention, we think both Alphabet and Meta remain undervalued.”\n\n9. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 9.5%\n\nMcKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) provides healthcare services. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) stock has been on the move in the past few weeks on the back of reports that the company is planning to sell the Rexall pharmacy chain it owns in Canada. The former acquired the latter in a deal worth more than $2 billion in 2016. Rexall operates around 400 pharmacies in Canada.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based firm Viking Global is a leading shareholder in McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) with 1.4 million shares worth more than $633 million.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Partially offsetting the above was favorable stock selection in pharmaceuticals and health care distributors along with cash exposure in a declining market. Strength in pharmaceuticals and health care distributors was driven by gains from Lilly and McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK). McKesson’s stock performed well due to strong financial results in the company’s pharmaceutical distribution and prescription technology solutions businesses, driven in part by higher volumes of GLP-1 medicines and prior authorization technology services related to GLP-1 medicines.”\n\n8. ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 10.5%\n\nANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) develops and markets engineering simulation software and services worldwide. ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) stock has rallied on the back of reports that the firm would be acquired by software firm Synopsys in a deal worth $35 billion. On January 16, these reports were confirmed by the latter. The combined company expects to achieve nearly $400 million of run-rate cost synergies by year three post-closing and around $400 million of run-rate revenue synergies by year four post-closing, growing to more than $1 billion annually in the longer-term.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Impax Asset Management is a leading shareholder in ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) with 640,715 shares worth more than $190 million.\n\n7. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 85\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 10.7%\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)operates as a healthcare company worldwide. Earlier this month, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced that drug authorities in the United States had approved Keytruda, an oncology drug developed by the firm, in combination with chemoradiotherapy, for the treatment of FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA cervical cancer. The approval has increased investor confidence in the famous drugmaker that recently acquired immunotherapy developer Harpoon Therapeutics in a deal worth $680 million.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 85 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5 billion in Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), compared to 78 in the previous quarter worth $2.6 billion.\n\n6. Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43\n\nReturn Over Past Month as of January 18: 12.6%\n\nViatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) makes and sells generic drugs. Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) shares have climbed over the past few days after the firm presented future growth plans at the JPMorgan Health Conference, detailing that it plans to generate more than $2.3 billion in free cash flow over the next three to five years. It also revealed that it would reinvest 50% of the free cash flow into the business while the rest would be given to shareholders in quarterly dividends and share buybacks.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $952 million in Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS), up from 42 in the preceding quarter worth $1.1 billion.\n\nIn addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) is one of the S&P 500 stocks on the move.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Davis Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the attractive healthcare sector, we look beyond the obvious to identify businesses that simultaneously have exposure to this growth industry and also trade at low prices. We’re especially drawn to companies like Viatris, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices. Furthermore, recognizing that the constantly rising cost of healthcare cannot go on forever, we have been particularly drawn to companies whose products or services play some role in managing or reducing the cost of care. As a result, we have positions in Viatris, a leading manufacturer of low-cost branded generic drugs.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 S&P 500 Stocks On the Move.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 12 Recent Additions 12 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit 14 Cheap DRIP Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has long been known as an operational genius, not a product genius, which makes this technological innovation potentially legacy-defining.\n\nWith this new hot product, the spotlight is now on Apple, and the question looms whether Vision Pro can give a boost to its sales to justify its roughly 30 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nThe Vision Pro, priced at $3,499, is positioning itself as a high-end competitor in the market. This places it at seven times the cost of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset priced at $500.\n\nThe significant price difference raises questions about the features and capabilities that justify Vision Pro’s premium positioning compared to Meta’s offering. Price was called out by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg, who reportedly said Apple's vision is \"not the one [he] wants.\"\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), a key and established player in the VR space, introduced its first virtual-reality headset, the Oculus Quest, in 2019. Its latest release, the Quest 3, hit the market in October, further intensifying competition in the VR sector.\n\nTrending: How to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024? These investors have the latest tips.\n\nMETA saw significant success in 2023, with a remarkable 128% increase in share price. It continues to hold strong in the early days of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut several industry giants have competing views on what the metaverse is and should be. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., which owns the rights to the popular book and movie \"Ready Player One,\" recently announced a new VR venture. Ready Player One is set in a dystopian future where humanity has largely lost hope in the real world. As such, people have retreated to the OASIS, a metaverse so integral the virtual currency is more valuable than the real deal.\n\nDespite the book outlining a bleak and dystopian future, Warner Bros. has begun development of a Ready Player One-based metaverse. Oddly, this venture is at the approval and direction of the author of the \"Ready Player One\" series Ernest Cline.\n\nThe move comes as companies continue to integrate virtual and augmented reality features into their existing business plans. Amazon.com Inc. recently launched augmented reality shopping, The Walt Disney Co. launched a virtual reality division, and Meta continues to pioneer within the space.\n\nMetaverse startups saw roughly $500 million raised from venture capital in 2023. While this is a far cry from larger funding areas like AI, it still represents a shift in investments. As larger players continue to make investments and build products in the space, it will likely play a larger role in everyday life. Someday, people might even be able to experience Ready Player One virtual reality and actual reality.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDiscover why high-profile names like Leonard Dicaprio are turning to diamond assets and how you can get involved with just $100.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Investors to Follow on Twitter and Social Media.\n\nMorgan Stanley Bullish on Diversified, Alpha Hedge Fund Portfolios\n\nOn December 31, 2023, Morgan Stanley reported that falling inflation levels are expected to be sluggishly above bank targets ahead of 2024. Such may lead to price dispersion and provide hedge fund alpha opportunities across asset classes. Throughout 2024, the Fed is expected to ease monetary policy which may eventually push wide discrepancies among winners and losers. While an easing cycle coupled with higher interest rates may increase volatility in bond prices, hedge funds may be able to benefit from higher interest rates, especially with derivative-based investing strategies. Morgan Stanley is bullish on diversified and alpha hedge fund portfolios in the current environment. The market is uncertain and the outlook for 2024 seems unclear, which may be a hint towards avoiding big and risky bets.\n\nTop Stock Picks of Hedge Funds\n\nInstitutional investors are heavily positioned in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc.

To commence with our research we first established certain parameters to define a niche for our list. Therefore, our list consists of popular hedge fund managers that primarily own a Twitter account, and other social media channels if available. We first consulted four reports on the internet including Forbes, Benzinga, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance. We then applied certain filters on LinkedIn using keywords such as \"hedge fund manager\" to ensure we did not miss any important names. Finally, we also looked up founding members and owners of popular hedge funds. This thorough process enabled us to come up with 55 hedge fund managers. We then conducted a manual search to find the Twitter account of every investor along with other social media such as LinkedIn and Instagram, if available. Moreover, we consulted Forbes to extract profiles and the net worth of each investor.\n\nIt is to be noted that while we intended to include hedge fund managers with a significant social media presence, some of the most popular names in the hedge fund industry do not own Twitter accounts. For such investors, we have ranked them earlier in the list based on their social media presence on any other social media site such as Linkedin, Instagram, or YouTube.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Stock Still a Buy After Hitting a New 52-Week High?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) was one of the S&P 500's hottest stocks last year, rising by an impressive 194% in 2023. It bounced back in a big way after a disappointing 2022 when its share price tanked by 64%.\n\nThe stock still shows no sign of slowing down as it recently hit new 52-week highs. Is Meta Platforms' stock going to generate strong returns yet again this year, or is now the time for investors to consider cashing out?\n\nWhy Meta Platforms stock continues to rally\n\nInvestors became bearish on Meta Platforms' business in 2022 as a weak ad market resulted in lackluster sales growth for the company. Towards the end of the year, the company struggled to generate any growth at all. But in recent quarters and amid a more favorable outlook for the economy, the business has been rebounding -- in a big way. META Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nWith revenue growth back above 20%, Meta has convinced investors that it's still a top growth stock to own. One thing that could derail these numbers, however, is if the ad market slows down. In the latest quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, 2023, Meta reported that ad impressions on its family of apps segment (which includes Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook) grew 31% year over year, but the average price per ad declined by 6%.\n\nThat's a fairly high growth rate in ad impressions and may be unsustainable. Other factors that may have influenced that strong growth include companies moving away from TikTok due to government bans and X (formerly known as Twitter) due to policy changes, and spending their ad money on Facebook and Instagram instead. But that kind of growth may be a bit too optimistic to continue to expect this year, especially if a recession takes place and companies scale back their ad spending.\n\nIs Meta Platforms stock too expensive?\n\nDue to Meta's run-up in price over the past year, the stock is now trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 33. That's a high multiple compared with the stock's five-year average, which includes some heavy discounts in 2022.\n\nStory continues META PE Ratio Chart\n\nOn Wall Street, the consensus analyst price target is about $358 -- slightly below its current price -- indicating that analysts may be worried about how much more upside could be left for Meta's stock this year.\n\nIs Meta Platforms stock still a buy in 2024?\n\nIf you've made a good profit on Meta Platforms over the past year, now may be a good time to consider selling the stock. At a near $1 trillion valuation, Meta looks overpriced given that its growth rate may be unsustainable; investors are currently paying a steep multiple which prices in a lot of future earnings growth, which is by no means a certainty.\n\nTo make matters worse, Meta also has a cash-burning metaverse segment, Reality Labs (it incurred operating losses totaling $11.5 billion over the first nine months of 2023), which could be a drag on its bottom line for years to come.\n\nIf Meta were to maintain a 20% growth rate or better for the long haul, the stock's price could prove to be justifiable. But I'm not optimistic that the company can continue to grow at such a high rate, which is why I believe long-term investors are better off looking elsewhere for good growth stocks to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shareholders have earned a 175% return over the last year",
        "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But if you pick the right stock, you can make a lot more than 100%. For example, the Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) share price has soared 175% return in just a single year. It's also good to see the share price up 22% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 14% in 90 days). It is also impressive that the stock is up 40% over three years, adding to the sense that it is a real winner.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nMeta Platforms was able to grow EPS by 8.1% in the last twelve months. The share price gain of 175% certainly outpaced the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is now more optimistic about the stock.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nThis free interactive report on Meta Platforms' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 175% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 21%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Meta Platforms better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with Meta Platforms .\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course Meta Platforms may not be the best stock to buy.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the22 Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks.\n\nHedge funds on average underperformed the market in 2023 as investors continued to pull out money amid rise in bond yields, overall volatility and a changing financial landscape. But the $3.4 trillion hedge fund industry saw many blockbuster returns from select hedge funds. For example, SoMa Equity Partners posted a massive 62% gain in 2023, according to a Reuters report. Many notable hedge funds like Coatue Management of Philippe Laffont, Millennium Management of billionaire Israel Englander,  Anson Funds' Investments Master fund posted double-digit returns. Chase Coleman's Tiger Global, which was devastated in 2022 due to its tech investments, rebounded strongly in 2023 and posted  a 28.5% gain in the period, with most of the gains coming in the last quarter of the year, helped largely by tech stocks. While there's no shortage of hedge funds that performed extremely poorly during the year, you have funds like Mulvaney Capital Management which reportedly posted a 51.22% return, according to Reuters.\n\nThis mixed bag of results and the average underperformance of the hedge fund industry when compared to the S&P 500's strong returns in 2023 only prove Insider Monkey's long-held thesis about the hedge fund industry, recently summarized by its founder and research director Dr. Inan Dogan:\n\n\"Hedge funds, usually, underperform the market during bull markets and outperform during bear markets. Most investors don’t understand that hedge funds are “hedged”. When the S&P 500 Index returns 20+% like it did in 2021, it is a certainty that hedge funds will underperform. It is also a certainty that hedge funds will significantly outperform the market when the market declines 18.2% like it did in 2022. Hedge funds lost 4.25% in 2022 according to HFR. That’s an outperformance of 14 percentage points. \"\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks\n\n22. Israel Englander\n\nTop Stock Pick: Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nIsrael \"Izzy\" Englander founded Millennium Management in 1989 with Ronald Shear. As of 2023 the fund has a whopping $61 billion worth of assets under management. The hedge fund operates relative value, equity arbitrage, fixed income and quantitative strategies.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the biggest position of Millennium Management as the fund had a $1.6 billion stake in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT):\n\n“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the largest holding in our portfolio. Given its partnership with OpenAI and leading position in the cloud, Microsoft is well-positioned to profit from the boom in AI. However, due to Microsoft’s tremendous scale and diversification, the company is not dependent upon AI for its success. Microsoft’s diverse portfolio of software and cloud offerings ensures the company will thrive even if the next hot thing, like AI, fizzles out. In this way, Microsoft is emblematic of our broader investing approach. We seek to benefit from powerful trends, but we do so with an eye toward managing risk and limiting downside in case the future turns out to be less rosy than hoped for.”\n\n21. Ken Griffin\n\nTop Stock Pick: Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX)\n\nWorth about $35 billion today, Ken Griffin started Citadel LLC back in 1990. As of December 2022, the fund had assets under management worth over $62 billion.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Microsoft was the biggest position of the fund but since it would be a repetition, we focus on the fund's second-biggest holding, Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX). Citadel had a $1.1 billion stake in Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX).\n\nBaron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added to our position in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. We wrote about Boston Scientific last quarter. We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products used to treat atrial fibrillation, among others. The company held an Investor Day during the quarter at which management established financial targets for the 2024– 2026 period calling for an organic sales CAGR of 8% to 10%, 150 basis points of margin expansion and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improved free-cash-flow conversion. We think this growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.”\n\n20. John Paulson\n\nTop Stock Pick: Horizon Therapeutics Public Ltd Co. (NASDAQ:HZNP)\n\nJohn Paulson, who has a net worth of about $3.5 billion as of January 11, rose to fame in 2007 when he earned a whopping $4 billion, thanks to his bets against the U.S. subprime mortgage lending market via credit default swaps.\n\nPaulson founded Paulson & Co. in 1994. The hedge fund's biggest position as of the end of September was Horizon Therapeutics Public Ltd Co. (NASDAQ:HZNP) in which the fund had a $243 million stake.\n\n19. David Einhorn\n\nTop Stock Pick: Green Brick Partners Inc (NYSE:GRBK)\n\nDavid Einhorn founded Greenlight Capital in 1996. The fund returned 36.6% in 2022, easily outperforming the S&P 500’s fall of 18.1%. Since its launch in 1996, Greenlight Capital has returned 2,358.3% for an annualized return of 12.8% net. Over the same timeframe, the S&P 500 gained 864% for an annualized return of 8.9%.\n\nThe fund's biggest stock holding is Green Brick Partners Inc (NYSE:GRBK).\n\nHere is what Greenlight Capital has to say about Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) fell from $56.80 to $41.51 during the quarter. The company announced second quarter earnings of $1.63 per share, which far exceeded consensus estimates of $1.18 per share. Full-year estimates for 2023 and 2024 rose from $5.16 and $5.54 to $6.13 and $6.49, respectively. However, the market has become concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates, and most homebuilding stocks reversed a portion of the gains achieved earlier this year.”\n\n18. Jim Simons\n\nTop Stock Pick: Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\n\nJames Harris Simons is an American billionaire, award-winning mathematician and hedge fund manager who founded Renaissance Technologies in 1982. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, Jim Simons’ secretive Medallion Fund — closed for outsiders — posted a whopping $55 billion in profit over the last 28 years, about $10 billion more profitable than hedge funds of giants like Ray Dalio and George Soros.\n\nRenaissance Technologies' biggest stock holding as of the end of September 2023 was Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)in which the fund had a $1.5 million stake.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our health care holdings also fared well. The sector has been largely overlooked in 2023 amid AI exuberance, but its defensiveness is looking more salutary as tighter monetary policy begins to sap market sentiment. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) shares rose on continued unprecedented demand for GLP-1s, which treat diabetes and obesity, and of which Novo Nordisk is one of two major providers. GLP-1s represent the largest commercial opportunity and investable theme in health care.”\n\n17. Cathie Wood\n\nTop Stock Pick: Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nCathie Wood is one of the most followed hedge fund managers in the Wall Street and is known for her bets on innovative, high-growth companies. In 2014, Wood founded ARK Invest. Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund ($ARKK) rallied about 70% in 2023. This was the fund's third best performance in a year since its inception.\n\nThe biggest position of ARK Invest as of the end of September 2023 was Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in which the fund had a $1 billion stake.\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.”\n\n16. Guy Spier\n\nTop Stock Pick: Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class A (NYSE:BRK.A)\n\nGuy Spier has risen to fame over the past few years, thanks to his obsession with Warren Buffett and his value principles. The author of the famous value investing book The Education of a Value Investor famously paid $650,100 along with Mohnish Pabrai to have lunch with Warren Buffett.\n\nSpier founded the Aquamarine Fund after leaving investment banking career. The fund's biggest position as of the end of the third quarter was, you guessed it, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class A (NYSE:BRK.A) as the fund owned 140,600 shares of the conglomerate.\n\n15. Michael Burry\n\nTop Stock Pick: Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA)\n\nMichael Burry is almost always in the news thanks to his blunt predictions which often warn about recessions and market crashes. The Big Short investor rose to fame after he correctly bet against the housing bubble in 2007.\n\nIn 2000, Michael Burry founded Scion Capital. The fund's biggest stock holding as of the end of September was Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA) in which the fund had a $7.6 million stake.\n\n14. Leon Cooperman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Energy Transfer LP Unit (NYSE:ET)\n\nBillionaire Leon Cooperman is the chariman and CEO of Omega Advisors, which had about $1.9 billion under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe biggest stock holding of the fund was Energy Transfer LP Unit (NYSE:ET), in which the fund had a $167 million.\n\n13. Mario Gabelli\n\nTop Stock Pick: Herc Holdings Inc (NYSE:HRI)\n\nBillionaire Mario Gabelli is the man behind GAMCO Investors, Inc., formerly known as Gabelli Asset Management Company. Gabelli is a value investor and has impressed the market with high returns over the past several years. Talking to Columbia Business School, the 81-year-old investor talked about the essence of value investing:\n\n\"Value investing isn’t focused on short-term market movements. It’s about finding the ignored and unloved companies that nobody covers for whatever reason, with a good business, solid management, and a good price. But you do need to evaluate new trends as they come up. AI, for example, might accelerate the problem of income inequality. Also, there are food, water, and energy shortages. There’s the way capital is allowed to be allocated on a global basis — the regulatory hurdles and the challenges to the free market’s system of allocation. So you have to figure out how to bridge all that.\"\n\nThe biggest stock holding of GAMCO as of the end of the third quarter of 2023 was Herc Holdings Inc (NYSE:HRI).\n\n12. David Tepper\n\nTop Stock Pick: Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper is the man behind Appaloosa Management, a Florida-based hedge fund. Tepper, who also owns Carolina Panthers, managed to post about 18% to 19% gains in 2023, according to a report by Institutional Investor.\n\nTepper's top two holdings as of the end of September were Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). But since these two stocks are already mentioned in our article as the top picks of other hedge funds, let's look at the third biggest position of the billionaire. Tepper's fund had a $477 million stake in the ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n“Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Nvidia. Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments, most notably its core e-commerce business, while Meta saw accelerated revenue growth and share gains in online advertising.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.”\n\n11. Paul Tudor Jones\n\nTop Stock Pick: Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI)\n\nBillionaire Paul Tudor Jones  founded Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980. As of the end of the September quarter the hedge fund had a portfolio worth about over $9 billion.\n\nThe biggest stake of the company was in Activision Blizzard which is now going under the ownership of Microsoft. Jones' fund had a $284 million stake in the company as of the end of the September quarter.\n\n10. Dan Loeb\n\nTop Stock Pick: PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG)\n\nDaniel Seth Loeb started Third Point in 1995. The fund today has $10.8 billion in assets for sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, corporate & public pensions, high-net-worth individuals, and employees. The fund returned -2.2% on a NAV basis in September 2023, compared with a -4.3% return for the MSCI World Index and a -4.8% return for the S&P 500 Index.\n\nAs of the end of the September 2023 quarter, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) was the biggest position of the hedge fund. Third Point reported owning 57 million shares of the company.\n\n9. Bill Ackman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nBill Ackman is currently in the news for his relentless outburst against Harvard University and reports alleging his wife was involved in academic plagiarism. Regardless of this hullaballoo, Ackman is among the top money managers in the world, having started Pershing Square Capital in 2004. In 2023, Pershing returned  26.7%.\n\nAs of the end of the September quarter, the hedge fund's biggest position was Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (NYSE:CMG), in which the fund had a $1.7 billion stake. Over the past one year the stock has gained about 51%.\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the consumer discretionary sector, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) proved a detractor as investors were disappointed in management’s decision not to push additional menu pricing, which resulted in full year guidance falling short of expectations. However, we believe this is just a timing mismatch as their value proposition relative to peers leaves room for continued strong pricing power.”\n\n8. Ken Fisher\n\nTop Stock Pick:Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWorth $7.9 billion today, Ken Fisher is one of the most renowned hedge fund managers in the world. Ken Fisher founded Fisher Investments back in 1979. Fisher Investments today manages over $236 billion in assets. Ken Fisher is bullish on the market. He recently wrote in an article for that The Globe and Mail that he sees \"double-digit gains for both S&P 500 and the MSCI World Index, with tech and big growth stocks leading early on.\"\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest holding of Fisher Investments as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The fund owned a whopping $9.2 billion stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n“We meaningfully reduced our exposure to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2023. Apple is the largest company in the world and produces terrific products that engage users for hours each day. Despite the company’s size, ubiquity and relevance, however, Apple’s growth has slowed dramatically. Its fiscal 2023 earnings were flat with those of 2022. Apple trades at 30x earnings; sustaining that multiple will require a meaningful acceleration in revenues. While such an improvement is possible, we do not see any obvious catalysts for adding tens of billions of dollars to Apple’s topline. Consequently, the risk-reward skews negatively.”\n\n7. Ray Dalio\n\nTop Stock Pick: Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\n\nRay Dalio in 1975 founded Bridgewater Associates which went on to become the largest hedge fund in the world. According to Forbes, the hedge fund has over $124 billion in assets under management. According to Bloomberg, Bridgewater's flagship hedge fund lost about 7.6% in 2023, while its long-only All Weather fund climbed 10.6% in the period.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) was the biggest holding of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater as the fund reported owning a $700 million stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, Coca-Cola trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is likewise at ~27x P/E, with earnings only ~12% higher than a decade ago (or a ~1% annual growth rate). This equates to a mere 3.3% – 3.7% earnings yield.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”\n\n6. Chase Coleman\n\nTop Stock Pick: Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nHaving worked under legendary investor Julian Robertson, Chase Coleman rose to higher ranks in the money management industry with speed thanks to Robertson giving Coleman about $25 million after he shuttered his own fund Tiger Management. The famous tiger cub founded Tiger Global in 2001. According to Forbes, Coleman's worth today is about $5.7 billion.\n\nTiger Global's biggest stock position as of the end of September 2023 was Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), in which the fund had a $2.7 billion stake.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META):\n\n“Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and Nvidia. Amazon benefited from strong margin expansion across segments, most notably its core e-commerce business, while Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw accelerated revenue growth and share gains in online advertising.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5Most Famous Hedge Fund Managers and Their Top Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer's Recent Activist Targets and Top Stock Picks Cliff Asness Stock Portfolio: 10 Top Stock Picks Dan Loeb Stock Portfolio: 10 Top Stock Picks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: My Top 7 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "The macroeconomic challenges of the past couple of years are beginning to fade, and investors are looking to the future. After the Nasdaq Composite plunged in 2022, suffering its worst performance since 2008, the index enjoyed a robust recovery in 2023 and gained 43%.\n\nThere could be more to come. Since the Nasdaq Composite began trading in 1972, in every year following a market recovery, the tech-heavy index rose again -- and those second-year gains averaged 19%. The economy is the wildcard here, though, and it could yet stumble in 2024. But historical patterns suggest that this could be a good year for investors.\n\nRecent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) helped fuel the market's rise last year and will likely drive further gains in 2024. While estimates vary wildly, generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the next few years, according to a study by McKinsey Global Institute. This will result in windfalls for many companies in the field.\n\nHere are my top seven AI stocks to buy for 2024 before the Nasdaq reaches new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster child for AI innovation. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are already the industry standard chips in a growing number of AI use cases -- including data centers, cloud computing, and machine learning -- and it quickly adapted its processors for the needs of generative AI. Though it has been ramping up production, the AI chip shortage is expected to last until 2025 as demand keeps growing. The specter of competition looms, but thus far, Nvidia has stayed ahead of the competition by spending heavily on research and development.\n\nThe company's triple-digit percentage year-over-year growth is expected to continue into 2024. Despite its prospects, Nvidia remains remarkably cheap, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) helped jump-start the AI boom when it invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, shining a spotlight on generative AI. The company's tech peers jumped on the bandwagon, and the AI gold rush began. Microsoft seized the advantage, integrating OpenAI's technology into its Bing search and a broad cross-section of its cloud-based offerings.\n\nIts productivity-enhancing AI assistant, Copilot, could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027, according to some analysts, though estimates vary. This and other AI tools already caused Azure Cloud's growth to outpace rivals in Q3, and Microsoft attributed 3 percentage points of that growth to AI.\n\nThe stock is selling for 35 times forward earnings, a slight premium to the price-to-earnings ratio of 26 for the S&P 500. Even so, that looks attractive given Microsoft's growth potential.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has long used AI to improve its search results and the relevance of its digital advertising. The company was quick to recognize the potential of generative AI, imbuing many of its Google and Android products with increased functionality and announcing plans to add new AI tools to its search product. Furthermore, as the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider, Google Cloud is suited to offer AI systems to its customers.\n\nA collaboration between Google and Alphabet's AI research lab, DeepMind, gave birth to Gemini, which the company bills as its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Google Cloud's Vertex AI offers 130 foundational models that help users build and deploy generative AI apps quickly.\n\nAdd to that the ongoing rebound in its digital advertising business, and Alphabet's valuation of 27 times earnings seems like a steal.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nThere's a popular narrative that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was late to recognize the opportunities in AI, but the company's history tells a different story. Amazon continues to deploy AI to surface relevant products to shoppers, recommend viewing choices on Prime Video, schedule e-commerce deliveries, and predict inventory levels, among other uses. Most recently, Amazon began testing an AI tool designed to answer shoppers' questions about products.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) stocks all the most popular generative AI models for its cloud customers on Bedrock AI, and is also deploying its Inferentia and Trainium purpose-built AI chips for accelerating AI on its infrastructure.\n\nNow that inflation has slowed markedly, more consumers and businesses are patronizing Amazon, and AI will help boost its fortunes. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) also has a long and distinguished history of using AI to its advantage. From identifying and tagging people in photos to surfacing relevant content on its social media platforms, Meta has never been shy about deploying AI systems.\n\nUnlike some of its big tech rivals, Meta doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service to peddle its AI wares, but it quickly developed a workaround. After developing its open-source Llama AI model, Meta made it available on all the major cloud services -- for a price. Furthermore, Meta offers a suite of free AI-powered tools to help advertisers succeed.\n\nImproving economic conditions will no doubt boost its digital advertising business. And with the stock trading at just 22 times forward earnings, Meta is inexpensive relative to its opportunity.\n\n6. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has two decades of experience building AI-powered data analytics, and was ready to meet the challenge when AI went mainstream. In just months, the company added generative AI models to its portfolio, layering these atop its data analytics tools. The launch of the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has generated a lot of excitement. \"Demand for AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past 20 years,\" said management.\n\nWhen fears of a downturn were higher, businesses scaled back on most nonessential spending, including data analytics and AI services, but now, demand for those services is rebounding, particularly in relation to generative AI.\n\nLooking ahead one year, Palantir sports a PEG ratio of less than 1, which helps illustrate how cheap the stock really is.\n\n7. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) made a splash by bringing electric vehicles (EVs) into the mainstream. In 2023, its Model Y topped the list of the world's best-selling cars by a comfortable margin, the first EV to do so. However, the magnitude of its future prosperity will likely be linked to AI. The company's \"full self-drive\" system has yet to live up to its name, but success on that front would be a boon to shareholders.\n\nIn Ark Investment Management's Big Ideas 2023 report, the firm estimates that robotaxis could generate $4 trillion in revenue in 2027. With an estimated 2.7 million vehicles on the road collecting data, Tesla could hold an insurmountable technological edge, if it cracks the code on autonomous driving. Some analysts estimate the software is already worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nFinally, 6 times forward sales is a pretty reasonable valuation for an industry leader with a treasure trove of data.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJeff Bezos Investments in 2024: 11 Companies Bezos Is Investing In. To see more such companies, click Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: 5 Companies Bezos Is Investing In.\n\nRising interest rates and overall macroeconomic volatility kept a lid on startup funding in 2023 as investors remained in a wait and see mode about the future and preferred to invest in safe and already mature companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). A detailed report on the state of venture capital and future predictions from Cambridge Associates cited data from PitchBook which said that median change in valuations for follow-on financing rounds for early-stage companies in 2023 was 1.7x, the lowest change in any year since 2016. However, the Cambridge Associates report said that while 2023 was a bad year, low investments in 2022 and 2023 means there would be ample capital for VC funds to invest in worthy startups in 2024. The report also said most of the venture capital investments in 2024 would be directed towards AI. While Cambridge Associates said AI is not a new thing, it expects that the huge advancements in the domain after the generative AI boom would result in real innovation growth in the next few years.\n\nJeff Bezos' Thoughts on Innovation\n\nBut for innovation-focused billionaires like Jeff Bezos, who is worth about $177 billion as of January 20, the state of venture capital markets and what could happen in the next few months rarely matters. In an interview with senior tech writer Peter Burrows, Bezos said that there's no \"bad time\" to innovate when asked about Bezos' history of getting criticized for spending extravagantly on innovation.\n\n\"You should be doing it when times are good and when times are tough—and you want to be  doing it around things that your customers care about.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFood technology. Environment. Biotech. AI. Neurotechnology. These are the main themes in Jeff Bezos' investing philosophy as evident from his long list of investments.\n\nWhat matters to Bezos, according to him, is that his company is truly focusing on innovation and he tries not to get bogged down by stock price movements.\n\n\"We have three all-hands meetings a year, and I'll tell people that if the stock is up 30% this month, please don't feel you are 30% smarter. Because when the stock is down 30% a month from now, it's not going to feel that good to feel 30% dumber. When the Internet bubble burst, our stock went from over 100 a share to a low right after September 11 of 6. Throughout that entire period, the fundamentals of the business continuously improved. You can see the stock price going in the opposite direction of the fundamentals. So it wasn't that worrisome to us, \" Bezos said in the interview with Burrows.\n\nWhile Amazon's success over the years has proved that Bezos's innovation philosophy is right, it's interesting to take a look at the top investments of Jeff Bezos' investment company Bezos Expeditions. Billionaires like Bezos are always on the lookout to find new, promising startups in emerging domains that can grow to become giants in the future like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: Companies Bezos Is Investing In\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we took a look at Bezos Expeditions, Pitchbook, TechCrunch and some other reliable sources to find out which startups Bezos has been investing in. From these companies we selected 11 important companies in which Bezos invested in over the past few years. We gave preference to Bezos' most recent investments.\n\n11. Anthropic\n\nEven though Jeff Bezos is not a direct investor in Anthropic, the company behind ChatGPT rival AI assistant Claude, Anthropic deserves an entry in our list since Amazon decided to invest up to $4 billion in the company in 2023. According to the deal, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will initially invest $1.25 billion in Anthropic  and the investment would later be increased to $4 billion.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) management talked about Anthropic in its Q3 earnings call:\n\nRecently, we announced that leading LLM maker Anthropic chose AWS as its primary cloud provider and will use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train and deploy its future LLMs. As part of this partnership, AWS and Anthropic will collaborate on the future development of Trainium and Inferentia technology. We believe this collaboration will be helpful in continuing to accelerate the price performance advantages that Trainium and Inferentia deliver for customers. In the middle layer which we think of as large language models as a service, we recently introduced general availability for Amazon Bedrock which offers customers access to leading LLMs from third-party providers like Anthropic, Stability AI, coherent AI 21 as well as from Amazon’s own LLMs called Titan, where customers can take those models, customize them using their own data but without leaking that data back into the generalized LLM, have access to the same security, access control and features that they run the rest of their applications within AWS all through a managed service.\n\nIn the last couple of months, we’ve announced the imminent addition of Meta’s Llama 2 model to Bedrock, the first time it’s being made available through a fully managed service. Also through our expanded collaboration with Anthropic, customers will gain access to future Anthropic models through Bedrock with exclusive early access to unique features, model customization and the ability to fine-tune the models. And Bedrock has added several new compelling features, including the ability to create agents which can be programmed to accomplish tasks like answering questions or automating workflows. In these early days of generative AI, companies are still learning which models they want to use which models they use for what purposes and which model sizes they should use to get the latency and cost characteristics they desire.\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n10. Synchron\n\nNeurotechnology and brain  Synchron ranks 10th in our list of the companies Jeff Bezos has been investing in.  In 2022, Synchron raised $75 million in a funding round led by ARCH Venture Partners. In addition to Bezos Expeditions, Bill Gates' investment firm also took part in the round. Last year it was reported that Synchron was testing a technology (The Synchron Switch) that would allow people with no or very limited physical mobility to operate technology such as cursors or smart devices using their mind.\n\n9. Arrived Homes\n\nIn a budget as little as $100, you can own a property and then rent it out. That's the promise and business model of Arrived Homes, a fractional real estate platform company which raised about $160 million in funding and debt financing, including two infusions from Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions.\n\nLast year, Arrived Homes launched the Arrived Single Family Residential Fund which would allow investors to invest on their own schedule without having to wait for individual properties to launch.\n\n8. NotCO\n\nNotCo is a Chilean food technology company that uses algorithms and AI to find out the best combinations of plants to create alternatives to animal-based foods.\n\nIn 2022, NotCo raised another $70 million in fresh funding, led by Princeville Capital. Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions, which had already invested in the firm, again took part in the new funding round, along with Tiger Global, L Catterton, Kaszek Ventures and MercadoLibre CEO Marcos Galperin.\n\n7. Cloud Paper\n\nCloud Paper is one of the most unique names in the list of companies Jeff Bezos has been investing in. Cloud Paper aims to impact the traditional paper industry. Cloud Paper makes bamboo-based tree-free toilet paper which it sources from \"responsibly-managed forests.\"\n\nIn 2022, Cloud Paper raised $5 million in a funding round in which Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions took part. Cloud Paper planned to launch commercial-size toilet paper and touchless dispensers. While major companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) always steal the show because of their clout and size in the investing space, wise investors are always on the lookout to find smaller, promising companies like Cloud Paper to invest in.\n\n6. Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN)\n\nCalifornia-based EV company Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) ranks 6th in our list of the top Jeff Bezos investments in 2024. According to some reports Amazon owns about 10% to 15% stake in Rivian.\n\nIn 2019, Amazon signed a deal with Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) to have at least 100,000 electric delivery vans for itself on the road by 2030.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) during this period was Daniel Sundheim's D1 Capital Partners which owns a $327 million stake in Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN).\n\nIn addition to Rivian, hedge funds are also investing heavily in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQAMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHere is what Baron Global Advantage Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc., a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer, continued their volatile trading, and after declining during the first half of 2023, rose 45.7% during the third quarter. Rivian’s unit economics are improving as a result of several factors: i) the company’s production rate is increasing, which enables it to better absorb fixed costs; ii) Rivian is ramping-up the usage of more price effective technologies, such as LFP batteries and its in-house developed motor, Enduro; and iii) the company is benefiting from renegotiated supplier agreements, as its scale and purchasing power have significantly increased over the last few years. Management expects continued progress in profitability ahead as Rivian further scales production. We remain shareholders and believe that the release of Rivian’s new smaller SUV dubbed R2, which is planned for early 2024, would enable the company to compete in the higher volume SUV segment, and significantly expand its addressable market. On the liquidity front, we expect the company to raise additional funds to support its longer-term business plans.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jeff Bezos Investments in 2024: 5 Companies Bezos Is Investing In.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 High-Growth Canadian Dividend Stocks To Invest In 14 Money Making Stocks To Invest In 13 Cash-Rich Small Cap Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Could Help Make You Rich in 2024",
        "content": "As the company supplying 80% of the necessary training chips, Nvidia was arguably the biggest winner in 2023's artificial intelligence (AI) boom. That said, it makes sense for investors to diversify their holdings to target different sides of the long-term opportunity. Let's look at why Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) could also have a place in your portfolio in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nWith a market cap of $1.79 trillion, Alphabet is already the fourth-largest company in the world, and it will take a lot of momentum to power continued expansion. But AI may be able to do the trick. The tech giant is heavily incorporating AI infrastructure into its cloud-computing platform, which could generate much-needed diversification and long-term growth.\n\nAmong AI companies, Nvidia is particularly successful because it targets the \"picks and shovels\" side of the opportunity, minimizing competition while maximizing the total addressable market for its products. Google is developing a similar strategy (albeit higher on the value chain) by turning Google Cloud into a one-stop shop for all its enterprise clients' data-management and AI training needs. And while Google isn't the only cloud-service provider employing this strategy, it has some key advantages.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to CEO Sundar Pichai, 70% of generative AI start-up unicorns use Google's infrastructure to train and run their models. This is a big vote of confidence in the platform's quality and price point. And Google plans to build on this advantage with proprietary AI chips (called tensor processing units), which can bring down costs through vertical integration and reduce the company's reliance on third-party suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nAlphabet's low valuation is icing on the cake for investors. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 22, the stock is significantly cheaper than the NASDAQ 100's estimate of 29.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nFollowing the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, Meta's share price has been on a tear, jumping a substantial 174% in the last 12 months alone. Investors are optimistic about the company's decision to pivot away from metaverse development to focus more on generative AI, which could optimize its advertising and improve its consumer-facing platforms.\n\nAt first glance, Meta has some clear advantages in its AI efforts. The social media giant's business model has always involved gathering and monetizing huge amounts of data. And generative AI opens another avenue for this strategy through large language models (LLMs), which are algorithms designed to create content out of trained datasets.\n\nMeta is also adding conversational AI experiences across its popular apps, introducing features ranging from more responsive image editing on Instagram to conversational chatbots with distinct personalities on WhatsApp. These efforts probably won't immediately impact Meta's operational performance, but they could help maintain its platforms' user engagement and generate valuable customer data.\n\nOn the operational side, Meta is bouncing back from the challenges it faced in 2022. Third-quarter (2023) revenue jumped by 23% year over year to $34.15 billion, while net income jumped 164% to $11.58 billion, helped by aggressive cost cutting and layoffs. And with a forward P/E of just 22, it isn't too late for investors to bet on the company's long-term potential.\n\nAn increasingly competitive landscape\n\nIn 2024 and beyond, investors should expect the AI landscape to become increasingly competitive, especially on the software side of the market. With that in mind, it makes sense to bet on companies with potential economic moats. Alphabet and Meta Platforms fit the bill because of their treasure troves of user data, which can be used to train and refine LLMs. Both companies look poised for market-beating growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will list the 30 most overweight and obese cities in the world. If you want to skip our discussion on obesity, its risks and causes, and the weight loss industry, skip ahead to the 10 Most Overweight and Obese Cities in the World.\n\nChanges in lifestyle in recent history have resulted in an increase in obesity prevalence in the world. A sedentary lifestyle coupled with the consumption of processed food has made it one of the major issues in the world. The United States is also one of the most overweight and obese countries. Recentobesity statistics show that nearly one-third of adults in the United States are overweight, and over 40% are considered to be obese. Twelve of the 30 cities in our list of most overweight and obese cities in the world belong to the United States. A US city is also a part of our top five.\n\nBefore addressingits impact on health, we must ask what is obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an obese person as someone who has a body mass index (BMI) of over 25. A BMI is a person's weight in kilograms or pounds, divided by their height in meters square. A person who has a higher than 25 BMI is likely to have excessive fat accumulation, which presents several health risks associated with obesity. Overall, it has a negative effect on the lifestyle and life expectancy. Obese people are at a higher risk of developing Chronic diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and stroke. Other medical conditions such as osteoarthritis, digestive problems, and sleep apnea can also be caused by obesity. In addition, it can also cause mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.\n\nThe evergrowing obesity and the desire to lose weight have paved the way for a weight loss industry that has grown exponentially in a short period. However, the lucrative nature of the market has also given rise to some diet fads which promise to reduce significant amounts of weight in a reduced time. The obsession with losing weight and looking in a certain desirable way has also resulted in eating disorders, such as anorexia, where people put themselves into physical harm.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the rise of weight loss supplements and so-called anti-obesity medications has prompted governments throughout the world to take severe actions. Ozempic, a drug by Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), is primarily used to manage type 2 diabetes as it helps to lower blood sugar. However, more recently, it is increasingly being used for weight loss, for which it is not officially approved. A TikTok trend made the drug so popular that people with diabetes started fearing its shortage. However, TikTok responded with a crackdown on all weight-loss drugs.\n\nThe trend even led to the creation of a black market for Ozempic, which was met with a crackdown by countries such as the United Kingdom. Back in 2019, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s popular social media platform, Instagram, took measures to cut down on posts that promote weight-loss products. In general, both Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Facebook and Instagram have a more restrictive policy towards the promotion of weight-loss products, especially those that promise a quick fix. On a more positive note, some diet companies are working to promote sustainable nutrition programs and supplements to facilitate weight loss. One of these is Medifast, Inc. (NYSE:MED), one of the largest diet companies. More recently, the company saw a decline in share price and EPS, due to the changes in microeconomic and competitive environments. However, Medifast, Inc. (NYSE:MED) has responded by reassessing the drivers for long-term growth. The company is now on an aggressive path to make meaningful investments and seek growth in new environments. In its Q2 2023 earnings call, Medifast, Inc. (NYSE:MED) announced the following:\n\n\"We are also moving forward with some exciting new initiatives, which we expect will be drivers for future performance, focused on monetizing multiple healthy habits.\"\n\nWhile Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO)'s Ozempic is being used off-label for weight loss, the company is focused on selling legitimate weight loss drugs that are proving to be beneficial. Its weight loss treatment drug Wegovy has positive trial data and an ever-increasing demand. The drug is soaring in demand which enabled the Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) to upgrade its operating profit expectations last year. Another big-name pharmaceutical, Eli Lily and Company (NYSE:LLY) is in phase three trials of Orforglipron, a weight-loss oral drug that is delivering promising results. The drug has a strong efficacy profile which is unsurprising since Eli Lily and Company (NYSE:LLY) is one of the biggest diet/weight-loss companies in the world. Here is what Carillon Clarivest Capital Appreciation Fund said about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), the drug manufacturer, announced the completion of previously disclosed acquisitions of Versanis Bio and Sigilon Therapeutics, as it continues to expand its pipeline for diabetes and weight-loss medications. Shares gained after its sales and earnings per share exceeded estimates and a competitor’s study on the beneficial results of these treatments reported positive data\"\n\nThe imbalance between the intake and expenditure of calories is among the top causes of obesity. As such, fast food consumption results in excessive consumption of calories. The global average intake of calories has increased from 2,200 kcal per day to 2,800 from the 1960s to 2013. The increase in this calorie intake can be attributed to the popularity of carbonated beverage and fast food brands. According to a study by George Washington University, the United Statesbears a medical cost ranging from $147 billion to $210 billion annually because of obesity. Loss of productivity because of obesity-related conditions further costs the country anywhere between $3.38 billion to $6.38 billion each year. Given that obesity causes a huge financial strain on the country's economy, more should be done to regulate brands that sell processed food.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 30 most overweight and obese cities in the world.  30 Most Overweight and Obese Cities in the World\n\nPhoto by Evgeny Nelmin on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of the 30 most overweight and obese cities in the world, we relied on Google Trends 2023 data. Comprehensive data on worldwide cities regarding obesity was not available at the time of writing this article. First, we selected 25 countries featured on our list of most obese countries. Then, for each country, we looked at city-wise Google Trends on the following topic: weight loss. The premise here is that the higher the popularity of this topic, the more prevalent obesity will be. Google Trends scores each region or city out of 100 regarding the popularity of the topic. We noted down the Google Trends score of the cities for which the data was available and ranked them based on this. As a tie-breaker, we used the ranking of their countries in our list of the most obese countries.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "4 Marvelous Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the Wake of the Nasdaq Bear Market Dip",
        "content": "In 2023, Wall Street enjoyed a truly stellar year. Although the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, it was the 43% gain by the growth-stock-driven Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) that stole the spotlight.\n\nYet in spite of this sizable bounce from the 2022 bear market lows, the high-flying Nasdaq Composite remains more than 7% below its all-time high, which was set in November 2021. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile a decline in the growth-stock-fueled Nasdaq Composite over the past 26 months may not be what short-term traders expected, it's music to the ears of long-term-minded investors. Even though we can't pinpoint ahead of time when stock market corrections will begin, history has shown that every downturn in the major indexes (including the Nasdaq) will be eventually (key word!) wiped away by a bull market rally.\n\nWhat follows are four marvelous growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip.\n\nMastercard\n\nThe first exceptional growth stock that's begging to be bought with the Nasdaq Composite still notably below its record high is payment facilitator Mastercard(NYSE: MA).\n\nThe top concern for financial stocks like Mastercard is that they're cyclical. In other words, they ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nWith a couple of money-focused metrics and predictive tools forecasting a U.S. recession in 2024, there's the genuine possibility that consumer and enterprise spending could taper as the year wears on. As a predominantly fee-based business, Mastercard would struggle during a recession.\n\nOn the other hand, recessions don't last very long. Only three of the one dozen recessions since 1945 have lasted at least a year, with none surpassing 18 months. Since expansions typically last multiple years, companies like Mastercard are often thriving.\n\nTo add to the above, Mastercard's management team has made the wise decision to steer clear of the lending space. Though the company would probably excel as a lender, economic downturns would expose it to loan losses that require capital to be set aside. Not having to set aside capital is a competitive advantage that supports the company's 40%-plus profit margin and allows it to bounce back from recessions faster than most lending institutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMastercard's opportunity in largely underbanked emerging markets, coupled with its established position in developed markets, should double its earnings per share over a five-year stretch (2022-2027). With an annualized estimated earnings growth rate of nearly 21% over the coming five years, Mastercard stock remains cheap.\n\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical\n\nA second marvelous growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market decline is biotech stock BioMarin Pharmaceutical(NASDAQ: BMRN).\n\nThe biggest argument skeptics can bring to the table for BioMarin is that shares are currently pricey. On a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, investors are paying north of 120 times earnings. While this does represent quite the premium to the broader market, a projected 43% annualized earnings growth rate over the next five years should more than make up for these concerns.\n\nBioMarin's competitive edge is that it focuses on developing therapies for patients with ultrarare diseases. Though there are monetary risks involved with developing drugs targeting a small pool of patients, there are also ample rewards for approved therapies. Health insurers rarely push back on high list prices for rare-disease drugs, and there's usually little competition.\n\nThough BioMarin has more than a half-dozen approved therapies, its dwarfism drug Voxzogo is making the biggest impact. Voxzogo sales more than tripled through the first nine months of 2023, when compared to the prior-year period, and have the potential to eventually top $1 billion in peak annual sales. New drug launches, coupled with organic growth from existing therapies, have put BioMarin on a path to double its full-year sales to north of $4 billion by 2027.\n\nLastly, don't forget that healthcare stocks are incredibly defensive. No matter what the U.S. economy throws consumers' way, patients will still need prescription medicine. This suggests that BioMarin Pharmaceutical's operating cash flow can remain strong and predictable in any economic climate. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEtsy\n\nThe third amazing growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not purchasing in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market swoon is burgeoning e-commerce company Etsy(NASDAQ: ETSY).\n\nSimilar to Mastercard, the prevailing headwind for Etsy would be a recession taking shape in 2024. Etsy's platform is driven by consumer purchases, and it's no secret that consumers spend less when economic growth weakens. But as I pointed out with Mastercard, periods of economic expansion handily outlast recessions. For long-term investors, this is a numbers game that's very much in their favor.\n\nWhat makes Etsy's operating model \"tick\" is the company's merchant base. Whereas e-commerce giants like Amazon dominate from a volume perspective, there's not a big attempt to personalize the buying process. Etsy's entire merchant base is comprised of sole proprietors and small businesses that'll customize orders. No e-commerce platform can, at scale, match the personalization that Etsy's merchant base brings to the table.\n\nAt the same time, Etsy has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on habitual buyers. A \"habitual buyer\" is someone who makes six or more purchases over the TTM period, with the aggregate of these purchases totaling at least $200. Over the four-year period between Sept. 30, 2019 and Sept. 30, 2023 (i.e., beginning prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), the number of habitual buyers tripled to 7.1 million. Habitual-buyer growth is what gives Etsy phenomenal fee-pricing power with merchants and has helped fuel a modest increase in its take rate.\n\nAlthough Etsy's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26 might seem a bit lofty, considering the uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy, its consensus annualized earnings growth rate of 16% over the next five years implies it's still inexpensive.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nA fourth marvelous growth stock you'll regret not buying in the wake of the Nasdaq bear market dip is social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nNot to sound like a broken record, but the fear of a recession could be the biggest monkey on Meta's proverbial back in the new year. Meta generates in excess of 98% of its revenue from advertising, and advertisers are known to pare back their spending at the first signs of trouble. It's one of the reasons why Meta struggled mightily in 2022.\n\nThankfully, Meta Platforms has easily identifiable catalysts and moats working in its favor. For example, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger collectively helped the company attract close to 4 billion monthly active users during the September-ended quarter. Businesses are keenly aware that no social media platform offers them access to more eyeballs than Meta's top-tier social media real estate. As a result, the company typically enjoys exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nMeta's operating cash flow and balance sheet are additional reasons this stock is a surefire buy. Despite widening losses from virtual and augmented reality segment Reality Labs, Meta still generated $51.7 billion in net cash from its operations through the first nine months of 2023. When coupled with its greater-than $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, it's clear the company has the luxury of taking risks on next-big-thing investment trends.\n\nThe final reason to confidently buy Meta Platforms is its valuation. Even after quadrupling from its bear market lows in 2022, Meta stock remains historically cheap. Shares can currently be purchased for about 12X forward-year cash flow, which represents a 22% discount to the average cash flow multiple Meta has traded at over the previous five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Sell in January Before They Crash and Burn",
        "content": "The metaverse has been a hot topic for several years now. Ever since Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerburg renamed his company to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), investors have taken this concept seriously. We’ve seen Super Bowl ads and all sorts of other mainstream attention for the metaverse concept. Unfortunately for some, this has led to this list of metaverse stocks to sell.\n\nAnd yet, Meta’s own Horizon Worlds appears to be a money-burning flop, at least to date. Whether it be issues with the technical hardware, a lack of glamorous metaverse applications, or simply consumer disinterest in the concept, virtual worlds haven’t taken off as expected.\n\nThat’s particularly bad news for these three metaverse stocks in particular. While it is too early to write off the concept entirely, investors should be extremely wary about these three metaverse stocks today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has long been a story stock. While the company’s profits and fundamentals have been mediocre recently, traders have gravitated to AMD stock for a variety of narratives.\n\nFor a while, AMD purported to have an upside based on crypto mining. Lately, many folks are excited about AMD due to AI possibilities, even though AMD’s program there appears to be far behind that of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAMD also has gotten caught up in the hype cycle around the metaverse. In theory, AMD could make a lot of money selling graphics chips if the metaverse takes off and the big tech companies need far more computing power to operate all these virtual world applications.\n\nIn practice, however, there’s little evidence of broad metaverse adoption and scant reason to think it will improve AMD’s operating results shortly.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSocial media company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is a fascinating enterprise. Its focus on younger users and more image-driven messaging seemed like it could make for a significant player in its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, between operational issues and heavy competition, Snap has failed to deliver on that promise. The company is only marginally profitable, with a forward P/E ratio of more than 200. Meanwhile, revenue growth has stalled almost entirely, with the company on pace for less than 1% revenue growth for the full year 2023.\n\nSnapchat is a leading innovator in virtual and augmented reality applications. If these take off, perhaps that will finally be the thing that helps Snap reach more mainstream adoption. However, CEO Evan Spiegel has been skeptical of Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse, and it seems virtual worlds won’t provide salvation for SNAP’s stock price anytime soon.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is a leading gaming ecosystem. With its low-definition graphics and focus on user-generated content, Roblox has achieved a high adoption rate among younger users.\n\nRoblox has a large virtual world, and it is one of the few that already has meaningful revenue generation with some mainstream brands and companies advertising there. This makes it seem like a logical thought that Roblox will become a triumphant player in the metaverse.\n\nHowever, Roblox’s user base remains overwhelmingly young. This has led to issues, such as inappropriate content allegedly being shown to minors. In addition, it can be hard to build a mainstream and highly profitable platform primarily aimed at people under 18.\n\nRoblox has grown revenues quickly. But there is little sign of operating scale. The company lost more than $1 billion last year. Analysts expect Roblox to remain loss-making through at least 2028. For now, Roblox’s virtual worlds aren’t turning into real-world profits or cash flow. This makes it one of those metaverse stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the stock market, three giants are steadily on the path to attaining a trillion-dollar market cap by 2028. This has led to this list of upcoming trillion-dollar companies. The first one, the powerhouse behind social media, is leveraging its AI investments to fuel unprecedented growth. The company is at the edge of tech advancements, from virtual assistants to generative AI.\n\nThe second one is a relentless pursuit of semiconductor advancements. This can be observed in considerable revenue growth. The strategic deployment of cutting-edge technologies like 3-nanometer nodes and a diversified portfolio position TSMC as a linchpin in the semiconductor industry.\n\nOn a different front, the third one continues its ascent through diverse business activities, with insurance underwriting and strategic investments contributing vitally. The conglomerate’s financial prowess, evident in considerable earnings and investment income growth, cements its standing as an enduring force in the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRead more to learn the intricacies of the first’s AI dominance, the second’s semiconductor supremacy, and the third’s diversified growth strategies. The article explores the factors propelling them towards trillion-dollar market valuations.\n\nMeta (META) Threads app logo seen on screen.

The company is projected to make heavy investments in AI, making it Meta’s most considerable investment area in 2024 regarding engineering and computing resources.\n\nAdditionally, the deployment of Meta AI, a new assistant accessible across messaging experiences and smart glasses, is a vital AI application. The assistant allows users to ask questions, access real-time information, and generate photorealistic images. Furthermore, integrating the AI Studio platform further amplifies Meta’s AI efforts, enabling users to create and interact with various AIs for assistance and entertainment. Additionally, the rollout of Emu, an image creation model, showcases Meta’s focus on AI-driven content creation. This makes it one of those trillion-dollar companies in the making.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI may continue to play an increasingly important role. It plays a pivotal role in Meta’s product roadmap. Llama 2, mentioned as a leading open-source model, signifies Meta’s contributions to the broader AI community. The sophisticated recommendation AI systems power feeds, reels, ads, and integrity systems. While less hyped than generative AI, these recommendation systems improve user engagement, as evidenced by a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram in the current year alone (Q3 2023).\n\nAdditionally, business-wise, AI tools for advertisers, such as Advantage+ shopping campaigns, have reached a $10 billion run rate. This reflects the effectiveness of Meta’s AI applications and positions the company as a valuable partner for advertisers looking to optimize their campaigns.\n\nOverall, Meta’s focus on AI, like virtual assistants, content creation, recommendation systems, and ad tools, forms a solid foundation for rapid growth.\n\nTSMC (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe fundamental factor that supports TSMC’s (NYSE:TSM) market value growth is its sequential revenue growth. For instance, in Q3 2023, TSMC experienced a noteworthy sequential revenue increase, demonstrating the company’s adaptability in a dynamic semiconductor market. The growth of 13.7% in NT dollars and 10.2% in US dollars reflects the successful execution of TSMC’s business strategies and the effectiveness of its production (fab) capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, this considerable revenue growth can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, there is a solid ramp-up of TSMC’s industry-leading 3-nanometer tech. The successful deployment of advanced semiconductor processes reflects TSMC’s edge and ability to stay considerably ahead of the competition.\n\nFurthermore, the higher demand for 5-nanometer tech drove revenue growth. Thus, TSMC can cater to the market’s appetite for advanced tech, which further solidifies the company’s position as a preferred foundry partner for semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIn detail, the revenue distribution by technology provides valuable insights into TSMC’s portfolio and market demand. Specifically, the 3-nanometer process contributed 6% of wafer revenue in Q3, suggesting the rapid adoption of TSMC’s latest and most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node. Also, the 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer techs account for 37% and 16% of wafer revenue, indicating the broad spectrum of technologies TSMC offers. Hence, this diversified portfolio positions TSMC as a versatile partner for clients with varying requirements. All in all, TSMC could be one of those upcoming trillion-dollar companies.\n\nFinally, the company’s dominance in advanced tech, defined as 7-nanometer and below, constituting 59% of wafer revenue, signifies TSMC’s focus on pushing the edge in semiconductor advancement. These advanced nodes have become increasingly critical for various applications. As a result, TSMC has leadership in this space. This is a vital growth driver for the company’s market value.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffet Stocks: a picture of warren buffett smiling.\n\nSource: Kent Sievers / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) grows from diverse activities, but its insurance underwriting is a vital booster to the company’s bottom line.\n\nFor instance, in Q3 2023, it generated earnings of $2.4 billion, an edgy improvement compared to a loss of $1.1 billion in 2022. Similarly, for Q1-Q3 2023, underwriting earnings amounted to $4.6 billion, a vital boost from the $190 million in 2022 (Q1-Q3).\n\nOn the other hand, Berkshire Hathaway’s investment income is another vital fundamental for its performance. For instance, in Q3 2023, investment income increased by $1.1 billion compared to Q3 2022, and in Q1-Q3 2023, investment income growth amounted to $2.3 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the primary driver of this growth was higher short-term rates. These rates favorably impacted the yields on cash (marketable securities), and the weighted average yield on investments in fixed-maturity securities increased from 2.2% in Q3 2022 to 2.7% in Q3 2023. Also, dividend income was boosted by $19 million (0.3% year-over-year) in Q1–Q3 2023. This put it in the trillion-dollar companies category.\n\nMoreover, realized gains and losses on investments are critical in Berkshire Hathaway’s bottom line. In Q3 2023, the company realized gains of $1.6 billion, highlighting gains in equity securities sales and changes in equity securities market prices. This marked a solid improvement from the realized losses of $6.3 billion in 2022. Lastly, for Q1-Q3 2023, realized gains boosted to $5.4 billion, compared to realized losses of $1.3 billion in 2022 (Q1-Q3). Therefore, Berkshire Hathaway’s investments across multiple industries may continue to deliver diversified value growth.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in META.

        "content": "With the world become increasingly interconnected in the digital realm, forward-looking investors ought to check out metaverse stocks. Unless you’re deliberately living the lifestyle of an off-grid luddite, you’ve heard about the metaverse. But what exactly is it?\n\nTrying to find explanations for somewhat esoteric concepts that don’t involve overly complex jargon – laced with a pompous aura – can be incredibly difficult. Fortunately, Builtin.com provides a clear, no-nonsense definition:\n\n“The metaverse is a network of shared, immersive virtual worlds where people can connect with friends, create and play games, work and shop. You can think of the metaverse as a cyberspace, or an evolved, three-dimensional internet where logging in isn’t necessary. It may also incorporate elements of virtual and augmented reality.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven better, metaverse stocks are very much a thing. According to data compiled by Statista, the metaverse market may reach a valuation of $74.4 billion by year’s end. Further, the segment could hit $507.8 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.73%. Even if you’re not a tech wizard, you can understand a CAGR of nearly 38%.\n\nOn that note, below are enticing metaverse stocks to add to your portfolio.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce exclusively known as a social media network, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has arguably become synonymous with metaverse stocks. Broadly speaking, Meta has made heavy investments in metaverse research and development. As well, it made key acquisitions of VR and AR companies, helping to set the stage for its brand pivot as a powerhouse in the burgeoning ecosystem.\n\nRegarding specific company initiatives, Meta has developed a range of VR headsets called Meta Quest. That’s the primary gateway to the company’s metaverse experiences, which includes Horizon Worlds. Meta’s flagship VR social platform, Horizon Worlds allows users to create and explore virtual worlds, socialize, and enjoy entertainment content. Further, Meta has the clear advantage of leveraging its Facebook network to help advertise and integrate its new ventures.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor investors, you just can’t keep META stock down for too long. After suffering a terrible decline in value in 2022, it stormed higher last year. Indeed, shares gained 177% of equity value in the past 52 weeks. Unsurprisingly, it’s a strong buy with an average price target sitting just under $400.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nA video game software development company, Unity Software (NYSE:U) represents an intriguing but risky idea among metaverse stocks. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the company will target layoffs that will impact approximately 25% of its workforce. Nominally, that translates to 1,800 jobs. While the cost-reduction implications might help U stock, the cuts also suggest that circumstances haven’t gone to plan.\n\nStill, Unity may attract contrarian interest as one of the metaverse stocks to buy because of the underlying game engine. Critically, the company’s game development engine may be the most widely used in the world. Either way, developers leverage the powerful platform to create three-dimensional worlds, characters and interactive experiences. Logically, this dynamic provides a foundation for myriad metaverse projects.\n\nNevertheless, the issue with Unity centers on the financials. Sure, the company remains a growth machine, featuring an expansion rate of 23.6% during the past three years. However, investors also want to see a pathway to profitability. Overall, analysts are hopeful, with the high-side target landing at $50.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Meta Platforms may be synonymous with metaverse stocks, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) may actually own the world’s biggest digital universe. Per a CNET article, Roblox represents a vast marketplace with ever-evolving experiences. Further, with the advent of generative artificial intelligence, the company is only becoming more relevant in this burgeoning space. Therefore, anyone interested in the metaverse economy ought to consider RBLX.\n\nPer CNET, Roblox released two new AI tools in early 2023 which have bolstered utility in the creator-focused Roblox Studio. As a coding tool, users can now use conversational AI to generate code on the fly. In this way, users can create digital environments just by describing them. I imagine such flexibility and utility can get addictive, meaning that RBLX is one of the metaverse stocks to watch.\n\nAs with anything, Roblox comes with risks. In particular, the company is off to a rough start, losing 10% since the beginning of January. Also, while it’s a growth machine, it lacks in financial stability. Still, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $44.05 price target, implying nearly 14% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Last year was booming for artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI became mainstream, and enterprises started making investments in the space. If you are wondering whether it is too late to invest, we are still in the early stages of adoption. This article discusses some AI stocks to buy that are central to this revolution.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, one-third of organizations already use AI in at least one of their business functions. Additionally, 40% plan to increase spending in this area. Already, leading companies are leveraging traditional and generative AI capabilities to drive productivity. These organizations attributed 20% of 2022 EBIT to using AI in business functions.\n\nGenerative AI has a lot of potential. According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) research, it could grow GDP by 7% annually in the next 10 years. The technology will automate tasks, streamline business workflows and enhance business applications.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToday, generative AI is applicable in business applications, drug development, software development and many more fields. The AI-fueled bull market will step up into high gear in 2024. These stocks to buy are leading the charge and are an integral part of the AI ecosystem.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nSurprisingly, one of the oldest technology companies is among the stocks that will benefit from AI. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been innovating in artificial intelligence for decades. Now, it’s bound to reap the rewards of its investments.\n\nThrough Watsonx, its AI and data platform, the company provides open-source models and IBM-curated and trained foundation models. What’s more, it offers a data store for gathering, training and cleansing data and an AI governance toolkit. All these capabilities enable clients to build and deploy specialized AI features across their enterprise.\n\nIBM has also embedded AI into its broad-based software portfolio. For instance, Watson Code Assistant delivers productivity gains for ITOps and DevOps teams. Furthermore, the company has integrated Watson technology with partners like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), Ernst & Young, Qualtrics and Sirion Labs.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, the consulting business is benefiting as organizations deploy more AI capabilities. IBM consultants are helping its customers deploy various generative AI solutions. IBM Consulting will be integral in scaling AI platforms and features in enterprises.\n\nNotably, the consulting segment has had four quarters of double-digit signing growth. As a result, the book-to-bill ratio has grown to 1.16. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is bullish and expects IBM’s consulting business to add $1 billion in revenues from AI. Due to the growing AI revenues, it remains one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

As has been evident for a few months, the company is an AI leader. While Apple has been quiet on AI, Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI and launched several products.\n\nThe Redmond-based software giant is among the best stocks to buy since it will benefit from increased enterprise spending on AI. According to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), CIOs expect a 3.3% IT budget growth in 2024. Of course, generative AI will be a key priority area due to huge productivity gains.\n\nMicrosoft will capture a significant share of this spending in various ways. First, Microsoft Azure has the best AI infrastructure for training and inference. Its services are available in over 60 data center regions worldwide. No other cloud provider covers more areas.\n\nAzure AI offers the best AI models from OpenAI and open-source models from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Hugging Face and others. Today, customers are using these models to develop their own AI applications. Due to the breadth of services and wide geographic reach, over 18,000 customers use Azure OpenAI services.\n\nAnother key area of Microsoft’s AI services has been improving productivity through copilots. The first service, GitHub Copilot, has become popular among developers since it increases productivity by over 55%. Microsoft 365 copilot is also seeing widespread adoption and could generate annual revenues of $10 billion by 2026.\n\nThe opportunities mentioned above elevate Microsoft as one of the best AI stocks to buy. As generative AI adoption grows, Microsoft will expand its AI customer base. Lastly, TipRanks analysts are bullish, with an average price target of $429, a possible 10% increase.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs cloud service providers increase data center spending in 2024 to meet AI/ML workloads needs, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) will benefit. The networking company is a key supplier to all major cloud service providers. Microsoft and Meta Platforms are large customers, accounting for about 42% of revenues in fiscal year 2022.\n\nTypically, AI workloads are compute and data-intensive, requiring computations distributed across thousands of GPUs. Therefore, the interconnect must deliver reliable performance, speed, scalability and interoperability. That is where Arista’s IP/Ethernet switches for GPU and Storage interconnects come into play.\n\nThe company provides the best ethernet solutions for AI networks. Its data center switches offer the best performance and low latency. Besides, Arista’s Universal Leaf and Spine design supports the interconnection of thousands of GPUs in large-scale AI applications.\n\nToday, Arista Networks is one of the top networking stocks to buy since its products are critical in building AI data centers. Its 7800R3 AI spine and 7060 AI leaf products are integral in optimizing networks and maximizing modern AI applications. Besides, Arista EOS, its Linux-based network operation system, provides the tools to achieve a high-bandwidth, low-latency, scalable, lossless and multi-tenant network.\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the company since its products are essential in building data centers to handle AI workloads. Their consensus estimates predict 33% revenue growth for 2023 and the momentum to continue in 2024. As major cloud service providers invest in more data centers to enhance their AI services, it’s one of the stocks that will get an AI boost.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Social media stocks have recovered nicely from the market downturn in 2022. The Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL), which is comprised of 43 stocks, has gained 9.6% in the last 12 months. Since bottoming in November 2022, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) is up 50%. It’s a big reversal for the social media space, which was one of the hardest hit when investors sold out of equities in 2022. The large sell-off happened as the U.S. Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates to dampen a 40-year high inflation rate.\n\nThe rebound is due to several factors that include an expected decline in interest rates, a resurgence in online ad spending and the continued growth and popularity of social media sites, with consumers young and old spending more time and money on the platforms. Here are three social media stocks capitalizing on digital connections.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nShares of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) have been on a run ever since the social media company reported its third-quarter financial results at the end of October. PINS stock jumped 18% the day after the Q3 print, and the share price is now up nearly 30% in the last six months. Over the past year, the company’s stock has gained 36%. It’s a big reversal from 2022 when Pinterest shareholders had to watch as the stock cratered in what was a brutal bear market, especially for technology-related companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe dark days of 2022 now seem like a distant memory after Pinterest reported Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of 28 cents, which topped Wall Street estimates of 20 cents. Revenue for the three months ending Sept. 30 rose 11% from a year earlier to $763.2 million, which was ahead of the $743.5 million expected among analysts. The company said that the number of global monthly active users on its platform rose 8% during Q3 from a year earlier to 482 million. Average revenue per user was $1.61, beating projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen.

The company continues to derive the majority of its revenue from advertising on those platforms and plows most of its profits from social media into new ventures such as AI and the Metaverse.\n\nThanks to its profitability and diversification, Meta Platforms stock continues to power ahead, having gained 170% in the last 12 months. META stock has also recovered from a big sell-off during the 2022 bear market.\n\nWhile AI continues to draw attention to the stock, much of the rebound can be attributed to a recovery in online advertising on the company’s social media sites. Meta Platforms’ online ad sales in Q3 of last year grew by $27.71 billion, pushing overall revenue to the fastest rate of growth in two years.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify’s (NYSE:SPOT) stock has been red hot since the music streaming service announced in December that it’s laying off 17% of its workforce in an effort to reduce costs. SPOT stock has risen 115% in the last 12 months, including a 4.6% gain so far just in the first few days of 2024. Company executives have made cost containment a central focus coming out of the pandemic, and it is paying off. Spotify reported a $69 million profit in Q3 of last year due largely to lower spending.\n\nThe latest headcount reduction works out to 1,500 jobs worldwide. It comes after Spotify raised prices for its monthly subscriptions earlier in 2023, another move that drew praise from analysts and investors. Spotify is also continuing to expand into podcasts and audiobooks, which complement its focus on music. The company previously cut 8% of its workforce in the first half of 2023. SPOT stock has soared 177% from the all-time low it hit in November 2022.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "My 2 Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks didn't get that moniker for no reason. It refers to a group of tech companies that have historically delivered market-crushing returns and could continue to do so. No doubt, every single one of them is worth some consideration, and in my view, most have a place in most investors' portfolios.\n\nHowever, two of these corporations, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), are my favorites, although they are very close. Let's consider why these two tech juggernauts are excellent forever stocks.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple's market cap is inching closer to $3 trillion, and the company's biggest growth driver in the past 15 years, namely the iPhone, has lost traction. To be clear, the iPhone continues to generate tens of billions in sales every year for Apple and remains its largest category in terms of revenue. But it simply doesn't drive the same kind of top-line growth that it once did.\n\nMany investors are skeptical of Apple's future, but the company can still deliver market-beating returns. For one, Apple has a history of developing newer, better technological devices, often adding tweaks to existing gadgets. They won't all be as successful as the iPhone, but investors can expect more gems from the tech giant along those lines.\n\nSecond, Apple is increasingly relying on its services segment. The opportunities here are nearly limitless: Thanks to an installed base of more than 2 billion devices, Apple can offer a range of services, from video and audio streaming to healthcare and fintech. Nothing stops the company from adding new options, and that's precisely what it has historically done.\n\nApple's services business also generates much higher margins than the rest of its operations, so as it becomes a larger part of its revenue, it will work wonders for its bottom line. Third, Apple has a strong competitive advantage that stems from its brand name -- one of the most valuable in the world -- and switching costs. Those who join Apple's ecosystem of interconnected devices and services find it difficult to leave for fear of having to deal with such troublesome things as having to migrate valuable data.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple consistently ranks among the top companies in terms of customer loyalty for a reason. Last but not least, Apple pays a dividend. In the past 10 years, it has raised its payouts by 120%. Reinvesting dividends will help boost long-term returns for those who choose to do so. Apple may no longer offer the kinds of returns it did in the 2010s, but that's an incredibly high bar for any company.\n\nStill, the tech giant should remain a leader in its field for a long time and continue delivering above-average returns.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, has also had its detractors. Its advertising revenue dropped for some time due to economic pressure, and the company saw its profits squeezed by heavy investment in its Reality Labs segment. However, Meta Platforms turned the corner last year. The company decreased expenses while benefiting from a rebound in the advertising market.\n\nRevenue increased, profits jumped, and the stock performed exceptionally well in 2023. Here's what that tells us about Meta Platforms' prospects. While it is susceptible to the whims of the economy -- as are many successful corporations -- the company's business is strong enough to handle them. One of Meta Platforms' most important assets is that it boasts 3.96 billion monthly active users across its websites and apps.\n\nThat's about half of the human population that visits at least one of Meta's websites at least once a month and about 3.14 billion who do so daily. Furthermore, the company benefits from a competitive advantage as well, mainly from the network effect. Want to catch up and share pictures with friends and family? Going to a website that already has a large number of users, such as Instagram, is a great option. And the more people who join the platform, the more attractive it becomes.\n\nMeta has also been ramping up new monetization initiatives. The company's Reels (short-form videos across Facebook and Instagram designed to compete with TikTok) is soaring in popularity, while paid messaging on WhatsApp is also delivering excellent results. The company is also making a push in artificial intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms hasn't given up on its metaverse idea, although that likely won't yield any significant return on investment soon. Still, it is another potential long-term opportunity for the company. E-commerce is another obvious growth opportunity for Meta Platforms, given its large ecosystem. Meta should soon rejoin the trillion-dollar club, but that won't mark the end of the company's growth journey.\n\nThat story still has plenty of chapters left. Investors can buy the stock, sit back, and enjoy the ride.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw a significant share price rise of 27% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Meta Platforms’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms Worth?\n\nGood news, investors! Meta Platforms is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $501.66, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Meta Platforms’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Meta Platforms generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Meta Platforms' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 89%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since META is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on META for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy META. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META): Don’t Ignore the Election Year Tailwind",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has experienced remarkable bullish momentum, rising by an impressive 177% in the past year. Despite undergoing such a tremendous rally, I expect sustained positive sentiment, especially with 2024 being an election year. With an anticipated uptick in ad spending this year, Meta, a giant in the advertising space, stands to reap significant benefits. Coupled with my view that shares appear reasonably valued, my outlook on META remains bullish.\n\nAssessing Meta Platform’s Current Momentum\n\nWith Meta surging by more than 174% over the past year, the stock is undeniably enjoying unstoppable momentum. In my view, several factors are powering this momentum, but the benefits from the 2024 elections have not been priced in yet, leaving plenty of room for upside.\n\nIn particular, I would attribute the ongoing stock price rally to a mix of FOMO and improving margins following last year’s cost-cutting initiatives. However, the stock seems cheap relative to Meta’s future earnings growth estimates. But let’s look at one thing at a time.\n\nLooking back to October 2022, only a year and a half ago, the sentiment surrounding Meta stock was quite different. At the time, shares dipped below $90 as the company grappled with perceived instability. Mark Zuckerberg was then attempting to justify Meta’s Reality Labs segment, incurring over $10 billion in annual losses, as a reasonable investment. The company’s attention had shifted entirely to the elusive “Metaverse.” And yet, the Metaverse demos at the time looked worse than Wii Sports released in 2006.\n\nInvestors, myself included, disapproved of this direction. We had a robust platform of lucrative apps, and instead of focusing on monetization, cost efficiency, and returning capital to shareholders, Zuckerberg redirected the ship toward the unknown. Fortunately, Meta’s management swiftly responded to investors’ concerns, gradually becoming quieter on the Metaverse and starting to focus on implementing cost-cutting measures, including a 13% reduction in the workforce in late 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis caused a rapid shift from an ultra-bearish sentiment to an ultra-bullish one, leading to Meta’s swift rally. Such a sudden shift in sentiment likely left many investors behind. Thus, I believe the ongoing momentum continues to be propelled by FOMO.\n\nBut while some may argue that this FOMO may have led to the stock being overvalued, I think otherwise. In fact, shares remain attractively priced considering Meta’s future growth estimates – especially in the face of upcoming election-related spending. Let’s take a deeper look.\n\nIs Meta’s Current Valuation Aligned with Election-Boosted Growth Projections?\n\nThe impending U.S. elections should serve as a substantial tailwind for the advertising industry, with industry giants like Meta poised to capitalize significantly. To provide context, in the 2019-2020 election cycle, total political advertising spending reached a staggering $8.5 billion across all mediums, with political digital advertising witnessing a remarkable 4.6x increase from 2018 to 2020.\n\nResearch stemming from the previous election cycle underscores Facebook’s 12-fold cost-effectiveness compared to TV in less efficient geographical zones. Also, a February 2021 Wesleyan study revealed that over 10 times as many state legislative candidates opted to advertise on Facebook than on television, primarily attributing this choice to the cost-advantaged tradeoff.\n\nWith politicians increasingly convinced of the effectiveness of digital ad spend, the current election cycle is poised to lead to a substantial surge in political ad spending.\n\nReuters reports a projected 30% increase in political ad spending in the U.S. this year compared to the last presidential election in 2020, primarily driven by higher expenditures on digital platforms. While TV remains the dominant recipient of ad spending, digital platforms are expected to see the most significant growth in political ads, with revenues forecasted to surge by 156% from 2020 to $3.46 billion in 2024.\n\nWall Street analysts seem to be catching up to this reality. Last year, the market anticipated Meta to achieve revenues of approximately $137 billion in Fiscal 2024. This figure has since risen to nearly $151 billion, and given the ongoing trajectory of earnings estimate revisions, there is a strong likelihood that this figure will continue to ascend.\n\nIn the interim, consensus estimates suggest that Meta will post EPS of $17.43 next year. Notably, Wall Street estimates have historically been conservative, with Meta often exceeding expectations by a wide margin. Even if we adopt Wall Street’s estimate, though, Meta’s current valuation stands at a modest 21 times next year’s EPS.\n\nI believe that this forward P/E is cheap, given the company’s substantial market dominance, consistent double-digit growth, and management’s strategic focus on bolstering profits. Consequently, in spite of Meta’s considerable rally in recent quarters, the combination of relatively subdued forward estimates and a soft valuation should continue to support the ongoing positive momentum.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nRegarding Wall Street’s sentiment on the stock, Meta Platforms retains a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 36 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $397.31, the average META stock price target suggests 8.1% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell META stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Brad Erickson from RBC Capital, with an average return of 58.54% per rating and a 76% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nMeta Platforms’ crazy surge in the past year reflects its invincible momentum driven by factors like FOMO and improving margins. However, as the 2024 election year approaches, the anticipated uptick in political ad spending positions Meta for further gains.\n\nReflecting on Meta’s transformative journey from a Metaverse-centric focus to a profit-driven strategy, the current valuation also appears attractive. With a notable increase in political ad spending that only gradually appears priced in by Wall Street estimates, Meta’s ongoing positive momentum seems poised for sustained growth.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 worst states for dividend income investors. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Worst States for Dividend Income Investors.\n\nWhy Should Investors Consider Dividend Aristocrats?\n\nOn December 30, 2023, Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer at Roundhill Investments, appeared in aninterview on Yahoo Finance, where he discussed the possible investment opportunities in 2024. Mazza said 2023 has been significant for the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks which include Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others. While artificial intelligence has led the year as a primary catalyst, Mazza reckons 2024 to be divided for the big tech group. He highlighted that the bifurcation of the market may simply depend on rate cuts, when and if they are fully enforced.\n\nMazza said that the market has been performing well and has been out of the earning recessions rut, which again is a good sign for the money market.  Moreover, he added that slowing inflation rates and increasing earnings on the horizon is a testament to the expansion of earnings in the stock market. However, while 2024 holds a positive outlook, the primary concern for investors will be consumers. Rising credit card spending and consumer stress are common factors, which may be significant later in the year, or act as a game changer for the market.\n\nMazza thinks dividend aristocrats, or companies that have been consistent with their dividend growth for 20 to 25 years, will be the best place to for investors to position themselves. He further added that dividend kings and dividend monarchs will be significant to investors, especially early in 2024. He said that these companies tend to be extremely resilient against market forces and happen to report consistent and strong free cash flow. Mazza noted that the upcoming elections and the pressure on the Fed shape his less favorable view of the market for the second half of 2024. Therefore, until consumer behavior is unclear, it might be safer to stick to elite dividend payers.\n\nStory continues\n\nElite Dividend Payers in the Market\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the most notable companies known for their continuous dividend growth rates. Let's discuss some recent updates from these companies. You can also take a look at thetax-friendly states for high income in the United States.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is not only a favorite pick of dividend income investors, but it is also known for spearheading sustainability initiatives. On October 25, 2023, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)announced that all 500-mL sparkling beverages in Canada will be made with 100% recycled plastic. The initiative suggests that no sparkling 500-mL water bottle will be made from virgin plastic starting in 2024. The initiative is a huge step forward for the company's sustainability plans. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has implemented a cyclical system in place, which spreads across the recycling, cleaning, and sorting of plastic until it is transformed into flakes to produce new bottles. To support the initiative, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) also launched an advertising campaign called \"Recycle Me Again.\"\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is another top stock pick among dividend investors, as of January 16 the stock is offering a forward dividend yield of 2.50%. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was a part of 75 hedge fund portfolios at the close of the third quarter of 2023. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $5.73 billion, up from $5.35 billion in the previous quarter with 74 positions. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive. As of December 31, 2023, Ayrshire Capital Management is the largest shareholder in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and has a position worth $4.22 million. The stock covers 2.43% of the fund's portfolio.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is not only a dividend aristocrat, but it is also a dividend king. As of January 16, the stock has a forward dividend yield of 2.93%. The company's commitment to expand is a testament to its popularity in the industry. On January 8, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)signed an agreement to acquire Ambrx Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAM) for a staggering $2.0 billion. The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company is focused on designing next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Such will enhance the efficacy across multiple cancer indications such as the ARX517, ARX788, and ARX305. The acquisition will allow Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to leverage Ambrx's (NASDAQ:AMAM) ADC technology to eliminate cancer cells using monoclonal antibodies linked to a potent chemotherapeutic payload.\n\nWall Street is positive on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). On January 9, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen reiterated an Overweight rating on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and maintained her price target of $215. Over the past 3 months, 7 Wall Street analysts have held a buy opinion on the stock. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has an average price target of $178.08 and a high forecast of $215.\n\nNow that we have discussed some notable dividend stocks, let's take a look at the 20 worst states for dividend income investors.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks on the Brink of Soaring 50% or More",
        "content": "The new year is upon us, and investors cannot ignore the best growth stocks to buy. The stock market ascension in 2023 was led by mega-cap technology stocks, and this year’s gains will be spread more broadly. However, that doesn’t mean that some of the market leaders are not set for continued momentum.\n\nTalks about an impending recession continue to loom on Wall Street, making investors wary of the future that’s ahead. Inflation remains sticky, and many economists believe that rate cuts might not come until the back half of 2024. But the truth is that it is trending in the right direction, and there are many promising signs of a new bull market underway. That is why now is a great time to search for companies that can outperform the market.\n\nBelow are 3 growth stocks on the brink of soaring 50% or more in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) should be at the top of your list of the best growth stocks to buy in 2024. Not too long ago, the company plunged from record highs as it suffered from the advent of inflation and higher interest rates.\n\nIt was certainly not a pleasant sight for Meta, as the company is heavily reliant on its advertising revenue. However, in 2023 Meta’s restructuring efforts and cost-cutting measures have been material. This has allowed them to increase operating income in FY23, despite their colossal losses of $46.5 billion at their Meta Reality Labs division.\n\nIn Q3 2023, Meta’s revenue increased 23% YOY to $34.1 billion. Net income increased to 163% YOY to $11.58 billion, or $4.39 per share. During the quarter, Meta’s headcount decreased by 24% with layoffs being a large part of their cost-cutting measures. While the company expects CAPEX infrastructure costs to increase in FY24, Meta’s generative AI strategy is just beginning to take shape.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed across\n\nSource: xalien / Shutterstock\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is undoubtedly one of the top growth stocks to consider for this year. The company is about to close off a strong 2023 fiscal year, primarily driven by restructuring efforts and new business prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a year of declining advertising revenue in FY22, Netflix has made a complete turnaround and the future looks bright. They have not only cracked down on password sharing, but their new ad-plan membership continues to gain momentum. Netflix raised prices for both its basic and premium plans, with its new ad-plan membership growing 70% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nIt is clear that their new ad-plan membership is working after reporting global subscribers of 8.76 million in Q3 2023. Netflix expects FY23 FCF of $6.5 billion, up from their previous forecast of $5 billion. With management’s plan to accelerate revenue growth and expand operating margin in FY24, now is a great time to scoop up shares in the new year.\n\nCheck Point Software (CHKP) An image of the word cybersecurity overlaid over a pixelated background, images of locks and shields and virus icons surrounding it\n\nSource: BeeBright / Shutterstock\n\nCheck Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) may have stolen the show when considering the best growth stocks of 2024. The cybersecurity industry is set for rapid growth over the next decade, and Check Point might be the most compelling investment idea.\n\nThere is a strong likelihood that you may have never heard of this company before. However, they have been operating in the cybersecurity industry for more than 3 decades now. What makes this company stand out amongst its competitors is its history of strong financial performance.\n\nOver the last decade, Check Point has consistently grown its revenue and EPS. In Q3 2023, security subscription revenue increased 15% YOY. EPS increased 19% YOY to $1.75 per share, with operating income representing 38% of revenues. Check Point completed 3 acquisitions in Q3, including the acquisition of Perimeter 81 to deliver faster full-stack SASE solutions. With the cybersecurity race in full effect, Check Point remains a top growth stock that investors cannot ignore in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 AR Stocks to Bet On Ahead of Apple’s Vision Pro Release",
        "content": "Over the last few years, investors have become increasingly interested in the idea of virtual reality (VR), or augmented reality (AR), as a broad opportunity. The emergence of the metaverse during the pandemic served to heat up conversation around the topic. And the apparent opportunity has only become clearer as the technology has developed. With this, AR stocks are on the rise.\n\nWith an expected CAGR above 24% between 2024 and 2029, the virtual reality market and stocks therein are very attractive. There’s also more immediate news that will inspire investors in the coming weeks – Apple is set to release its Vision Pro in early February. Its release will prompt greater interest in the sector overall and is a great reason for investors to consider directing money into these firms at the moment.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nThe News that Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro will be on store shelves on Feb. 2 makes it the most important stock in this conversation. The Vision Pro won’t contribute much to Apple’s fundamentals in the near term but that doesn’t mean it won’t serve to propel its shares higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe simple truth is that despite the Vision Pro’s high price of $3,499, sales aren’t expected to be particularly significant. Recent estimates suggest that Apple could sell about 1 million of the headsets in 2024. That means the company will only see a few billion dollars extra in revenues from The Vision Pro at best. Frankly, that doesn’t move the needle much for Apple due to its massive size.\n\nSo, why then should investors assume that the release of the Vision Pro will positively affect Apple’s share price? The most obvious answer is that sales could dramatically increase in the next few years, for one. In time, the Vision Pro could contribute significantly to Apple’s fundamental growth. And two, Apple has an incredibly strong track record of impactful product releases that tend to do very well.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) As Free Cash Flow Continues Rolling, So Will Facebook Stock\n\nSource: fyv6561 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has long been one of the leading names in the development of the virtual reality space. The company then known as Facebook acquired AR firm Oculus in 2014. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long been a strong proponent of virtual reality dating back beyond the metaverse branding pivot in 2021.\n\nBack in 2017 Zuckerberg announced at the Oculus Connect conference that he wanted to get 1 billion people in virtual reality. That was a bold assertion at the time given that the company had only sold roughly 1 million VR headsets at that point.\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg has not slowed down which was made all the more clear by the company’s brand pivot and renaming to Meta Platforms in late 2021. Fast forward a few years, and the company had sold more than 20 million VR headsets through early 2023.\n\nObviously 20 million is well short of 1 billion, but Meta Platforms is well positioned to chase that goal moving forward. Apple’s early February release of the Vision Pro 2 will rekindle interest in Meta Platforms as it chases that goal.\n\nUniversal Display Corporation (OLED) OLED screen representing OLED stock\n\nSource: Daniel Pieterson / Shutterstock.com\n\nUniversal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) supplies organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) that are critical to the manufacturer of VR/AR headsets. All kinds of companies including Sony (NYSE:SONY) and Apple use OLED in their headsets, making Universal Display Corporation an interesting stock to consider.\n\nInvestors should also note that Universal Display Corporation is positively regarded on Wall Street. Its shares currently benefit from an overall ‘buy’ rating and moved up from a lower ‘overweight’ rating just a month ago. The high target price among the 12 analysts with coverage suggests that OLED shares could rise by 50% in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nInformation regarding some of the company’s more than 5,500 current patents can be found here. The overall thrust, though, is clear – Universal Display Corporation is well positioned to benefit from licensing opportunities as the virtual reality space continues to develop. Companies like Sony and Apple will continue to purchase the rights to that technology. That truth is all the more pertinent as Apple gears up to release the Vision Pro in the coming weeks.\n\nUnity Software (U) The Unity Software website is displayed on a laptop screen. U stock\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) will continue to be an interesting stock to consider in the VR space for one simple fact: graphics are incredibly important to the success or failure of the entire sector. The company has developed software that allows developers to create the 3D images used throughout them. If those images are subpar, disaster is not far away.\n\nFor example, remember when Mark Zuckerberg and Meta Platforms first released their demos of the Metaverse? The graphics were downright childish and led to wide derision of the company’s Metaverse pivot. It wasn’t the end and that demo also did not fully represent the firm’s graphical capability. However, it does reinforce the idea that quality graphics are vitally important throughout the industry.\n\nMore to the point, Apple and Unity Software are already partners. The release of the Vision Pro in early February should serve to redirect investors again toward Unity software and its shares.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Unity Software, is a very important stock to consider in virtual reality in relation to the importance of graphics. Nvidia’s GPUs are known to be the very best and benefit from wide application in gaming consoles and PCs.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is that the world of virtual reality/mixed reality/augmented reality requires even better graphical capabilities. Users demand strong graphics first and foremost whereas graphics are less important in platform gaming. Nvidia has created a developer tool kit which is geared toward virtual reality.\n\nIn short, Nvidia’s graphical prowess is very well known at this point. The company clearly has a strong opportunity in the continued development of the virtual reality space and a highly established name overall. Its chips continue to be in high demand for multiple applications including virtual reality.\n\nFurther, Nvidia obviously has and will continue to have a massive opportunity in relation to artificial intelligence. Thus, its shares expose investors to multiple paths toward continued strong growth overall.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the largest tech companies in existence. Silicon Valley firms have a presence across almost any given area of technology. Thus, it shouldn’t surprise readers to understand that the company has a significant role in the development of virtual reality. MSFT stock is strong for many reasons with the VR opportunity serving to further bolster investor confidence.\n\nThat statement might seem a bit contradictory given recent news around Microsoft’s Windows VR headsets. The company announced in December that it was discontinuing those headsets, which have thus far been slower sellers relative to those of competitors throughout Silicon Valley.\n\nIt’s difficult to believe that Microsoft will scrap the project on a wholesale scale. The company’s HoloLens 2 has a wide enterprise level application. firms are using it to enhance productivity and capability in workplace situations. Despite some clear setbacks to date, anticipate that Microsoft will figure out a way to make money from future continued development of virtual reality. The company has shown a continued investment in the artificial intelligence space which only makes that possibility greater.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Is another firm that has a wide footprint across the technology sector. Like Microsoft, Qualcomm is a very well established player in Silicon Valley. Both stocks are very stable overall and are strong choices for investors looking to gain exposure to VR without substantial risk.\n\nLet’s begin with looking at the reasons to consider Qualcomm for the short to medium term. Most importantly, Qualcomm recently extended its contract with Apple through 2026. That contract provides Qualcomm with a lot of stability that eases prior concerns. As much as Apple would like to bring more of its chip production in house, it simply isn’t as easy as wishing it to be. Qualcomm continues to provide technology that Apple is incapable of replicating. The long and short of that truth is that Qualcomm will continue to be a steady stock in the coming years.\n\nIn short, Qualcomm is a very stable stock. That notion is reinforced by the fact that the company pays a dividend yielding roughly 2.3% last reduced more than two decades ago.\n\nAll of that said, Qualcomm is leveraging its well regarded Snapdragon chips for the development of virtual reality. Further, the company has developed its own virtual reality/augmented reality glasses. Qualcomm continues to be a strong stable stock overall and one that should benefit from increased interest following the release of the Vision Pro headset.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "If You'd Invest $350,000 in the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, Here's How Much You Could Earn in Dividends",
        "content": "A group of technology giants dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" was responsible for a large proportion of the 26.3% gain in the S&P 500 last year. That's because their collective valuation of $12 trillion makes up 28% of the index, so they have a huge influence over the direction of the broader market.\n\nThese are the Magnificent Seven stocks, and how they performed in 2023: NVDA Total Return Price Chart\n\nThe Equal Weight S&P 500 index -- which assigns an identical weighting to all 500 stocks -- finished 2023 with a gain of just 11.5%. It highlights just how impactful the surging Magnificent Seven returns were on the actual S&P 500. If you didn't own that group of stocks last year, your portfolio probably lagged the market.\n\nBut it's not all about blockbuster gains, because some of the Magnificent Seven stocks also pay dividends. I'm going to show you how much you could earn with a $350,000 investment split equally across the seven stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence, cloud computing, electric vehicles, and more\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies operate across every major segment of the technology sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the largest driver of value in 2023, which is why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) led the group higher. Its H100 and upcoming H200 data center chips are designed to process AI workloads, and demand continues to surge as more businesses seek to develop AI applications.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are some of the world's largest data center operators, and therefore some of Nvidia's biggest customers. They use those centralized data centers to deliver cloud services -- and the computing power necessary to develop AI -- to millions of businesses around the world. Plus, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet offer cloud customers a growing number of large language models (LLMs), which are the building blocks of many AI applications.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using AI to show more relevant content to each of its 3.1 billion monthly users. The company also created an LLM of its own called Llama, which is open source, so any developer can use it to build advanced AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) created its own LLM in-house, which it's using to develop an AI chatbot similar to ChatGPT. It will pair nicely with the company's latest iPhone 15, because it's fitted with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which is capable of processing AI workloads on-device. This will place AI at the fingertips of billions of people around the world.\n\nFinally, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was the world's leading electric vehicle company by sales up until the end of 2023, when it was edged out by China-based BYD. However, Tesla's future will likely be determined by the success of its AI-powered autonomous self-driving vehicle technology. It's yet to be publicly released, but it has the potential to transform the company's economics. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThree of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay dividends\n\nSome companies generate so much profit they can't possibly reinvest it all into their operations to fuel more growth, so they pay some of it to shareholders instead. Dividends are the most common form of distribution, and they usually come as quarterly cash payments.\n\nApple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that pay dividends. Each of them less than a 1% yield, which are the payouts investors can expect to receive annually, calculated based on the value of their holdings. MSFT Dividend Yield Chart\n\nYields often change. If a stock doubles, its yield will halve organically unless the company raises its dividend. It doesn't mean the payout shrinks in dollar terms, but it falls as a percentage of the value of your investment.\n\nMicrosoft offers the highest yield, and while it seems small at face value, it translates to around $20 billion in dividend payments each year based on its current market capitalization of $2.8 trillion.\n\nIf you'd invested $350,000 in the Magnificent Seven (split equally with $50,000 invested into each stock) you would earn a dividend yield of 0.37% on $150,000, and no yield on the other $200,000. That translates to an effective yield of 0.18% on the $350,000, or an annual payment of $659.56.\n\nIt's a paltry sum given the yield investors can earn on cash in a savings account right now, but it's a nice bonus on top of the spectacular capital growth these stocks have delivered over the past year.\n\nDividends aren't the only form of distribution\n\nA dividend isn't the only way companies return money to shareholders. They can also execute stock buyback programs, where they purchase their own shares on the open market. Those shrink the number of available shares in circulation, which leads to a higher price per share.\n\nStock buybacks are preferable to dividends for many companies, because they give them the flexibility to distribute the money at a time of their choosing -- they aren't locked into paying out a specified sum each quarter.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven companies have active share repurchase programs, worth a combined $186.6 billion over the last 12 months. Tesla and Amazon are the two without active programs. AAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nAre the Magnificent Seven stocks still a buy now?\n\nAs I touched on at the top, investors who didn't own the Magnificent Seven stocks in 2023 likely underperformed the S&P 500 index. The law of large numbers makes it somewhat counterintuitive to expect these enormous companies to continue delivering the best returns in the entire market, because it gets harder for them to grow their revenue and earnings each year.\n\nHowever, it so happens that the Magnificent Seven companies operate at the forefront of the fastest growing industries in the world. For any investor seeking exposure to technologies like AI, cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, or electric vehicles, it's nearly impossible to look past these stocks.\n\nDepending on which Wall Street forecast you rely on, AI alone could add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade. Each of the Magnificent Seven already has a foothold in the industry, and they will likely deploy their considerable financial resources to ensure they capture a large slice of the opportunity.\n\nTherefore, the Magnificent Seven will likely be a great place for investors to park their money for the long term, and any dividends earned are an added bonus.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "content": "Historically, the U.S. stock market is an excellent means of creating generational wealth, especially for long-term investors who hold on to their winning investments despite short-term noise. For example, $1,000 invested in the S&P 500 in 1950 would have grown to over $2.6 million by 2023, despite the multiple boom and bust cycles.\n\nHowever, to benefit from the stock market's power of compounding, it is also essential for investors to choose high-quality stocks with strong fundamentals and robust growth prospects. Here's why Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) fit the bill and can prove to be smart long-term buys now.\n\nNvidia\n\nPreviously famous for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and advanced gaming hardware, Nvidia is now better known for its indisputable leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Consumer internet companies, cloud service providers, and enterprises have been increasingly using Nvidia's GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), networking technologies, and AI-optimized software solutions to build the infrastructure needed for running power-hungry and complex generative AI applications.\n\nNvidia expects even more demand for its chips from sovereign AI cloud and regional AI cloud providers, as data and application security have become a priority for governments across the world. Enterprises such as Snowflake, ServiceNow, Adobe, and Databricks are increasingly integrating AI copilots and assistants in their platforms. Many companies across various industries are also building customized AI applications. The increasing adoption of AI by enterprises is driving up demand for Nvidia's accelerated computing solutions. Not surprisingly, Citi analyst Christopher Danely expects the company to account for at least a 90% share of the AI chip market in future years.\n\nBesides AI hardware, Nvidia is also making major strides in its software business. The company expects to end fiscal 2024 (ending Jan. 31, 2024) with an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for recurring software, support, and services offerings. Nvidia has also pointed out DGX Cloud service and AI Enterprise software as two major growth opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia licenses its DGX Cloud service (which gives access to AI models, software, security services, researchers, and engineers) to enterprise customers to enable them to build customized generative AI applications. DGX Cloud service is also integrated with Nvidia's AI enterprise software (enterprise-grade software suite optimized for AI workloads and closely integrated with Nvidia hardware).\n\nAll these initiatives have translated into solid financial success for Nvidia. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company reported a 206% year-over-year revenue increase, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were 6 times more on a year-over-year basis. Analysts are also expecting the company's revenue to grow 232% year over year to $20.1 billion and earnings per share to grow by 411% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global AI market is estimated to grow from $515.3 billion in 2023 to just over $2 trillion in 2030. Considering Nvidia's dominance in the rapidly growing AI market and its annual run rate of just $44.9 billion, there is still much scope for growth in the coming years.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAfter a difficult 2022, social media giant Meta Platforms' share prices rose nearly 185% in 2023. However, the stock's upward trajectory may not be yet over and there are still many reasons to like this company.\n\nFirst, Meta Platforms owns and operates multiple social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, which together command nearly 3.96 billion monthly active users. With the company's user base accounting for more than 40% of the global population, Meta's platforms have become indispensable for the majority of advertisers.\n\nSecond, Meta is witnessing an acceleration in advertising revenue across multiple geographic segments. Increasing spending from Chinese advertisers targeting international markets and rising advertising demand in South Asian markets emerged as major growth drivers.\n\nThird, Meta has introduced new generative AI-powered advertising features such as text variations, image expansion, and background generation. These tools have been included in the Advantage+ solutions catalogue to make it easier for advertisers to create impactful advertisements. The Advantage+ shopping campaigns have already reached a $10 billion run rate, while over half of the company's advertisers are also using these tools.\n\nFourth, Meta has also managed to increase user engagement with AI-driven feed recommendations on Facebook and Instagram. In the third quarter, AI-driven recommendations resulted in a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, and a 6% increase in time spent on Instagram.\n\nBusiness messaging is also growing on Meta's platforms. With 600 million conversations between people and businesses daily, click-to-message advertising can prove to be a big opportunity for the company.\n\nFinally, Meta is also investing in new data center architecture to improve cost efficiencies and increase planning flexibility for new GPU and CPU capacity.\n\nAll these tailwinds have made Meta a compelling pick for 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Q3 Social Networking Earnings: Snap (NYSE:SNAP) Impresses\n\nLooking back on social networking stocks' Q3 earnings, we examine this quarter's best and worst performers, including Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and its peers.\n\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nThe 4 social networking stocks we track reported a mixed Q3; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 2.8% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Stocks have been under pressure as inflation (despite slowing) makes their long-dated profits less valuable, but social networking stocks held their ground better than others, with the share prices up 32.9% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nBest Q3: Snap (NYSE:SNAP)\n\nFounded by Stanford University students Evan Spiegel, Reggie Brown, and Bobby Murphy, and originally called Picaboo, Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) is an image centric social media network.\n\nSnap reported revenues of $1.19 billion, up 5.3% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 7%. It was a strong quarter for the company, with a decent beat of analysts' revenue estimates and solid growth in its user base.\n\n“Our revenue returned to positive growth in Q3, increasing 5% year-over-year and flowing through to positive adjusted EBITDA as our reprioritized cost structure demonstrated the leverage in our business model,” said Evan Spiegel, CEO. Snap Total Revenue\n\nSnap achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group. The company reported 406 million daily active users, up 11.8% year on year.

        "title": "If You Can Only Buy One Blue-Chip Stock in January, It Better Be One of These 7 Names",
        "content": "If you’re looking for reliability, you can’t go wrong with most of the blue-chip stocks.\n\nYou get proven businesses that have stood the test of time. Better, you’re investing in a company that’s not likely to go out of business any time soon. All because most offer products and services millions of us use every day. Plus, with many of the top blue-chip stocks you can even collect yield from them along the way.\n\nLook at AT&T (NYSE:T), for example. After a miserable year for the telecom stock, I mentioned it as a beaten-down blue-chip stock opportunity on Nov. 17. At the time, it traded at $15.60. Not long after, it would hit a high of $17.47, with a near 7% yield to boot.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition to AT&T, here are some other top blue-chip stocks you can buy on the cheap.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Southwest Airlines (LUV) Southwest Airlines logo on aircraft that is taking off from McCarran in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nSource: Eliyahu Yosef Parypa / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Nov. 17, I also highlighted an opportunity in Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), as it traded at $24.50.\n\nAt the time, I noted, “the airline stock plummeted to a low of $22.01 – a low it hasn’t seen since 2014. However, with a good deal of negativity priced into the stock, the pullback appears a bit overdone.” Not long after, LUV would hit $29.84 and could see higher highs. Better, as we wait for further recovery, we can collect its current yield of 2.41%.\n\nHelping, analysts at Susquehanna just raised their price target to $30 from $23 on the LUV stock. “The firm believes 2024 is setting up to be a year where idiosyncratic factors drive absolute and relative stock returns for the airlines, with network exposure, the ‘premiumization’ of travel, fleets and order books, labor, service, and cost control driving the investment narratives and debates,” as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) the front wheels of a series of cars in a line\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nI also highlighted Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) on Nov. 17, as it traded at around $136. While it’s only up to $138.43, give it time. I still believe it could refill its bearish gap around $147.50, with patience. Plus, as we wait for that to happen, we can collect its yield of 2.75%. There’s nothing wrong with getting paid to wait – especially with a top blue-chip stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, earnings haven’t been anything to write home about, but most of that negativity has been priced into the stock. In its most recent quarter, the company posted third quarter EPS of $2.49, which beat expectations by seven cents. Unfortunately, revenue of $5.82 billion – up 2.5% year-over-year – did miss by $90 million.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaper. Blue-Chip Stocks at Low\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there’s always an exchange-traded fund to buy into. With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG) invests at least 80% of its funds in blue chip companies. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and many more of the biggest, most well-respected stocks on the market.\n\nSince the end of October, the ETF did run from about $27.50 to a high of $33.70. At its current price, it has become slightly over-extended and could see a healthy pullback. So, you may want to wait for that to happen before jumping in. Longer-term, I’d like to see it closer to $40.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also Nike (NYSE:NKE).\n\nOver the last few weeks, the stock gapped from about $122.85 to $105.90. All on news of concerning sales outlook. However, it looks like most of that negativity has been priced in, with the stock attempting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. The last time these indicators became this oversold, NKE bounced from about $89 to $122.85. From its current price of $105.90, I’d like to see it refill its gap around $122.85 again soon.\n\nBetter, while we wait for NKE to recover, we can collect its yield of 1.4%. Furthermore, analysts at Truist just raised their price target on NKE to $111 from $107. Citi analysts have also called the pullback a buying opportunity, with a $135 price target.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks:Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe can also look at Realty Income (NYSE:O), which pays out a monthly dividend, and carries a current yield of 5.19%.  Most recently, the company declared its 643rd consecutive monthly dividend of $0.2565 per share, or $3.078 annualized, payable on Feb. 15 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 1.\n\nNot only is Realty Income a reliable, dividend-paying realty powerhouse, it’s been around for more than 50 years now.

According to the company, “P&G has been paying a dividend for 133 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890 and has increased its dividend for 67 consecutive years.”\n\nPlus, as a barometer of consumer strength, its earnings have been solid, too.  In its most recent quarter, the company posted core earnings of $1.83 a share on revenue of $21.9 billion. Analysts were only looking for $1.72 on $21.6 billion in sales.\n\n“We delivered very strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, putting us on track to deliver towards the higher end of our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales and core EPS growth,” said Jon Moeller, the company’s chairman and CEO.\n\nIn the long term, PG will remain one of the strongest, dividend-paying blue-chip stocks to own.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nOne of Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) delivers growth, reliability, and dividends. With a yield of 3.08%, the company recently paid out a 46-cent dividend on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record as of Dec. 1. I expect to hear of a newer dividend shortly.\n\nEarnings have been solid, too. In its most recent quarter, the company earned 74 cents a share on revenue of $11.95 billion. That was well ahead of expectations for 69 cents and revenue of $11.4 billion. Better, the company expects to grow organic sales by 10% to 11% from prior guidance of 8% to 9%, as noted by Barron’s contributor Teresa Rivas.\n\nHelping, analysts at Citi just raised their price target on KO to $67 with a buy rating.

In the fourth quarter, Wedgewood Composite’s net return was 11.4% compared to the Standard & Poor’s 11.7%, Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 14.2%, and Russell 1000 Value Index’s 9.5% return for the same period.

Core advertising revenue growth accelerated to +23% while operating margin rebounded strongly from a year ago. The Company has been a consistent beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past several years, investing aggressively in deep learning recommendation systems that help power its products, which reach nearly half the population of the planet. Meta Platform’s AI investments, combined with its massive scale, allow the Company to quickly spin up new products across its digital advertising real estate to reinforce its competitive positioning. For example, the Company's relatively new Reels product is just over two years old, yet it has driven a +40% increase in the time Instagram users spend on the app. Reels content and other content served up to Instagram users is often driven by several very large and expensive AI recommendation systems that must sort through billions of datapoints in real time and come up with a probability of a user engagement. The Company is one of the few companies that has been able to consistently and profitably monetize AI technologies for shareholders and we continue to hold it has a top position in our portfolios.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCopyright: rvlsoft / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 3 Red-Hot Tech Stocks That Could Split Their Shares in 2024",
        "content": "One of the most intriguing developments for investors over the past few years has been the return to popularity of stock splits. By and large, these moves have come on the heels of strong business performance, leading to equally strong stock price appreciation. Since stock splits don't have any effect on the underlying value of the business, the primary reason cited by companies is the desire to keep their shares affordable for the average retail investor.\n\nA look back at the past couple of years helps highlight this trend as numerous high-profile companies split their shares. These included:\n\nAmazon: 20-for-1 split June 3, 2022 DexCom: 4-for-1 split June 10, 2022 Shopify: 10-for-1 split June 28, 2022 Alphabet: 20-for-1 split July 15, 2022 Tesla: 3-for-1 split Aug. 24, 2022 Palo Alto Networks: 3-for-1 split Sept. 13, 2022 Monster Beverage: 2-for-1 split March 27, 2023 Celsius Holdings: 3-for-1 split Nov. 15, 2023\n\nA look at a few of the top-performing stocks of last year suggests there could be more stock splits on the docket in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is best known for pioneering the graphics processing units (GPUs) that render lifelike images in video games. Over the years, the company has adapted its chips to provide the computational horsepower necessary for cloud computing and data center uses and, most recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to data compiled by New Market Research, Nvidia currently controls roughly 95% of the market for processors used in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI. This suggests the company is well positioned to lead the generative AI market as well.\n\nRecent financial results seem to support that view. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), Nvidia delivered record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.71 surged 1,274%. Tepid results from the prior year skewed the comparison, but it helps illustrate the long runway ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has a long history of impressive growth, but excitement regarding its AI-fueled results drove the stock up 239% in 2023. Its performance is even more pronounced when considered over the past 10 years. Revenue has soared 1,480%, driving net income up 6,190%. This growth has fueled Nvidia's surging stock price, which is up more than 13,650%, with a price of $531 as of Tuesday's market close. Despite its performance, Nvidia still trades for a reasonable price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the benchmark for an inexpensive stock.\n\nThe company's most recent stock split was announced in May 2021 when the stock was trading at about $600 per share, just 13% above its current price. If things continue along the current trajectory -- and history is any indication -- it won't be long before Nvidia announces its next stock split.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is best known for its Office suite of productivity tools and ubiquitous Windows PC operating system. Last year, however, the company made a big splash in the field of generative AI. After taking a big stake in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, Microsoft released Copilot, a suite of AI-infused assistants designed to streamline mundane, time-consuming tasks. These moves kicked off the current AI arms race.\n\nStrong demand for Microsoft's AI tools helped kick-start growth for Azure Cloud, its \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure service. Not only did growth outpace its rivals in the calendar third quarter, but Microsoft also attributed three percentage points of that growth directly to demand for AI.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), Microsoft's revenue grew 13% year over year, while EPS climbed 27%. However, Copilot wasn't made available for general release until November, which means the impact hasn't yet hit the financial statements.\n\nMicrosoft has a long, distinguished track record of enviable growth, but the company's prescient AI moves helped drive the stock price up 57% in 2023. The results are even more compelling if we take a step back. Over the past decade, revenue has grown 177%, driving net income up 294%. This has pushed Microsoft's stock price higher, up nearly 817%, with a price of about $376 as of Tuesday's market close. The stock is selling for 33 times forward earnings but, considering its history, deserves a slight premium.\n\nThe company conducted nine stock splits between 1987 and 2003, rarely letting its stock price exceed $175. While Microsoft hasn't split its shares since 2003, the stock is now trading at a new all-time high of more than twice that price. And the company has only just scratched the surface of its AI opportunity, which suggests more stock price gains are ahead.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't indicated any plans for a stock split, but given its robust growth, this may be the year it joins its tech peers in splitting its high-priced shares.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\n2023 was a banner year for Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), with a number of catalysts helping lift the stock. The company's cost-cutting campaign showed dramatic results, digital advertising began to recover from its historic drought, and AI went viral. Each of these factors helped Meta regain its footing, which sent its stock up 194%.\n\nMeta's long history with AI helped the company pivot to capitalize on that expertise. Meta quickly developed Llama AI, which was released on all the major cloud services -- for a fee. Llama AI 2 was introduced late last year, and rumors suggest Llama 3 will debut in early 2024.\n\nIn the third quarter, Meta's revenue of $34.1 billion climbed 23% year over year, while its EPS of $4.39 surged 168% -- even as digital ad spending grew just 7.8% last year. As ad spending ramps back up, Meta's growth will get a boost.\n\nThen there's Advantage+, AI tools designed to empower advertisers on Meta's social media platforms. It has quickly become \"one of the fastest-growing ad products\" in Meta's history. A recent trial generated a 35% increase in return on ad spending and a 58% decrease in incremental costs per purchase. By streamlining and automating ad campaigns, Meta is simplifying the process, making it more profitable, and attracting more advertisers.\n\nMeta's growth last year was notable, but the past decade has been even more impressive. Revenue has grown by 1,260%, while net income surged 1,700%. This has fueled Meta's robust stock price gains of 493%, with the stock price of roughly $357 as of Tuesday's market close -- within 6% of a new all-time high. Not bad, considering Meta's stock is selling for a PEG ratio of less than 1.\n\nGiven its history of consistent growth and its ties to AI, 2024 could be the year Meta joins its big tech peers in conducting a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.\n\nLatest data shows that more and more Americans are investing in stocks, a trend that started during the COVID-19 pandemic days. In December, a Wall Street Journal report cited data from the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances which said that about 58% of U.S. households owned stocks in 2022, up from 53% in 2019. This was the highest household stock-ownership rate recorded in the survey that is conducted after every three years. This data shows that the rise of individual investors seen after the pandemic was not a temporary trend. As millions of Americans received stimulus checks during the pandemic days, they turned to retail investing platforms like Robinhood and other investing apps to pile into stocks. That trend is still going on despite the massive decline in stocks seen in 2022 following the inflation storm and rate hikes.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we used Robinhood Investor Index (which shows the most popular stocks on the investing platform Robinhood), some research reports and screeners highlighting the most popular stocks among individual investors to find out 16 most widely held stocks among individual investors.

GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) has fallen from its glory days when it skyrocketed thanks to the short squeeze launched by retail investors on Reddit. The stock has lost about 14% in value over the past one year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.00, beating estimates by $0.08.

Invesco QQQ ETF\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nInvesco QQQ ETF tracks the NASDAQ-100 index and gives investors exposure to some of the top technology and growth stocks. Over the past few years it has become one of the most famous ETFs among individual investors.\n\n10. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains one of the most favorite stocks of individual investors.

Wood's ARK Investment Management which owns a stake worth over $1 billion.\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it's relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.\"\n\n9. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 82\n\nThere has been an increase in popularity of broader market ETFs and index funds among individual investors especially after the inflation storm and rate hikes.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is among the most held ETFs by individual investors.\n\n8. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 89\n\nAccording to Robinhood index tracker, Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most popular stocks on the Robinhood platform.\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) has been seeing a lot of activity in the hedge fund space as it prepares to enter a battle with Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners. Peltz is seeking two board seats at Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS).\n\nActivist hedge fund Blackwells Capital will nominate three directors to Walt Disney Co’s (NYSE:DIS) board in support of Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and ValueAct Capital Management recently entered an agreement according to which Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) will provide information to the investment firm and consult with ValueAct on strategic matters, including through meetings with the Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) Board and management.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).  The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.\"\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has made a comeback against NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) by launching new chips for AI and the company plans to continue to up its AI game.\n\nWells Fargo analysts led by Aaron Rakers earlier this month said in a note that they like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the current levels as they believe the semiconductor industry is set for a rebound.\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD's data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company's AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD's product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD's inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock's strong performance run, led us to trim the position.\"\n\n6. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 180\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has seen a huge rise in popularity among retail and institutional investors amid the AI boom. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 234% over the past one year, with many analysts repeatedly saying there’s a lot more room to run for the stock because of a burgeoning demand for AI chips.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, hedge funds and retail investors are piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\n\n\"Much of that differential can be attributed to the performance of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla), a basket of mega cap growth stocks that accounted for 47.8% of the benchmark return for the quarter and 65.4% for 2023.\n\nThe ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy maintains exposure to six of the seven stocks, with overweights in Amazon.com, Meta and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those three stocks, as well as Microsoft, were among the leading contributors to Strategy performance for the quarter. Microsoft and Nvidia continued to be supported by strong execution and leadership positions in the implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThese are high-quality, cash flow generative businesses that we will continue to own, actively adjusting our positioning sizes based on risk/reward and portfolio construction priorities. With Nvidia shares more than tripling in 2023, we opportunistically took profits throughout the year, an approach that continued in the fourth quarter with additional trims that brought the position down to 6% of overall assets.\n\nActive management of our mega cap exposure contributed to the Strategy outperforming the benchmark both in the fourth quarter and through the narrow leadership market of 2023. We also attribute these improved results to solid stock picking, being opportunistic in adding to or initiating new positions in growth companies at or near the bottom of their earnings cycle, and maintaining a commitment to diversification across our three buckets of growth: select, stable and cyclical.\"\n\nClick to continue reading and see 16 Most Widely Held Stocks by Individuals.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Analysts 11 Most Promising Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks According to Analysts 16 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "The 3 Best Web3 Stocks to Buy in January 2024",
        "content": "The best Web3 stocks this month will partially ride on the coattails of the most recent Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETF approval. The spot ETF for Bitcoin should drive significant growth for the cryptocurrency in the future. This is because ETF providers will be required to purchase a large amount of the coin, which could cause the crypto price to surge.\n\nThe other best Web3 stocks to look out for are ones that are powering other aspects of this next-generation internet. These companies have established a foothold in industries such as the metaverse, virtual reality, and the next generation of social media platforms. Some analysts anticipate that all of these separate catalysts will converge into one, making them complementary.\n\nSo, read here if you are looking for the best Web3 stocks to invest in for January. Here are the best companies to add to your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) continues to be important for U.S. cryptocurrency investors. It has managed to maintain its first-mover advantage in the face of larger competing platforms such as Binance. It has successfully rolled out many improvements and integrations over the years to keep its revenue from transaction fees rolling in.\n\nCOIN is expected to play a much larger role in the crypto ecosystem due to Bitcoin ETF approval. It has already recorded $7.7 billion in Bitcoin sales on the historic launch day of the ETF.\n\nI predict that investors (both retail and institutional) will continue to pour into these ETFs over time, and COIN will be the main conduit to facilitate these transactions for many.\n\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, expressed his views on the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs with optimism: “This is a monumental step for the crypto industry and for Coinbase,” he went on to say, “This ETF is really about unlocking new pools of capital that weren’t previously available.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the CEO’s assessment of COIN’s position is anything to go by, we can expect great things for this company for the rest of January and the rest of the year.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) also indirectly benefit from the Bitcoin ETF announcement, as it has a do-or-die strategy of bringing the metaverse idea to the masses. Those exposed to cryptocurrencies may explore other decentralized asset types and governance structures, which explore key themes in making virtual communities a closer part of our lives.\n\nThe main reason I’m bullish on META for this month is that analysts predict that the company could be in the process of making a big move. It’s relatively undervalued when comparing its trailing P/E and P/S ratios. Analysts predict these measures will improve significantly in the future.\n\nFurthermore, META stock carries a “Strong Buy” recommendation from Wall Street, along with some forecasts to suggest its share could climb to $400 and above.\n\nSpecifically, analysts predict META’s revenue will climb to 154.05B this year for a 13.08% YoY increase. Its EPS is also predicted to shoot up to 17.74 for a solid 21.19% return. This then makes META one of those best Web3 stocks to buy.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is in a slightly different position than the other companies, but I believe a strong upside remains for this pick.\n\nThis company provides some of the ‘picks and shovels’ to allow key Web3 trends such as augmented reality and the metaverse to take shape. Its Unity gaming engine is also highly popular with independent and large publishers alike.\n\nThis may sound paradoxical, but a key reason to be bullish on Unity this year is that it announced a series of layoffs, with its most recent affecting 25% of its staff members.\n\nAll else being equal, companies tend to do better after removing that kind of overhead. This is both from a company performance and stock price perspective. Smaller businesses are generally leaner and more efficient due to having fewer moving parts, making them simpler to manage and execute management’s strategy.\n\nThe layoffs were in response to management’s need to focus on its Unity Game engine, part of a business segment the company is now leaning on to derive its future earnings.\n\nUnity has bled cash flow for some time, but these changes and its broader restructuring process should get Wall Street analysts to finally put the company in the black. This makes it one of those best Web3 stocks to buy in January.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here's What Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) Strong Returns On Capital Mean",
        "content": "If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Meta Platforms:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.24 = US$44b ÷ (US$216b - US$31b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nTherefore, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 24%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 9.0%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Meta Platforms' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nMeta Platforms deserves to be commended in regards to it's returns. The company has employed 114% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 24%. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Meta Platforms' ROCE\n\nIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 150% return they've received over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Meta Platforms, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our freelist of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "10 Best AI Stocks for 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the10 Best AI Stocks for 2024. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article 5 Best AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nThe latest inflation report has yet again made investors uneasy about the Fed's possible path forward. The persistent shadow of inflation is perhaps here to stay for some time and investors will adapt to this new environment. Stifel said in its 2024 outlook report themed \"Embracing Change\" that higher rates are \"here to stay\" as the firm expects muted but positive returns for stocks this year. However, Stifel said that inflation is clearly showing signs of deceleration and risks are now \"balanced.\"\n\nStifel recommended long-term investors to maintain their \"composure\" in 2024 and embrace the fact that change is the only constant in life. While sooner or later inflation will recede and rates will come down, what is here to stay and change the course of human progress is AI, which, according to Stifel, \"stands on the cusp of reshaping industries and the economy.\"\n\nThe AI revolution is that once-in-a-century kind of phenomenon that will shape and impact our society at every level. PwC said in a report said that its 2023 Emerging Technology Survey showed that just one year after the launch of ChatGPT, 54% of the surveyed companies had already implemented generative AI in some areas of their business. Companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are already launching AI products and services affecting billions of users around the globe. Best AI Stocks for 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this context, we decided to take look at some of the top AI stocks that hedge funds are piling into. For this article we first listed all popular companies that are set to gain and profit from the latest AI trends. These companies are receiving bullish comments, ratings upgrades and price target hikes from analysts because of their products and services related to AI. From this long list of stocks we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. The idea was to see which AI-related stocks are the favorites of smart money investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the most notable stocks that is gaining attention on the back of AI-related catalysts. Dan Ives of Wedbush in December listed the stock among his favorite AI and tech plays of 2024.\n\n\"While IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, we believe cloud and AI driven spending will be up 20%-25% over the next year with use cases now exploding across the enterprise and consumer landscape,” Ives said in his note.\n\nCharlotte AI is one of the generative AI products offered by Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) that have been making waves. Charlotte AI is a chatbot which can be probed by end users and security analysts regarding their system’s deficiencies and best security practices.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike gained amid resilient cybersecurity spend, continued revenue growth against well-managed expenses, and traction in endpoint adjacencies.\n\nWe have underscored that the purpose of our risk management framework is to enhance value creation and aid in the execution and implementation of our investment program. However, this stage of risk management best manifests itself in down markets as it did in 2022. This year has been quite different since equities have broadly recovered, and our risk management focus has shifted toward establishing a level of permanence. We characterize this phase of risk management as Value Capture. Essentially, we have harvested disproportionate equity outcomes (Nvidia)and other strong performers (Passport holdings such as CrowdStrike) to fund a ~700bps increase in our India weighting (Makemytrip, Apollo Healthcare), a 235bps investment in Coca Cola (in correlation terms the real thing), and even a 114bps position in Alibaba (6.6X consensus 2023 EPS at purchase). These investments are not risk free, but they are stores of value that have the potential to enhance diversification and staying power in any market reversal. Moreover, we have marginally reduced portfolio concentration over the course of the year. Essentially, 2022 was a moment of extremely low reinvestment risk that allowed us to deemphasize China and other holdings, while concentrating around a handful of financially and strategically sound investments such as Nvidia, MercadoLibre, Airbnb and CrowdStrike.With these investments having largely reflated, we have sought to redistribute some of this capital while retaining significant residual positions. It is our hope that these actions can enhance our ability to execute our investment program if, for example, market exuberance about monetary policy proves excessive.”\n\n9. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 112\n\nAdobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the companies best positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) has integrated AI features in its product suite that allows end users to simply give text-based commands to design graphics and edit photos. These features are expected to increase Adobe Inc's (NASDAQ:ADBE) product demand.\n\nJim Cramer said in a program a few months back that Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) made the “best use of AI.”\n\nA total of 112 hedge funds out of the 109 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) as of the end of the third quarter. The most significant stakeholder of Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) was Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $2.3 billion stake in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nIn addition to Adobe, hedge funds are also piling into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 110\n\nMany analysts are betting that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) will be one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the AI boom. After all, Nvidia won’t be the only company making chips for generative AI systems. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has a history of catching up to its competition and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is already out with its new AI-focused chips.\n\nIn December, UBS called Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) one of its top semiconductor picks. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in his note that the semiconductor industry was entering a “sweet spot” and 2024 will see inventory converting to revenue.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 110 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”\n\n7. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 122\n\nEarlier this month, Bank of America added Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) in its top software stock picks for 2024.\n\n\"We expect mid-teen revenue growth, improving margins, multiple reversion and positive revisions to offset cyclical headwinds in [first-half of 2024] before driving a stronger [second half of 2024],” BofA’s Alkesh Shah said.\n\nAbout Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Shah said he sees \"enduring\" revenue growth in the mid-teens and increasing margins.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”\n\n6. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 221\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of frontrunners in the AI race since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) has the vantage point that allows it to integrate AI technologies into various services and products. Recently, BMO Capital Markets Brian Pitz said in a note that the blend of AI and content creation would help Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) along with several other tech companies. He started covering the stock with an Outperform rating.\n\nA total of 221 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds had stakes in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The biggest stakeholder of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) during this period was Ken Fisher’ s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $5.7 billion stake in Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included long positions in KKR, Ciena Corporation and Alphabet. Shares of media and technology company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) rose in the quarter as its advertising and cloud businesses remain robust and the company delivered results ahead of market expectations. From a sector perspective, communication services also managed a positive Q3 (2%), riding the ongoing wave of positive mega-cap stocks’ performance, like Alphabet.”\n\nLike Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet is also a hedge fund favorite when it comes to AI investing.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Hedge Funds 10 AI Stocks Billionaires Are Crazy About Jim Cramer’s 10 Best AI Stocks\n\nDisclosure.None. 10 Best AI Stocks for 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.",

Let’s take a look at how the social networking stocks have fared in Q3, starting with Pinterest (NYSE:PINS).\n\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nThe 4 social networking stocks we track reported a mixed Q3; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 2.8% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Inflation (despite slowing) has investors prioritizing near-term cash flows, but social networking stocks held their ground better than others, with the share prices up 34.7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS)\n\nCreated with the idea of virtually replacing paper catalogues, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is an online image and social discovery platform.\n\nPinterest reported revenues of $763.2 million, up 11.5% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 2.7%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a decent beat of analysts' revenue estimates but slow revenue growth.\n\n“We continued to accelerate the business in Q3,” said Bill Ready, CEO of Pinterest. Pinterest Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is up 50.4% since the results and currently trades at $37.7.\n\nIs now the time to buy Pinterest?

It was a strong quarter for the company, with a beat of analysts' revenue estimates and solid growth in its user base.\n\nStory continues Snap Total Revenue\n\nSnap achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The company reported 406 million daily active users, up 11.8% year on year. The stock is up 75.6% since the results and currently trades at $17.05.\n\nIs now the time to buy Snap?

It was a weak quarter for the company, with slow revenue growth and a miss of analysts' revenue estimates.\n\nNextdoor had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The company reported 40.4 million daily active users, up 5.5% year on year. The stock is down 9.9% since the results and currently trades at $1.64.\n\nRead our full analysis of Nextdoor's results here.\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META)\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Facebook Reality Labs.\n\nMeta reported revenues of $34.15 billion, up 23.2% year on year, surpassing analyst expectations by 2%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter. On the other hand, Meta beat analysts' revenue and EPS estimates this quarter, driven by better-than-expected monthly active user growth.\n\nMeta delivered the fastest revenue growth among its peers. The company reported 3.96 billion monthly active users, up 6.7% year on year. The stock is up 22.7% since the results and currently trades at $367.5.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Meta here, it's free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "title": "Nike: The Contrarian Trade of 2024",
        "content": "Everyone around the world knows about Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE). The American sportswear company has built a solid brand that is considered reliable and is regularly used by top athletes. Its presence is well implemented in many markets with a diversified partnership network.\n\nAnd yet, the stock has underperformed the broader market in each of the last three years. Returns for Nike were 18% in 2021, -30% in 2022 and -12% in 2023. If we compare with the S&P 500, its returns were 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022 and 24% in 2023. Nike has clearly been underperforming its index.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with NKE.\n\nFurther, the stock dropped on the last trading day before Christmas by approximately 12% on the back of disappointing third-quarter earnings and a grim 2024 outlook, breaking a little bit more the already poor morale of long-term investors. Despite the negative news, UBS reiterated at the end of December its buy rating on Nike with a $138 target.\n\nA closer look at earnings\n\nNike's earnings report disappointed investors for a third quarter in a row, with revenue coming in below expectations. Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend explained on a call with analysts that the adverse headwinds the company is facing include currency risk due to a strong dollar, making exports from the U.S. less competitive, and consumer weakness, particularly in China, where it generates around 15% of its revenue.\n\nWhile the Oregon-based company's earnings of $1.03 per share exceeded analysts' estimates of 85 cents, revenue of $13.39 billion was short of the projected $13.43 billion.\n\nAdditionally, Nike slashed its outlook for 2024 as China's economy struggles to reaccelerate and as the high federal funds rate is keeping the dollar strong, putting downward pressure on revenue. The revenue growth is expected to decline 1%, which is down from the previous guidance of around 5% growth.\n\nLooking at the financials, however, not everything is grim. Taking the last five years into consideration, Nike's revenue has climbed, on average, at a 7.1% growth rate. Ebitda margins, on the other hand, do not have a clear long-term trend and the restructuring plan announced during the earnings call will aim at rectifying that.\n\nStory continues Nike: The Contrarian Trade of 2024\n\nNKE Data by GuruFocus\n\nOn the valuation side, we can clearly see the stock is on the cheaper end with enterprise value/Ebitda in the lower 20s. Nike: The Contrarian Trade of 2024\n\nLast but not least, forward estimates indicate stable revenue growth and, more importantly, an increased efficiency at Nike with solid Ebitda growth after its restructuring. Nike: The Contrarian Trade of 2024\n\nNike could outperform in the next three years\n\nPurely from a corporate level, there is one big argument in favor of a turnaround: Nike's announced cost-cutting plan is a restructuring plan similar to the ones applied by some of the big tech companies such as Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) that has proven to be beneficial.\n\nEssentially, Nike has announced plans to slash $2 billion of expenses in 2024. The initial reaction of investors was obivously the fear that this initiative will reduce investments in growth, new product lines, improving the supply chain or expanding into promising markets such as India and the Middle East.\n\nHowever, looking into the different lines of the plan, it becomes clear that none of the latter is compromised. The plan will lead to a large restructuring that will initially cost around $400 millon to $450 million to implement and will actually simplify the corporate structure by significantly reducing the number of management layers and divisions, as well as increasing internal efficiency. To any investor, this plan is a welcome turnaround hope of a well-known brand that has the logistics, the network and the media attention to continue growing in existing markets and expand into new ones.\n\nAdditionally, there are several macro tailwinds awaiting the company. The obvious one is the likely Federal Reserve rate reduction (at least three rate cuts are expected this year per the fed dot plot), which could lead to a U.S. consumer demand uptick as interest rates drop. It would also make debt financing cheaper for Nike, though it has a net debt-to-EBITDA close to zero. On the other side of the Pacific, with China likely having to stimulate its economy aggressively, a quantitative easing program by the People's Bank of China could spark an intense buying spree among Chinese consumers.\n\nConclusion\n\nNike has had a couple of difficult years, with the most recent quarters being rather challenging, to say the least. And yet, given the solid brand name, the reliable supply chains and the established partnerships, the company has potential to return to a path of high growth. 2024 has several macro tailwinds in store for the athletic footwear and apparel sector, and if Nike successfully implements its ambitious restructuring plan, then it will likely remain one of the sector leaders and catch up on its performance.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Why META’s AI Thinks These 3 Tech Stocks Can Double in 2024",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence has exploded in terms of its capability in recent years, with tech giants racing to develop the most advanced AI systems. While not yet profitable, these AI chatbots serve an important purpose – sifting through massive datasets that no human could parse alone. Of course, they lack true understanding, but they excel at discovering intriguing patterns for us to evaluate.\n\nIn this spirit of experimentation, I asked Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) new Llama chatbot to suggest three overlooked tech stocks that could double in 2024. Llama joins Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in my lighthearted contest to see what stock ideas these AIs can generate. I take their suggestions with a huge grain of salt, viewing them only as thought-provoking suggestions. The real analysis is still up to us humans!\n\nWith that in mind, I’ll be looking at Llama’s three picks and commentating on them. Let’s start!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ll start by addressing the virtual elephant in the room – Llama’s first pick being its own maker, Meta Platforms. None of the other AI assistants I’ve tested so far have put their own company at the top of the list, so Llama gets points for shameless self-promotion! However, I have to disagree that META stock will double in 2024.\n\nDon’t get me wrong – I pounded the table on Meta being a strong buy back when shares traded around $90 per share. Since then, the stock has gained nearly 300% off its lows. But at its current levels, I believe Meta’s upside from here is limited. The company would need to flawlessly execute on multiple fronts to justify doubling again in the next 12 months.\n\nMeta faces uncertainty around the metaverse, and cutthroat competition from TikTok. Are these risks priced into the stock? Arguably so. But Meta likely needs a couple of catalysts to ignite the next leg higher. An advertising rebound, big metaverse announcements, or a slowdown in TikTok’s growth could do the trick. Still, I don’t see enough gas left in the tank for a doubling year.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon’t misinterpret me – I still believe Meta is a good long-term buy at current prices. But in the near-term, markets have likely priced in the good news. This isn’t the screaming bargain it was six months ago. Meta remains a solid stock for patient investors, just not one I expect to be a doubling candidate in 2024.\n\nShopify (SHOP) shopify logo sign on building facade\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nLlama’s next pick, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), could double this year under the right conditions. Yes, the same Shopify that already trades 77-times forward earnings and 12-times sales. I’ll explain why.\n\nShopify has cratered a stomach-churning 78% from all-time highs. So even after this year’s snapback rally, shares still sport a 52% discount from 2021 peaks. Merely reclaiming those losses would equate to a double from today’s prices.\n\nAnd Shopify deserves a premium valuation. Revenue grew 47% over the past three years (better than 92% of peers) despite 2022’s hiccups. Margins are expanding as operating leverage kicks in. And the company is putting up improving bottom-line results, with its Q3 earnings per share smashing estimates by 66%.\n\nDoubling from here will be challenging. But Shopify has levers to pull. Initiatives like international expansion, boosting its fulfillment network capacity, and growing its payments ecosystem can all drive upside surprises. If macro trends stabilize and e-commerce growth re-accelerates, shares could ride momentum back toward previous heights.\n\nI obviously can’t guarantee Shopify stock will double in 2024. But the company’s growth story, its reasonable valuation after the recent market beat-down, and potential upside catalysts make it possible if things break right. Of Llama’s three picks, this is the one I’m most bullish on for outsized returns this year.\n\nZoom Video (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLlama’s last selection, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), is another solid company facing some near-term headwinds. And while I don’t think Zoom will repeat its meteoric pandemic gains in 2024, I agree the company’s current valuation leaves room for upside.\n\nLet’s first level-set. Zoom is unlikely to recapture its former stay-at-home darling status anytime soon. Hybrid work is here to stay, limiting how video conferencing can penetrate the personal usage market. Revenue growth has already normalized to low-single digits, a far cry from triple-digit gains almost four years ago.\n\nThat said, Zoom emerged from the pandemic with $6.5 billion in cash and durable enterprise relationships. The company name has become synonymous with video meetings, enjoying wide brand recognition and integration. And priced at 14-times forward earnings, Zoom trades at a reasonable valuation for a steadily-growing company.\n\nIn my view, Zoom lands firmly in “show me” territory. This stock could fly higher if new offerings like Zoom Phone gain strong traction or new use cases emerge to recharge growth. But for now, I believe the stock’s valuation already captures realistic possibilities, given the slower demand backdrop.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The metaverse is working to revolutionize the world, including sectors like entertainment and education. Here we look at the top metaverse stock picks for 2024 and beyond.\n\nThe concept of the metaverse has evolved in recent years into a tangible near-term reality pursued by major companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) (formerly Facebook) and decentralized autonomous organizations. The metaverse seeks to blur the boundaries between physical and digital realities.\n\nThis development presents new revenue opportunities for a diverse range of participants, including retail investors, gamers, digital collectors, and developers. Along these lines, metaverse stock picks discussed below offer a solid exposure to this next-gen technology.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile gaming has already incorporated elements of the metaverse, its potential applications extend to various consumer realms. The metaverse could revolutionize entertainment and education, offering immersive experiences that go beyond traditional learning methods.\n\nAmerican users engaging in social media, streaming, and gaming collectively dedicate approximately 11 billion days annually to consuming digital media. Additionally, they invest around 14 billion days each year in watching traditional linear television. This substantial amount of time holds the potential to shift towards the metaverse in the future.\n\n“We think the metaverse is most likely going to be a next-generation social media, streaming, gaming and shopping platform,” Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Internet analyst Brian Nowak said.\n\n“In some ways, we already live in a metaverse, as shown by the total time spent by daily active users in the U.S. on digital platforms.”\n\nDespite its promising prospects, it’s crucial to recognize that the metaverse is still in its early stages, and its actual value proposition remains untested. Investments in this space should be approached with caution, considering the speculative and high-risk nature of the metaverse’s current development.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere are the metaverse stock picks investors should consider for 2024 and beyond.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms, is an internet titan that operates various platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta Platforms is actively involved in exploring the metaverse.\n\nWith initiatives like Horizon Workrooms and the development of virtual reality experiences, Meta is working towards creating immersive online environments. In 2023, the company made significant strides in its long-term investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse.\n\nThese two futuristic technologies showed notable progress and, more importantly, began to converge. Generative AI, a key focus for Meta, found its way into popular applications, while mixed reality became central to a mass-market headset. Notably, the integration of AI into Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses allows for a perspective-altering experience.\n\nMeta is reportedly planning to launch its initial smart glasses featuring a display in 2025, coupled with a neural interface smartwatch designed for control. These smart glasses aim to offer users a comprehensive augmented reality (AR) experience. In addition, Meta envisions the release of its first fully-fledged AR glasses in 2027.\n\nAccording to recent reports, Meta’s Reality Labs – a segment that hosts all metaverse-focused projects – now lost more than $21 billion since the beginning of 2022.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX), established in 2006, stands as an online metaverse platform enabling gamers to craft and share virtual worlds within the Roblox community. Over the years, Roblox has experienced substantial growth, becoming a prominent platform for user-generated content and social interaction in the virtual gaming space.\n\nIn November, Roblox disclosed a surge in performance, with 70.2 million average daily active users (DAUs), marking a 20% YoY increase. The company reported a loss per share of 45 cents, surpassing the expected 51 cents loss. Revenue, measured as bookings, reached $839 million, exceeding the projected $830 million.\n\nIn FQ2, users clocked over 16 billion hours on Roblox, reflecting a substantial 20% YoY uptick. Despite a net loss of $277.2 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30, an improvement is evident compared to the $297.8 million loss reported for the same period in 2022. The company reported a consistent year-over-year figure, stating that the average bookings per daily active user remained unchanged at $11.96.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a global leader in graphics processing unit (GPU) development and AI computing, remains a significant investor in the metaverse. As the company continues to generate massive cash flow, it allows it to innovate in GPUs for consoles, laptops, and PCs, serving various applications. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently projected that NVDA could generate $100 billion in FCF over the next 2 years.\n\nThe Omniverse platform, designed by the company, provides users with an array of tools and features for creating and customizing virtual worlds and experiences. Omniverse is a collaborative real-time 3D graphics platform that leverages technologies such as Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD), RTX, and generative AI. This platform empowers application developers to design, implement, and oversee sophisticated 3D applications and pipelines across diverse industries.\n\nBack in 2023, Nvidia teamed up with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the latter working to align itself with Nvidia’s internet services for creating hyper-realistic virtual worlds, Omniverse Cloud, and the AI supercomputing service, Nvidia DGX Cloud. Omniverse Cloud enables the construction and operation of immersive virtual environments, while DGX Cloud provides enterprises with immediate access to infrastructure and software for training advanced models in generative AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "U.S. CPI ahead, SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Traders are awaiting key U.S. inflation numbers for December, which could play into how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate reductions this year. Elsewhere, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves several applications to create spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, in a landmark decision for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n1. Crucial inflation data ahead\n\nHeadline U.S. inflation is expected to have sped up marginally in December, while the annual underlying reading is seen slowing, as Federal Reserve officials search for signs of easing price gains before rolling out possible interest rate cuts this year.\n\nEconomists estimate that the year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) from the world's largest economy accelerated to 3.2% last month, up from 3.1% in November. Month-on-month, the pace is projected to increase to 0.2%.\n\nBut the rate of the so-called \"core\" measure, which strips out volatile items like food and energy, is tipped to drop to 3.8%, down from 4.0% in the prior month. On a monthly basis, core CPI is anticipated to match November's figure of 0.3%.\n\nFed policymakers will likely be closely watching the data, which could factor into how they approach rate reductions later in 2024. In a speech on Wednesday, New York Fed President John Williams argued it is still too soon to call for cuts because inflation is well above the bank's stated 2% target.\n\nWilliams' comments echoed sentiments from other rate-setters, who have recently moved to temper soaring market enthusiasm for potential reductions early this year. This optimism, fueled in part by a dovish Fed outlook last month, drove a rally in stocks in the final weeks of 2023 that has since lost some steam.\n\n2. Futures edge higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Thursday, with traders gearing up for the publication of the inflation data at 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT).\n\nBy 05:04 ET (10:04 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 40 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had increased by 8 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 59 points or 0.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main indices on Wall Street closed in the green on Wednesday. The benchmark S&P 500 rose by 0.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed by 0.8%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 0.5%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) touched a fresh record high after peer TSMC posted fourth-quarter revenue that beat expectations, while Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit its highest intraday level since 2021 following a price target upgrade from anaysts at Mizuho.\n\nAlong with inflation, investors are awaiting a raft of financial results from major U.S. banks later in the week.\n\n3. SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBitcoin was trading higher on Thursday after the top U.S. securities regulator approved the first exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, Bitcoin had risen 1.4% to $46,283.4.\n\nIn a decision that is anticipated to have sweeping implications for the wider crypto industry, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light on Wednesday to 11 applications from a range of issuers, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity as well as digital currency asset manager Grayscale.\n\nSome proponents of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, have claimed that the SEC's approval would spark a rush of demand into the token. Through a spot Bitcoin ETF, investors will have the chance to gain exposure to the digital asset without directly owning it. Detractors have, however, flagged that ETFs could persuade retail traders to pour money into a sector that has been beset with a spate of fraud-related scandals and huge volatility.\n\nThe decision, which was backed by SEC Chair and known crypto-skeptic Gary Gensler, marked a U-turn for a commission that has largely been reticent to sign off on a spot Bitcoin ETF for much of the past decade. It also comes after hackers temporarily took control of the SEC's account on social media platform X on Wednesday and falsely claimed that the regulator had already approved the applications, sparking wild fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin.\n\n4. Google announces lay-offs across multiple teams - reports\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is dismissing hundreds of its employees across several divisions to decrease costs and support an ongoing push into artificial intelligence, according to media reports.\n\nCiting a Google spokesperson, the reports said the lay-offs will impact workers at the search giant's core engineering division. Hundreds of roles at its Voice Assistant division, as well as the hardware team behind its Pixel phone, Nest smart home devices, and Fitbit watches, will be eliminated.\n\nThe exact number of employees losing their jobs was not immediately specified by Google, the reports said.\n\nGoogle's cuts extend a continuing trend of job reductions in the tech industry. On Wednesday, e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reportedly laid off several hundred employees at its live-streaming unit Twitch, Prime Video service and MGM studios.\n\n5. Oil rebounds following U.S. inventories build\n\nOil prices rose Thursday, rebounding after the previous session’s weakness as attacks on shipping through the Red Sea persisted.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% higher at $72.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 1.8% to $78.18 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks settled lower on Wednesday after official data showed an unexpected weekly build of 1.3 million barrels in U.S. inventories, contrasting with earlier industry data that signaled a weekly draw.\n\nWhile the build was minimal, the data also showed a second straight week of large product inventory builds, pointing to softness in U.S. fuel demand. This notion was exacerbated by a severe winter storm on the east coast of the country, which further disrupted road travel in the world’s largest fuel consumer.\n\nHowever, the market remained supported by ongoing concerns about disruptions to Middle East supplies after Yemen-based Houthis mounted their largest attack yet on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. CPI ahead, SEC approves first spot Bitcoin ETFs - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ considers lowering FY2024 inflation outlook to mid-2% range - Jiji\n\nTrump's civil fraud trial: four key moments",

        "title": "The Top 7 AI Stocks (Not Named Nvidia) to Start 2024",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was by far the best AI stock of 2023. 2023 is over, but it was the year that artificial intelligence took off. AI stocks are facing something of a different environment in 2024.\n\nThe evolution of the sector continues and investors continue to seek higher sales as the leading indicator of success. By the way, that’s why Nvidia did so well last year: Demand for its products spiked sales while many other firms have yet to see top line results from AI.\n\nYet, other AI stocks continue to have plenty of potential to not only increase sales but to rise in price for other reasons. This article is dedicated to those firms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors just got a great chance to pick up AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock at lower prices. 2024 has started with something of a correction, especially in regard to tech and AI shares. The result is that AMD shares have fallen from $150 to $137 as I write this.\n\nMake no mistake about it, the so-called correction is primarily a result of investors securing gains immediately after the calendar tax year ends. It is not a reflection of the purported beginning of some long-term AI correction in 2024. That’s how I feel anyway and the fact that AMD shares are rebounding seem to confirm my suspicion.\n\nI continue to argue that AMD is the number one contender in the AI space at the moment. The company will release its mi300 chips at some point in 2024. That will give the firm’s shares a very strong positive catalyst in their favor. It’s very evident that the top tech firms across Silicon Valley are interested in the chips as a way to reduce costs as an alternative to Nvidia’s highly priced h100 chips.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a very good year for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and owners of its stock. Like every other share on this list, Broadcom is cheaper at the moment than it was just a week ago. That’s obviously an opportunity for all investors and arguably a reason to pick up AVGO shares in and of itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, I would argue that investors should pick up Broadcom because its acquisition of VMware and the finalization thereof, promises to make 2024 very strong. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware was finalized in November after much concern. Finalization of the deal was delayed three times. It’s very apparent that regulators worry about the potential of the company to become monopolistic in nature. Now that it’s been given approval and acquired VMware it should also be apparent that the company has been transformed.\n\nThat truth is reflected by the company’s guidance for the 4th quarter of a 40% increase in revenues, in part due to its VMware acquisition. The company is the leader in software infrastructure in the AI space, now has a much greater top line, and continues to pay investors a strong dividend that is growing rapidly.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominates many niches throughout the tech sector. The company carved out a spot in 2023 and into 2024 as a leader in AI. It’s hard to talk about AI stocks without mentioning Microsoft. There are dozens of reasons to potentially invest in Microsoft, AI being one of them. Here’s how I look at Microsoft in relation to artificial intelligence.\n\nOf course, OpenAI has dominated the conversation in relation to Microsoft and AI. Microsoft’s investment and integration of ChatGPT across its services was and remains the major story. Yet, Microsoft doesn’t, or hasn’t yet, benefited much from its investments on a top line basis.\n\nMicrosoft rebounded in 2023 with revenues up 13% and income increasing by 27% in the most recent earnings report. I think the increase in income is an important aspect to focus on. Microsoft has invested in applying AI to its suite of Office products which promises to increase efficiency at firms everywhere. That’s where I see the benefit of Microsoft’s AI prowess at the moment: the company helps other companies increase their efficiency thereby improving their respective bottom lines. In turn, that should increase Microsoft’s top line.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) drastically turned around in 2023 as the macroeconomic picture stabilized. Revenues are again strong across its family of apps business, which is the primary reason to invest in the company overall. Of course, interest rates are very likely to be slashed multiple times in 2024 and that again should pave the way for stronger ad revenues in the new year. In other words, there is a lot of reason for optimism around META stock currently.\n\nOne thing that arguably gets lost in the conversation surrounding Meta Platforms is just how much the company has invested in artificial intelligence. Make no mistake about it, the company has invested as much as anyone else in AI.\n\nIt’s no secret that Nvidia’s h100 chips are in high demand. However, it may come as a surprise to understand just how much of that Supply Meta Platforms procured. Nvidia sold roughly half a million of those chips during the most recent quarter. Of that, Meta and Microsoft bought roughly 60%, with 150,000 chips each.\n\nInvestors should expect the company’s Llama 2 large language model (LLM) to garner more and more attention in 2024.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA lot of times, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) gets relegated to the tier of has been in relation to chips and AI stocks. It was overtaken by AMD In late 2022 and has been playing catch up since.\n\nOne of the primary reasons to believe that Intel will be able to make headway in that regard in 2024 relates to AI and personal computers. Both Intel and AMD are releasing AI-enabled processors for the PC market in 2024. Those chips include something called a neural processing unit (NPU) which is integrated into the CPU.\n\nEssentially, NPU chips are more powerful and better suited to AI applications and promise to bring a wave of AI capability to PCs this year.\n\nThe release of those chips promises to make Intel interesting again after what was arguably a difficult 2023. During the most recent quarter, revenues slipped by 8%. Although the result was above guidance, it’s difficult to argue that declining revenues are a win. NPU chips promise to change that.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSimply put, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock continues to brim with massive potential as we move into 2024. I’d argue that as much as any other AI share, Snowflake has deep potential to provide massive returns.\n\nFew other firms are comparable to Snowflake in regard to scale and growth potential. More succinctly, SNOW is very well positioned to benefit from the resurgence of growth stocks in 2024. That resurgence will be prompted by the Federal rate cuts, which almost always galvanize growth stocks higher.\n\nSnowflake reported nearly $700 million in product revenue in the most recent quarter, rising by 34%. That’s an impressive rate of growth especially in consideration of the company’s size. Investors are well aware of the opportunity presented by the application of AI across data centers.\n\nHowever, I think some may not be aware of how much this company’s shares have fallen during this macroeconomic cycle. Shares were about well above $300 in 2021. It’s easy to argue that they have the potential to return there as the macroeconomic environment shifts back in its favor.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) approach to AI is heavily focused on training as many people as possible in artificial intelligence. Over the last few months a series of articles were written that all focus on the notion that Amazon is positioned to help prepare  the current workforce as AI evolves.\n\nThe company’s ‘AI Ready’ program aims to train 2 million people with the requisite AI skills necessary for the labor market by 2025. More information about that program can be found here. The purported benefits are expected to cut both ways: employers will get employees who are more able to adapt to the AI-dominated environments, and employees will be able to command greater salaries.\n\nIf you think about it, it’s a smart move that it could really move the needle for Amazon. The broader the net a company can cast, the better the potential returns are to the top line. Further, I think the most obvious potential of AI and the one that is nearest to fruition is the ability of AI to drastically improve efficiency of employees, not replace them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 High-Growth Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio in 2024",
        "content": "Growth stocks made a big comeback in 2023, outperforming value stocks by 31%. This is the second biggest outperformance on record (data goes back to 1979) — only 2020 saw a bigger outperformance.\n\nCan the rally in high-growth stocks continue into 2024? With the economy remaining strong, interest rates poised to move lower and a soft landing coming into view, there’s every reason to believe that growth will again outpace value in the year ahead.\n\nWhile the market’s performance has been choppy to start 2024, conditions appear to favor a continued rally in the coming months, especially with employment remaining strong and consumers continuing to spend. The first big test of the year will come when companies report their financial results for the fourth and final quarter of 2023 in coming weeks. As we wait for those results, here are seven high-growth stocks to boost your portfolio in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat a difference a day can make. After being rangebound over the past few months, shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have broken out and hit a new record high on a split adjusted basis. On Jan. 8, NVDA stock jumped 6.4% higher to finish trading at $522.53 per share. As of this writing, NVDA’s price is now in the $541 range. These new record highs were achieved after the company announced new microchips that will power artificial intelligence (AI) on personal computers (PCs).\n\nInvestors exchanged over $32 billion worth of NVDA stock on Jan. 8, making it the most traded stock on Wall Street. Previously, Nvidia’s stock had been rangebound, trading between $475 and $500 per share. The share price had been unable to break above the resistance it encountered at $500 until now. Nvidia’s stock more than tripled in 2023 and the company’s market value stands at $1.3 trillion. The new breakout begs the question: How high will NVDA stock go in 2024?\n\nStory continues\n\nFair Isaac (FICO) a pile of credit cards, credit card interest rates\n\nSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a high-growth stock that is not part of the Magnificent Seven, look to data analytics company Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO). The company responsible for everyone’s credit score saw its stock rise 95% in 2023. Over five years, FICO stock has gained 460%. The 70-year-old company behind the FICO score has seen demand for its consumer credit risk services skyrocket among customers that include banks and mortgage lenders as inflation and interest rates remain elevated.\n\nConsequently, Fair Isaac’s earnings have steadily grown. The company’s most recent print, for what was its fiscal fourth quarter, beat Wall Street forecasts across the board. Revenue totaled $389.7 million, which was up 12% from $348.7 million a year earlier. On the bottom line, the company reported net income of $101.4 million, or $4.01 per share, compared with $90.7 million, or $3.55 a share, a year earlier. With the housing market remaining strong, demand for Fair Isaac’s credit scores is expected to remain robust.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) A Bitcoin rests on top of a computer with the Coinbase (COIN) logo and a trading chart.\n\nSource: Nadezda Murmakova / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cryptocurrency market continues climbing higher, and so too does the stock of crypto exchange Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). In the last 12 months, COIN stock has risen 304%, including a 90% gain in the past six months. The rise in Coinbase Global has coincided with a stampeding bull run in cryptocurrencies, which has been led by Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) 170% increase. Sentiment towards crypto has turned positive on expectations that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are coming to the sector in the U.S.\n\nBeyond the hype related to the likely approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in America, Coinbase Global continues to grow and expand its reach around the world. In December, the company announced that it has secured a license to operate in France as it pushes further into the European market. The move into France is part of Coinbase’s global expansion strategy that the company calls “Go Deep, Go Broad.” Coinbase is also in discussions with regulators in Abu Dhabi about a potential operating license there.\n\nHonda (HMC) honda logo on a sign outside a honda dealership\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for an automaker that has been flying under the radar. Global automotive giant Honda (NYSE:HMC) has gotten little attention in the media, but has quietly outperformed most other auto stocks heading into 2024. In the last 12 months, HMC stock has risen 30%. That compares with a 7% decline in the share price of rival Ford (NYSE:F). Yet despite the strong run, Honda’s stock still looks cheap trading at only eight times 2024 earnings estimates.\n\nHonda also pays a strong quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share, giving the stock a yield of 3.24%. Looking to the year ahead, Honda has big plans for its electric vehicle (EV) sales in North America. News just broke that Honda is planning to invest $14 billion to build a new EV plant in neighboring Canada as it looks to grow its presence in North America and target the U.S. market more aggressively. HMC stock offers the benefits of good value and high-growth to investors.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother mega-cap technology stock that remains a solid bet is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). While META stock enjoyed a big run last year, the company’s shares still look affordable trading at about 30 times future earnings estimates, which is a historically low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The company’s year of efficiency has proven to be successful and the stock has gained 175% over the last 12 months. With the digital advertising market expected to rebound in 2024, there’s reason to remain bullish on the Facebook parent company.\n\nMeta Platforms is also going all-in on AI, launching last fall a new virtual reality headset and several AI applications. Hopes are high for the Quest 3 virtual reality headset that’s priced at $499 and went on sale in time for the holidays. Meta is also launching several generative AI chatbots, as well as a text-to-image platform called “Emu” that will be integrated with the Messenger app, and new AI photo editing tools for Instagram. META stock has gained 300% since bottoming in November 2022.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Investors Buy Into Chipotle's Redemption, Even if Analysts Don't\n\nIf there’s a restaurant stock likely to outperform in 2024, it is Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). The popular restaurant chain has been a high-growth stock since its market debut in 2006. During 2023, CMG stock rose an impressive 65%. Through five years, the company’s share price has risen 342%. An aggressive and consistent growth strategy and earnings outperformance are largely responsible for the strong returns to shareholders.\n\nIn its most recent earnings print, covering Q3 2023, Chipotle topped Wall Street estimates due to higher prices and brisk sales of its burritos and tacos. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $11.36 compared to $10.55 that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue amounted to $2.47 billion, which was in line with forecasts. Same-store sales rose 5%, beating estimates of 4.6%. Chipotle said it expects to open 315 new restaurants in 2024 and reiterated its forecast for same-store sales growth in high single digits.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother strong outperformer heading into 2024 is Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST). The company just reported solid holiday sales that drove its revenue up nearly 10% from a year earlier to $26.2 billion in December. The sales increase in December was double the 5% revenue increase seen in November. Same-store sales gained 8.5% from a year earlier, which was more than double the 3.5% growth seen in November. Costco reports its sales figures monthly rather than quarterly.\n\nWith discounts offered on both food and discretionary items, foot traffic at Costco’s stores increased 6.5% in the U.S. and 7.5% globally during the month of December. Gifts cards, jewelry, and gold bars remain big sellers at the company’s retail outlets. E-commerce sales at Costco also continue to thrive, fueled by discretionary purchases. E-commerce sales rose 17.7% year-over-year in December. COST stock is up 38% in the past 12 months and has gained 215% through five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and FICO.

        "title": "15 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best innovative stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our introduction to what innovation is all about and why it's the most rewarded trait on the stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nInnovation is at the heart of human progress and share price growth. Firms that find unique solutions to business problems or customer needs end up improving their operational efficiency and creating new revenue streams. This leads to more return per dollar for a shareholder than would have been possible through other investment vehicles, in a self sustaining system that requires adept managers to dot all the i's.\n\nWhen we look at some of the biggest companies in the world, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), one fact is clear. All of these companies created new manufacturing technology, platforms, products, and tools that were not present at scale in their industries.\n\nApple's example is worth a look here. Over the past decade, Apple's revenue has grown by 124%, providing its dividend shareholders with excellent value for their capital that is re-invested in the company through retained earnings. Apple had bled $1.8 billion in net losses during its fiscal years ending in the September of 1996 and 1997. Now, it's the world's most profitable non-state-owned company that generated $96.9 billion in profit during its previous fiscal year. Apple's success in the business world is attributed to its unique product design and the uncanny ability of its founder Steve Jobs to figure out key customer pain points before rival firms could catch on. The ability to design the right product and market it blends with the firm's complex supply chain that covers 50 countries and saw more than eight hundred independent assessments in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while Apple's shares and revenue are right at the top of the global food chain when it comes to innovation leading to triple digit growth, it is Tesla that is dominating the innovation space right now. The firm's revenue has grown by 826% on an absolute basis since 2010, since the market that it caters to is simply too big for Tesla to ever capture. Millions of cars roam the roads every day, and while it's easy to get an internal combustion (IC) car for low prices, a Tesla often costs tens of thousands of dollars. The lower cost market is a key Tesla objective, and its triple digit revenue growth is explained by the firm's innovation in manufacturing and mass producing a fundamentally different product in the market.\n\nWhile most companies on our list so far are mega-cap stocks, the one firm that isn't is Intel. Intel is the world's biggest processor company that designs and manufactures its own chips. This has been the case for quite some time now, and despite multiple slippages over the past decade, Intel still dominates simply due to its early found ability to double computing power every new processor generation. This ability enabled it to cement a market share right when computers were becoming powerful, and today, Intel is a corporate giant that controls the majority of x86 processor markets.\n\nLooking at these companies, it's clear that innovation is indispensable when aiming for success in the business world. Today, we'll look at which innovative companies are on hedge funds' radar and the notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 15 Best Innovative Stocks to Buy Now\n\nturtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best innovative stocks to buy, we ranked the top 30 holdings of the First Trust Innovation Leaders ETF (ILDR) by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of Q3 2023 end. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected.\n\nFor these stocks we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "Want to Beat the Average Stock Market Return? Here Are 10 Stocks to Help",
        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock market index has delivered a gain of 67,036% (including dividends) since it was established in 1957. That translates to an average annual return of 10.2%, compounded.\n\nThat's more than twice the return investors could earn if they held cash right now, even with interest rates at a 15-year high.\n\nBut, historically, investors who purchased specific individual stocks have far outperformed the return of the S&P 500. I'm going to share 10 stocks that have crushed the index since their initial public offering (IPO), and they have the potential to help you beat the market going forward, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms: 826% return since IPO\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Its stock came public in 2012, and it has since gained 826%, which translates to a compound annual return of 22.4%. That's twice the long-run average of the S&P 500.\n\nBut it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Meta stock fell 76% from peak to trough between 2021 and 2022 and then roared back to life with a 194% gain in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), the company delivered a record amount of revenue, and its net income (profit) surged 163% year over year.\n\nMeta stock is still cheap relative to the broader technology sector, and more market-beating returns might be ahead this year and beyond as the company ramps up its investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks: 1,920% return since IPO\n\nThe next market-beating stock is Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW), a world-leading cybersecurity company that came public in 2012. Its stock has soared by 1,920% since then, or by a compound annual rate of 31.4%, and it spent much of 2023 making record highs.\n\nInvestors have rewarded the company's growing investments in futuristic AI-powered cybersecurity, which are already attracting significant amounts of revenue. Palo Alto's one-year-old Cortex XSIAM product is a security operations solution designed to reduce reliance on human-led, manual incident response with the help of AI. It has already amassed $1 billion in bookings, with one large organization using it to protect 300,000 computers and devices (endpoints).\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto is on track to deliver a record-high $8.2 billion in total revenue during the current fiscal year 2024 (ending July 31, 2024). Considering that the cost of cyberattacks continues to soar, investing in one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the world might be a great move for your money going forward.\n\n3. Alphabet (Google): 6,311% return since IPO\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, but it's also home to other famous tech subsidiaries like YouTube and self-driving vehicle developer Waymo. Google stock came public in 2004 (it changed its name to Alphabet in 2015), and it has since delivered a return of 6,311%. That's equivalent to a compound annual gain of 24.5%.\n\nAdvertising dollars generated from Google Search remain Alphabet's single largest source of revenue, but a notable contribution also comes from its cloud computing platform, Google Cloud. It's growing in importance because it's where the conglomerate monetizes many of its AI initiatives, from new data center chips to large language models that form the foundation of AI software applications.\n\nLike Meta, Alphabet stock also trades at an attractive valuation compared to its big-tech peers, and that could pave the way for more upside going forward.\n\n4. Netflix: 44,146% return since IPO\n\nNext up is streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). It came public in 2002, shortly after the dot-com tech bubble burst, and its stock has delivered a red-hot gain of 44,146% since then. That translates to an annual return of 33.7%, compounded.\n\nNetflix has disrupted everything from video rental stores to cable television. Its streaming service has become the largest in the world, with 247 million paying members, and the company continues to grow its addressable market by offering cheaper subscription tiers and by expanding into new territories.\n\nNetflix is the only stand-alone streaming provider generating a profit, which bodes well for its long-term staying power compared to its peers, many of which are slashing costs right now. That could lead to more market share for Netflix over time and more gains for its stock. Image source: Netflix.\n\n5. Apple: 181,080% return since IPO\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's first $3 trillion company, and its stock has been one of the best performers in the history of the market. It has delivered a gain of 181,080% since its IPO in 1980, or a compound annual return of 19%.\n\nThe iPhone smartphone has become the company's biggest value creator, leading to other billion-dollar hardware products like the Watch and AirPods. Apple also has a booming services segment led by the subscription-based Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV. But AI might be one of the biggest reasons to own the stock going forward.\n\nThe company's iPhone 15 Pro features an Apple-designed A17 Pro chip that can process AI workloads on-device. It's reportedly working on a large language model and AI chatbot, and the ability to run such applications on the smartphone (as opposed to in the cloud) could mark a new dawn in mobile computing and pave the way for new features. It's hard to go wrong owning this tried-and-true long-term performer.\n\n6. Amazon: 193,553% return since IPO\n\nIt started out selling books online in 1994, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has transformed into one of the most diversified technology companies in the world. It came public in 1997, and its stock has soared by 193,553% since. That's a compound annual return of 33.8%, tripling the long-run average annual return of the S&P 500.\n\nE-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, but the company draws most of its profit from its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is spearheading the company's AI initiatives, from developing data center chips to helping businesses develop their own AI applications. Amazon even purchased a $4 billion stake in leading AI start-up Anthropic late last year.\n\nBut there's even more to this company. Its streaming service -- Prime -- is second only to Netflix in memberships, and its digital advertising business is one of the fastest-growing pieces of the entire company. Simply put, Amazon stock is a great way for investors to expose their portfolios to the digital economy, and it's trading at a very attractive valuation. Image source: Amazon.\n\n7. Nvidia: 196,288% return since IPO\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the star of 2023, logging a bigger gain than any other stock in the S&P 500. It has a history of spectacular growth; it came public in 1999, and since then, its stock has surged 196,288%. That translates to a 37.2% annual return, compounded.\n\nNvidia's business is currently driven by astronomical demand for its AI data center chips, specifically the H100 and upcoming H200. The world's largest data center operators have raced to give their business customers access to enough computing power to handle AI workloads so they can develop applications and integrate productivity-boosting AI into their workflows. Nvidia has a dominant market share in this area, and there are very few viable alternatives right now.\n\nIn the recent fiscal year 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's data center revenue surged by a whopping 279% year over year, to $14.5 billion. The company's Q4 forecast suggests it will end the year with a record $58.8 billion in total revenue, and Wall Street predicts it could deliver $92.2 billion in fiscal 2025. In other words, there appears to be plenty of growth left in the tank.\n\n8. Oracle: 221,826% return since IPO\n\nFounded in 1977, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is one of America's oldest technology companies. It executed its IPO in 1986, and its stock has since recorded a gain of 221,826%, translating to a compound annual return of 23.1%.\n\nOracle started out developing database management software, but today it's a leading provider of cloud-based applications designed to boost productivity in dozens of industries. Investors are intently focused on the infrastructure segment of Oracle's cloud business because the company says its Nvidia GPU chip clusters can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of other leading cloud providers.\n\nOracle has already signed up leading AI start-ups like Cohere and Elon Musk's xAI, and the company is now building 100 new data centers (on top of its existing 66) because it can't keep up with demand. Therefore, now could be a great time to buy Oracle stock ahead of what could be a growth surge in the coming years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n9. Microsoft: 504,247% return since IPO\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is nipping at Apple's heels for the title of world's most valuable company. It has a market cap of $2.7 trillion, so it isn't far away. However, Microsoft has delivered a much larger gain than Apple since its IPO in 1986 (it came public with a much smaller valuation). Microsoft stock has soared 504,247% to date, or by 25.9% compounded annually.\n\nMicrosoft still operates some of its flagship software products, like the Windows operating system and Word. But it also expanded into hardware (computers and devices), gaming, cloud computing, and AI. Last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in leading AI start-up OpenAI, which developed the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models into its Azure cloud platform, Bing search engine, 365 document suite, and Edge internet browser, among other products. It's allowing the company to successfully monetize AI already, with 18,000 businesses signed up to its Azure OpenAI Service cloud segment and tens of thousands of organizations using its AI Copilot tool for 365 in the early access program.\n\nThose AI integrations could drive the next leg of Microsoft's growth, and with its stock near an all-time high, investors certainly appear optimistic.\n\n10. Berkshire Hathaway: 3,787,464% return since IPO\n\nFinally, the stock on this list that has created the most value is Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). It's an investment company led by none other than Warren Buffett, who steered it to a 3,787,464% increase in value between 1965 (when he took the helm) and 2022.\n\nThat is a compound annual return of 19.8%, and while it's a lesser yearly gain than some other stocks I've mentioned, Berkshire's ability to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 on a consistent basis for 58 years shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nBerkshire owns a $358 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, with large positions in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. It also wholly owns private companies like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Its diverse exposure to so many different industries has been the secret sauce to its consistent returns over such a long period of time.\n\nIf you're looking for a stock with a solid track record of crushing the S&P 500, then look no further.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Down 40% from Highs, Is TTD Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "While the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index (NDX) surged over 40% in 2023, there are several tech stocks trading significantly below all-time highs. The rally in 2023 was primarily driven by large-cap companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Meanwhile, shares of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) are currently trading 40% below all-time highs, valuing the company at $33.6 billion.\n\nDespite the pullback in the last two years, TTD stock has returned over 2,280% to investors since its initial public offering in September 2016, but can the tech stock replicate these gains in the future?\n\nI am bullish on TTD stock, as the company is part of a rapidly expanding market, allowing it to grow revenue and profit margins at a comfortable pace in the upcoming decade, which should translate to outsized gains for shareholders. Let’s see why.\n\nAn Overview of The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk offers an enterprise-facing demand-side digital platform allowing companies to better optimize their online marketing campaigns. TTD’s portfolio of tools and solutions leverages the power of data, allowing customers to reach a wide range of audiences at a lower cost.\n\nA global technology company, TTD empowers the buyers of digital ads. Using its cloud-based platform, ad buyers can create, manage, and optimize data-driven digital ad campaigns across formats and channels, including video, connected TV (CTV), audio, display, and social.\n\nTTD’s platform boasts seamless integration with key inventory, publisher, and data partners, providing ad buyers with reach while improving decision-making capabilities. Its client base includes ad agencies, brands, and other ad-oriented service providers.\n\nTTD enters into master service agreements with its customers and generates revenue by charging them a platform fee based on total ad spend. Additionally, it drives sales through data services and other advanced platform functionalities.\n\nStory continues\n\nTTD: Positioned for Growth\n\nThe Trade Desk is well poised to benefit from the growing digitization of media and a fragmented audience base, which has increased the complexity of advertising in the past decade, leading to demand for an automated ad-buying process.\n\nTTD aims to increase enterprise demand by developing the programmatic capabilities of its platform and ad inventory. It believes the growth of the programmatic ad market is essential for top-line growth, while the widespread adoption of these services allows the company to acquire new clients and increase spending from existing ones.\n\nIn its quarterly filing, TTD explained, “Although our clients include some of the largest advertising agencies in the world, we believe there is significant room for us to expand further within these clients and gain a larger amount of their advertising spend through our platform.”\n\nA report from Market Research Future estimates the programmatic ad market to grow from $56.28 billion in 2022 to $138.25 billion in 2030, indicating an annual growth rate of 13.7% in this period.\n\nTTD ended 2022 with sales of $1.58 billion, suggesting it had a market share of 2.8%. If the company can raise its market share to 5% in the next few years, it might end 2030 with sales of almost $7 billion.\n\nThe Trade Desk expects the adoption of programmatic advertising by inventory owners and content providers to expand the volume and type of ad inventory for its clients. For example, it has expanded its CTV, native, and audio ad offerings via integrations with supply-side partners.\n\nThe gross spending on The Trade Desk has risen from $552 million in 2015 to $7.74 billion in 2022, allowing the company to increase sales from $114 million to $1.58 billion in this period.\n\nHow Did the Trade Desk Perform in Q3 2023?\n\nIn Q3 2023, The Trade Desk reported revenue of $493.3 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Programmatic ad platforms such as TTD continue to grow at an enviable pace as advertisers are ready to pay a premium for precision and transparency while maximizing returns from their campaigns.\n\nTTD ended Q3 with a customer retention rate of 95%, a rate it has maintained for the last nine years.\n\nWith an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) margin of 40%, TTD expanded its adjusted earnings by 27% year-over-year to $0.33 per share in Q3.\n\nIs TTD Stock Undervalued or Overvalued?\n\nAnalysts tracking TTD expect sales to rise by 21.9% to $1.92 billion for Fiscal 2023 and by 20.5% to $2.32 billion this year. Its adjusted earnings are forecast to rise from $1.04 per share in 2022 to $1.27 per share for Fiscal 2023 and $1.43 per share for Fiscal 2024.\n\nSo, priced at 54.3x forward earnings, TTD stock trades at a lofty valuation, especially since the sector’s multiple is much lower at 15.7x.\n\nIs TTD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOut of the 20 analysts covering TTD stock, 19 recommend a Buy, one recommends a Hold, and none recommend a Sell. The average TTD stock price target is $82.69, 20.8% above the current price.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe Trade Desk is a high-growth company that commands a premium valuation. Still, it’s part of an expanding addressable market, providing it with enough room to grow its revenue, earnings, and cash flows in 2024 and beyond. The secular shift towards CTV advertising in key markets should also act as a positive catalyst for TTD, making it a top investment choice right now.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "7 S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy to Keep the Bull Market Running",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is within striking distance of entering official bull market territory. To qualify, the index would need to rise more than 20% from its previous low and hit a new all-time high. The popular benchmark crossed the first threshold and needs to close above 4,796.56 to achieve the second. It’s within about 75 points of making it and there’s good reason to think it could happen soon.\n\nBear markets are relatively short-term events lasting about 15 months on average. Bull markets, on the other hand, are measured in years and typically run for around 36 months. The S&P 500 bottomed out on October 12, 2022 and the broad-based index has largely been running higher since.\n\nNow that we’re this close to hitting the mark, here are seven S&P 500 stocks that can keep this bull market run going.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not only the world’s largest technology company but with a $2.8 trillion market capitalization, it is the largest company period. It has a 7.4% weight in the S&P 500. Yet shares are down 8% since the middle of December as slowing sales and profit growth weighed on performance.\n\nThe centerpiece of its business is the iPhone, which accounts for 52% of total sales. Revenue hit a new record in the fourth quarter but growth was a paltry 2.8%. For the full year, revenue was actually down 2.4%. All other Apple products such as Macs, iPads and wearables, were also lower from the year-ago period.\n\nSo why will Apple keep growing? Services continue to light up sales growth. Revenue jumped 16% in the fourth quarter, an acceleration from previous periods. Although it’s about half the size of the iPhone segment, it’s going to eventually become Apple’s biggest business. From the App Store to Apple Music, Apple Pay to iCloud, Apple is pulling in money left and right. It’s also hugely profitable.\n\nWhere product gross margins were north of 32%, service gross margins were 70.9%, up 40 basis points sequentially. Apple’s massive installed base of products ensures services revenue will keep growing. There will be hiccups in the tech giant’s performance from time to time but the overall trend is up. Apple is a key driver for keeping this bull market going.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) The Alphabet (GOOG GOOGL) logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nBest known as the parent company of search engine Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also the world’s largest online advertising platform. Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, Google Cloud, and other products and services all contribute to propping up the ad business. Alphabet generated $59.6 billion in ad revenue in just the third quarter of 2023 or 78% of the total.\n\nSearch naturally is the primary driver of revenue, representing 74% of total sales. There had been concern that companies dependent on online advertising would get hit by a recession as businesses reined in spending. While that’s likely true for smaller outfits, businesses also know that if they want to reach consumers they need to be on Alphabet’s platforms. It is facing competition from other ad outlets, including Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Facebook, but Google is still the dominant player in the space. It still owns 85% of the global search market.\n\nYet the future for Alphabet is much more than search. Google Cloud is the third largest cloud services platform, Android has a 70% share of the mobile market, Gmail is the de facto email service, and so forth. Alphabet also promises to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI). It claims its generative AI model Gemini is the “largest, most capable and most general” AI system. The Pixel 8 Pro smartphone is the first smartphone to be powered by AI. Expect Alphabet to be front and center in the bull market.\n\nPaycom Software (PAYC)\n\nSource: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cloud-based payroll company, Paycom Software (NASDAQ:PAYC) provides payroll, talent acquisition, time and labor management, and other business solutions. But after racing higher across the first half of 2023, Paycom stock fell off the table. From peak to trough it lost over 60% of its value in just three months. Now it’s climbing higher once more.\n\nPaycom’s Beti software is a paradigm shift in how payroll services are performed. Employees themselves do their own payroll helping to eliminate errors. It’s proving so popular that two-thirds of Paycom’s customers have switched to Beti. Third-quarter revenue was up 22% year over year as customers realized they were saving money from “perfect” payrolls.\n\nThe one problem is that businesses are becoming so efficient and proficient at using Beti they are eliminating certain billable items. That’s hurting Payocm’s growth rate at the moment, and led to disappointing guidance for the rest of 2023 and 2024. However, it should make for satisfied customers who return again and again in the future.\n\nPaycom’s financial foundation remains solid and the modest dividend it initiated last year remains secure. There is plenty of room for future growth from the payout. Particularly as the market picks up steam, the cloud-based payroll company should thrive.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity specialist Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) enjoys the peace of mind that comes from knowing your business will always be needed. Data breaches were expected to hit a record last year and will likely continue being a menace going forward. Fortinet’s enterprise-class, service-provider and government-organization clients can also be at ease with its network security, cloud security, and endpoint security services. Its Security Fabric platform for example, enables customers to achieve higher levels of security, performance, and efficiency while reducing complexity and costs.\n\nAI is also expected to play a large role in protecting against cyber threats. Fortinet invested heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities to enhance its threat detection, prevention, and response solutions. It also staked out a leadership position in firewalls and software-defined wide area networks, or SD-WANs, that connect data centers to branches and the cloud.\n\nAs more customers shift their data and operations to the cloud, the need for security increases, not lessens. By expanding its product portfolio to meet customer demand, Fortinet can further increase its market share while revenue and profits grow.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) Deck of a Royal Caribbean (RCL) cruise ship looking over the ocean\n\nSource: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter nearly capsizing four years ago in the wake of the pandemic, Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL) is back sailing the high seas. Shares more than doubled over the past year, far outstripping the returns of the index. Revenue is at record levels and the cruise line operator boasts occupancy rates comparable to pre-Covid levels despite prices rising.\n\nDespite this, Royal Caribbean trades at just 13 times earnings estimates and just 13 times free cash flow. It is more heavily indebted than it was before the global health crisis four years ago, but that was necessary to stay afloat. It is back to earning plenty of profit and generating cash flow to pay that down.\n\nThat’s not to say it might now encounter a rogue wave or two. The conflict in Israel will likely cause a small hit to its performance. The cruise line noted 1.5% of its fourth quarter capacity was to Israel. However, many of those voyages have been diverted elsewhere. The recent Red Sea attacks by Yemeni militants attacking ships could make travel there too dangerous as well. Commercial ships are already rerouting from the area. Cruise ports of call in Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia may be off-limits. Even so, Royal Caribbean is still going full steam ahead and should keep sailing on.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is another cybersecurity specialist performing even better than Fortinet. Its stock is up 115% in the last 12 months. The industry is expected to grow from $156 billion in 2022 to $425 billion in 2030 for a near-14% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nThe cybersecurity leader’s fiscal year 2023 revenue soared 25% to $6.9 billion and turned in a $440 million profit. That’s a complete reversal from the year-ago period when it suffered losses of $267 million. It’s continuing that strong growth in fiscal 2024 with fourth quarter revenue up 20% while profits grew nearly 10-fold. Chairman and CEO ​​Nikesh Arora says the performance was driven by “An unprecedented level of attacks is fueling strong demand in the cybersecurity market.”\n\nIt is also investing in AI-powered solutions. Its Cortex platform now has 5,300 customers, a 25% increase in the quarter. It was also the only platform to achieve a 100% detection and protection in comprehensive industry evaluations called MITRE 5.\n\nBecause like death and taxes, cybercrime will always be with us, Palo Alto Networks will keep driving the bull market forward.\n\nModerna (MRNA) Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is currently best known for its Spikevax Covid therapeutic. But the biotech also delivers treatments for various other diseases, such as cancer and rare genetic disorders. While Covid shots are a much harder sell these days, Moderna has a 48% share of the U.S. market. It did have $6.7 billion worth of Covid product sales last year, however. Now it is preparing to launch another product, a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. There are nine other late-stage programs in development.\n\nThat gives Moderna the confidence to predict it will return to organic sales growth in 2025. It also expects to break even in 2026.  It says product launches and disciplined investment will help sales steadily grow going forward as it launches as many as 15 new products over the next five years. One of the more promising developments is its personalized cancer vaccine mRNA-4157, which it is collaborating with Merck (NYSE:MRK) on.\n\nModerna’s stock was a laggard in 2023 as Covid-related Spikevax sales collapsed 71%. As that’s it’s only commercial product on the market it’s not surprising the stock tumbled hard. Yet its RSV vaccine is moving towards commercialization in early 2024 and its other therapies are progressing through trials. The market is warming up to the stock once again. Expect Moderna to keep growing as more products hit the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) stock increased significantly by 11% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n\n21% = US$30b ÷ US$143b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.21.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Meta Platforms' Earnings Growth And 21% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Meta Platforms seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Meta Platforms' decent 8.9% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nWe then compared Meta Platforms' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.2% in the same 5-year period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for META? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Meta Platforms Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nMeta Platforms doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Meta Platforms' performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

        "title": "Forget Apple: 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks led the market in 2023, and many believe they will do it again in 2024. This cohort, headlined by the big tech stars, includes:\n\nApple Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Microsoft Nvidia Tesla\n\nApple is one of the most prominent companies within this group, especially with its consumer-facing products. It's also the world's largest company, valued at $2.87 trillion (compared to Microsoft's $2.75 trillion).\n\nHowever, I don't think it's worth the investment right now, especially when this group has three better stocks to choose from.\n\nWhy is Apple a poor investment now?\n\nYears ago, Apple's stock was reasonably valued. Now, it's not. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nApple's stock trades for around 30 times earnings -- a level reserved for perfectly executing companies growing at an above-market pace. While it's hard to dispute Apple's execution, its revenue shrank every quarter in 2023.\n\nAs a result, Apple has a long way to go to earn its valuation. However, three stocks within the Magnificent Seven are cheaper and growing faster than Apple, making them superior investments for 2024.\n\nThese investments are better and cheaper than Apple stock\n\nOf the remaining six, I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms make for stronger buys.\n\nWhile Alphabet and Meta have other investments and businesses, they are primarily advertising businesses. In late 2022 and early 2023, this industry struggled. However, in Q3, they lapped those comparisons, which allowed their ad divisions to grow much faster than in previous quarters (Meta's ad revenue grew 24% to $33.6 billion, and Alphabet's rose 9.4% to $59.6 billion).\n\nThe same tailwinds that boosted these two in Q3 will prevail throughout Q4 and 2024, setting them up for a strong year.\n\nAmazon also has an ad division, but it didn't experience the same weakness as the other two because its ad segment is relatively new (at least compared to Meta and Alphabet). However, the rise of ads and other high-margin segments marks the transition of Amazon from solely an e-commerce business to one with vital services. As a result, Amazon's gross margins have substantially risen over the past decade with AWS (its cloud computing division), ad services, subscriptions, and third-party seller services.\n\nStory continues AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHigh gross margins allow for better profit margins, which have also risen alongside its gross margin. This paints an optimal picture for Amazon, as it is finally turning the corner to become a consistently profitable business.\n\nThis is something investors haven't experienced before, making 2024 an exciting year for Amazon.\n\nWith these three, there is a lot of excitement and buzz about what 2024 could be. With Apple, the consensus is: \"I hope the iPhone weakness doesn't get worse.\" I prefer to invest in more optimistic companies, making these three no-brainers compared to Apple.\n\nThey're also priced a lot more competitively. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFrom a forward-looking perspective, Meta and Alphabet are far cheaper than Apple. Historically, these two have traded around the same range as Apple, which means their stocks are slated for strong growth in 2024.\n\nAmazon is much harder to compare because it's in an entirely different business and hasn't had a full year of optimized profits. However, if you consider analyst revenue estimates for Amazon's 2024 fiscal year, and if the company can pull off an 8.5% profit margin for the entire year, it will produce nearly $50 billion in profits. With Amazon's current market cap, that would price the stock at 31 times 2024 earnings, which is still more expensive than Apple's valuation.\n\nHowever, that's a short-term view, as Amazon is just starting its optimization journey. As a result, I still think Amazon will outperform Apple by a wide margin over the next few years and could increase its profit margin even more.\n\nApple may have been the stock to own over the past decade, but there are much better options now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Q3 Earnings Roundup: Meta (NASDAQ:META) And The Rest Of The Social Networking Segment\n\nQuarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company’s progress, especially compared to other peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Meta (NASDAQ:META), and the best and worst performers in the social networking group.\n\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nThe 4 social networking stocks we track reported a mixed Q3; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 2.8% while next quarter's revenue guidance was in line with consensus. Stocks have faced challenges as investors prioritize near-term cash flows, but social networking stocks held their ground better than others, with the share prices up 35.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META)\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Facebook Reality Labs.\n\nMeta reported revenues of $34.15 billion, up 23.2% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 2%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter. On the other hand, Meta beat analysts' revenue and EPS estimates this quarter, driven by better-than-expected monthly active user growth.\n\n\"We had a good quarter for our community and business,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. Meta Total Revenue\n\nMeta achieved the fastest revenue growth of the whole group. The company reported 3.96 billion monthly active users, up 6.7% year on year.

It was a strong quarter for the company, with a beat of analysts' revenue estimates and solid growth in its user base. Snap Total Revenue\n\nSnap scored the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The company reported 406 million daily active users, up 11.8% year on year.

        "title": "Why I Sold Some Apple Stock to End 2023 and Where I'm Investing Instead",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks prized for growth and earnings stability, helped propel the overall stock market back toward all-time highs in 2023.\n\nApple's performance was rock solid despite higher interest rates and a resulting weakening of global consumer spending. When accounting for reinvested dividends, Apple stock's total return was an incredible 45% in 2023.\n\nThough I favor making small, gradual portfolio changes over time, I decided to sell some Apple stock near the end of 2023. Here's why and where I invested instead.\n\nThe most \"expensive\" magnificent seven stock?\n\nThrough thick and thin, I've owned Apple for many years. 2023 was an interesting year. Despite being part of the vaunted group of Magnificent Seven tech giants (thanks to the aforementioned stock price outperformance), it was actually far from a perfect year for Apple.\n\nThe iPhone remains far and away the flagship product, accounting for 52% of the company's $383 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 (which ended in September). But as I wrote in November, even iPhone sales fell slightly. Paired with a steep drop in the PC (primarily the MacBook for Apple) and other consumer electronics markets (e.g., iPad, Watch, AirPods, Beats), not even the ongoing growth in Services was enough to keep Apple revenue on the rise.\n\nApple was able to offset this weakness with ample share repurchases. It repurchased and retired $77.6 billion worth of stock, effectively reducing its share count by 3% last year and boosting earnings per share for shareholders.\n\nThat was a great strategy for investors during the bear market over the last couple of years, and my over-allocation to Apple helped keep my portfolio afloat. However, slow growth and stock buybacks may not be the best strategies if you believe (as I do) a new bull market might be in the early innings.\n\nApple stock looks expensive, given the sluggish earnings growth expected for 2024. In fact, of all the Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple has the lowest long-term earnings growth rate (9% expected), yet trades for a premium 28 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for next year's earnings.\n\nStory continues AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis is why I sold some Apple to redeploy the proceeds elsewhere. That said, I still have plenty of Apple stock. That now comes primarily via my old index fund investments in Vanguard Growth ETF (of which Apple is about 13% of the portfolio), Vanguard Information Technology ETF (22% of the portfolio), and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (nearly 50% of Berkshire's publicly traded stock holdings).\n\nNevertheless, with Apple maturing into a slower-growth business, and given that I have decades left before I need my investment dollars, I felt it necessary to trim and rebalance.\n\nWhere I'm investing my Apple winnings\n\nWhen looking for a replacement for my portfolio rebalance, I started with the Magnificent Seven themselves. I already purchased additional Alphabet last year. However, the other two parts of the big digital advertising market -- Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- still look attractively priced for an expected rally in earnings in 2024. I've been building up a larger position in Amazon as it figures out how better to monetize its massive e-commerce and digital consumer empire. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAfter an epic year for the buildout of generative AI infrastructure (mostly to Nvidia's gain), I think beaten-up software stocks could benefit in 2024 as all that newly installed AI hardware starts to get monetized. I added to a longtime position in Salesforce(NYSE: CRM) again and am looking to finally start buying ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW) sometime this year. Other cloud computing stocks look compelling for the new year as well.\n\nAnd, of course, I still like semiconductor stocks, too, especially if the iPhone and other consumer electronic sales notch a rebound in 2024.\n\nTo be clear, Apple looks like it has all the ingredients to continue as a great long-term investment. Growth may be more moderate than in times past, but the tech titan is highly profitable and doles out ample cash to shareholders. I'm happy to continue holding, but a high valuation compared to some other tech stocks makes me think there are better growth opportunities available right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Let’s face it – not everyone wants to research individual stocks. That’s why index-tracking exchange traded funds can be so useful. Among the most popular ETFs is the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), which includes some of the best-known names in technology. Is QQQ stock right for you, though?\n\nIt probably deserves a place in your portfolio, even if you’re an experienced stock picker. The Invesco QQQ ETF, which is managed by Georgia-based fund manager Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), has something to offer to a broad variety of investors. So, let’s crack open this famous fund and see what’s inside.\n\nQQQ Stock: Cheap, Easy and Hard to Beat\n\nWhether you already picked out some technology stocks or not, you can get easy, immediate exposure to some of 2023’s biggest winners with QQQ stock. Furthermore, you can let Invesco’s fund managers do the heavy lifting for a very reasonable fee.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, the total annual expense ratio for the Invesco QQQ ETF is just 0.2%. Compared to the expense ratios of some other funds out there on the market, 0.2% is fairly cheap.\n\nJust to recap, QQQ stock tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. But here’s a fun fact: The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 actually has 101 holdings. Still, it does a good job of tracking (i.e., following) the Nasdaq 100 index, which is technology-sector-dominated and weighted by market capitalization.\n\nAnd by the way, passive income investors should be interested to know that the Invesco QQQ ETF has a 12-month distribution rate (dividend yield plus interest payments) of 0.62%. That’s in addition to the share-price appreciation, which was considerable in 2023. Impressively, the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 share price increased by around 54% last year.\n\nDon’t Fight the Fed! Just Buy the Invesco QQQ ETF.\n\nMoreover, QQQ stock includes some “Magnificent Seven” names that performed exceptionally well in 2023. Here are a few of them, along with their share-price increases from last year:\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA): Up 239% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META): Up 194% Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA): Up 102% Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): Up 81%\n\nThus, you were in the winner’s circle in 2023 if you just held the Invesco QQQ ETF all year long. This year’s best tech-sector performers might be different, but with Invesco’s diversified Nasdaq-100-tracking ETF, you don’t have to play the difficult game of picking and predicting.\n\nBesides, technology stocks tend to perform well when U.S. monetary policy is easing. That will likely occur in 2024, as the market expects the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates multiple times. This would reduce borrowing costs, and should provide a favorable growth environment for companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms.\n\nCatch the Wave of Momentum With QQQ Stock\n\nWhich famous technology stocks will be 2024’s biggest winners? Put away your crystal ball, as you don’t need to pick and predict if you own some QQQ stock.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll certainly want to have some well-known tech names in your portfolio when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. So, whether or not you’re a seasoned stock picker, keep some shares of the Invesco QQQ ETF for the rest of 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the 13 most advanced countries in electronics. You can skip our detailed analysis of the electronics industry and go directly to the 5 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics.\n\nLiving in a technological era, we are constantly surrounded by one or the other form of electronics. Most of us carry one or another form of electronics everywhere we go, short of bushcrafting in the woods, but you'll most likely still take your phone along there too. All these instruments, including smartphones, smart watches, airpods, tabs and PCs, along with others, are the various types of electronics without which, civilization, as we know it, would not exist.\n\nFurthermore, the industry of electronics is continuously evolving and bringing to the forefront innovative products aimed at facilitating a more efficient lifestyle. For the year 2024, it is expected that the electronics industry would show a trend towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well as organic electronics, apart from many more. We have already emphasized the far-reaching role of specialized chips for this sector in the article 12 most advanced countries in electronics. Here we present to you the significance of organic electronics and AI in general.\n\nOrganic Electronics\n\nThe rising global warming and climatic disruption witnessed by the world has encouraged a more environmental friendly attitude. The electronics industry is no different. In an attempt to play their part, sustainable and eco-friendly devices are not only becoming their priority but have also been forecasted as the future of electronics industry. As a means of producing next-generation electronic devices, organic electronics are poised for an accelerated future growth. The global organic electronics market is expected to generate $178.25 billion by 2028.\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) shows full commitment towards sustainability and green initiatives. Cisco Takeback and Reuse, for one, is an effort to support circular economy by efficiently managing end-of-life of returned equipment and enhancing recycling and reuse rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithin this field of organic electronics, OLED technologies are expected to shine the most. Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ: OLED), collaborating with PPG, have recently opened an OLED site- organic light emitting diode- in Shannon, Ireland. This will not only give a boost to the global organic market but to make a substantial contribution to the sustainability agenda of the electronics industry.\n\nSimilarly, LG Display (NYSE: LPL) is also in the running for using organic electronics to produce more efficient and user- friendly devices. Their third generation OLED TV panels is one such example. These TV panels are the lowest blue light for now, which makes them more suitable for eye comfort.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nIn almost any field, be that business, medicine or engineering, AI has revolutionized the concept of efficiency. The electronics market has not only grasped the relevance of this technology for current applications but also for the exponential impacts that can be garnered in future technological progress. It is expected that the AI demand would increase by about 40% in the course of five years. Hence, it is not surprising that various electronic companies are continuously upgrading their products and investments in the arena. While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), have already infiltrated the generative AL software market with powerful computer chips like H100 and MI300X respectively, Intel (NASDAQ: INTL) has also ventured forth with new chips including Gaudi3.\n\nSimilarly, IBM (NYSE: IBM) are also in touch with the necessity of upgrading their AI systems. To this end, only this year they have a new data science platform- Watsonx. It is supposed to provide tools for building and organizing AI and arranging all data sources under one platform.\n\nFuture Forecast\n\nAs evidenced in almost all industries, the COVID-19 pandemic had volatile repercussions for consumers and businesses alike. The electronics industry was, thus one of the victims. Lock-downs and closures negatively impacted electronics sales. However, the work from home trend led to a reversal of the situations, increasing demand for items like computers etc.\n\nIn 2022, the global consumer electronics market was valued at $738.75 billion and it is predicted that this figure would change to $1,239.40 billion by the end of 2030. User-friendly Smart devices are likely to lie at the crux of growth amid increasing household sector and governmental support. While the Asian region has produced most electronics manufacturers, Europeans are also in the race to catch up. Below we present a list of the most advanced countries in electronics. 13 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics\n\nHigh angle view of a semiconductor chip against an array of electronics components.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most advanced countries in electronics, we’ve ranked them based on their electronics-manufacturing infrastructure, technology and research institutes. For this purpose, we’ve gathered data from various sources, including an FDI Intelligence report that evaluated countries’ locations for the quality of R&D in electronics based on infrastructure, talent availability and business environment. We’ve also accounted for the top electronics companies in these countries. After that, we scored each country in their advancement in electronics given all these factors and ranked them in ascending order of advancement.\n\nHere are the 13 most advanced countries in electronics, which are also some of the most technologically advanced nations.\n\n13. Denmark\n\nDenmark is considered as one of the most advanced electronic countries.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Despite economic uncertainty, Wall Street delivered phenomenal returns to patient investors in 2023. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite rallied 24% and 43%, respectively, by the time the curtain closed.\n\nAlthough the rally became a bit more broad-based in the final two months of the year, the outperformance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is widely credited with lifting the broader market higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to what have consistently been the seven largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. by market cap:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nApple clocked in as the \"worst\" of the bunch with a 48% return in 2023, while Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia rallied 102%, 194%, and 239%, respectively. AAPL Chart\n\nWhat investors seem to appreciate about the Magnificent Seven stocks is their undeniable competitive advantages.\n\nApple's iPhone is responsible for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share, and its share repurchase program is unmatched by other public companies. Microsoft's Windows is still the undisputed leader in desktop operating systems, while Azure has gobbled up a 25% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Alphabet's Google accounted for close to 92% of worldwide internet search share in December. Meanwhile, streaming platform YouTube (also owned by Alphabet) attracts more than 2.7 billion unique viewers each month. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brings in an estimated 40% of U.S. online retail sales, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) leading the world in cloud infrastructure service spending share (31%), as of the third quarter. Nvidia is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nvidia may account for more than 90% of all graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers in 2024. Meta Platforms owns the world's top social media \"real estate.\" Facebook is the most-visited site globally, with WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger collectively (with Facebook) attracting close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's comfortably reached recurring profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn spite of these competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven stocks could differ dramatically in the new year. Whereas one Magnificent Seven stock is effectively cheaper than it's ever been as a publicly traded company, another expensive highflier appears poised for a reality check.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in 2024: Amazon\n\nAmong the seven industry titans listed above, the one investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024, and likely hold for many years to come, is e-commerce company Amazon.\n\nThe biggest potential headwind for Amazon in the new year is the possibility of a U.S. recession taking shape. A couple of money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggest a downturn is likely. Since Amazon generates so much of its revenue from its online marketplace, a recession would be expected to slow consumer spending.\n\nBut there are two important things to understand about this headwind for Amazon. First, recessions are historically short-lived. Only three of 12 U.S. recessions following World War II have surpassed 12 months, and none have made it past 18 months. Betting on economic expansion has always been a winning move for patient investors.\n\nSecondly, but most important, Amazon generates very little of its operating cash flow and operating income from its mammoth online marketplace. Even if online retail sales were to taper a bit, it would likely have a negligible impact on the company's cash flow and bottom line.\n\nWhat can carry Amazon's stock to new highs in 2024 is the company's high-growth ancillary operating segments, which are led by AWS.\n\nAs noted, AWS accounts for nearly a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending. Cloud service margins can run circles around the razor-thin margins associated with online retail sales. As a result, AWS is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income despite generating only a sixth of the company's net sales. With enterprise cloud-service spending still ramping up, AWS looks to have a long runway of double-digit growth ahead of it.\n\nDon't overlook Amazon's advertising services segment, either. This is a company that's drawing more than 2 billion people to its site on a monthly basis, many of which are motivated shoppers. This puts the ball in Amazon's court when it comes to ad-pricing power. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered at least 21% year-over-year constant-currency sales growth over the past eight quarters (two years).\n\nAlthough some fundamentally focused investors are going to be turned off by Amazon's astronomical trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 75, the traditional P/E ratio is a terrible way to value cutting-edge companies like Amazon that are reinvesting the bulk of their operating cash flow back into their business. Valuing Amazon relative to its cash flow is, therefore, a much smarter approach.\n\nThroughout the 2010s, Amazon was regularly valued at a multiple of 23 to 37 times cash flow. It can be scooped up right now for less than 13 times forecast cash flow in 2024. With the exception of the 2022 bear market, it's the cheapest Amazon has traded, relative to its future cash flow, since going public in 1997. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Nvidia\n\nOn the other side of the coin, semiconductor giant Nvidia has all the hallmarks of a stock to avoid like the plague in 2024.\n\nI'll absolutely give Nvidia credit where credit is due for more than tripling in value last year. With interest in AI soaring, Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs quickly became staples in AI-accelerated data centers. Considering that chip fabrication juggernaut Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is significantly beefing up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia shouldn't have any trouble delivering more of its AI-driven GPUs in the quarters to come.\n\nSo, what's the problem? Pricing power, growing competition, regulatory headwinds, and history all come to mind.\n\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ends later this month, the company's sales are expected to climb by approximately 119% from the previous year. Almost the entirety of this growth can be traced to the company's GPUs from its data-center segment. More specifically, it's being driven by jaw-dropping pricing power.\n\nThrough the first six months of fiscal 2024, Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined from the prior-year period. Through the first nine months, it's only jumped by an aggregate of 20%. What this tells investors is that A100 and H100 scarcity is what's driven Nvidia's sales growth. Ironically, ramping up its own production in the current calendar year is liable to sap its pricing power and adversely impact its gross margin.\n\nTo build on this point, competition in AI-focused GPUs is bound to pick up. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to roll it out in a big way throughout 2024. Likewise, Intel plans to bring its Falcon Shores GPU to market as a direct competitor to Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips in 2025. This should provide further downside pressure on Nvidia's pricing power.\n\nRegulators are doing Nvidia no favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have imposed restrictions on AI-GPU exports to China. This is a potentially big blow to Nvidia, which regularly generates between 20% and 25% of its sales from the world's No. 2 global economy by gross domestic product.\n\nLastly, history could be Nvidia's worst enemy in the new year. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years that's avoided an initial bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have a tendency to overestimate the adoption/uptake of new innovations without giving them the proper time to mature. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to the rule, which could sink Nvidia's proverbial ship in 2024.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Augmented reality stocks are a signal of innovation in our ever changing technological world, offering an insight into the future. This industry which is sometimes associated with companies focused on virtual reality completely changes the way we interact with technology. Informally known as AV stocks, they span a spectrum of possibilities, from enhancing consumer experiences to revolutionizing worker training.\n\nVR products are no longer confined to gaming and entertainment. They are cutting themselves a niche in many fields, making what was once science fiction, a reality. Together, AV and VR stocks are more than just technical investments; they represent visions, foresight and anticipation beyond traditional technological bounds. Given our position at this technological point, it is clear that investing in augmented reality stocks is more than a savvy financial game. It is a jump into the future of untapped potential and endless possibilities and opportunities.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent dive into augmented and virtual reality markets heralds a pivotal shift, potentially rejuvenating these sectors. It introduced the Apple Vision Pro, a high-tech combination of AR and VR. This hardware is promising to fit into daily activities just as easily as the iPhone has managed to do. It is largely a VR headset, augmented with AR through peripheral cameras. It will debut early next year at a price of $3,499.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, Apple’s robust services revenue trajectory could escalate with the AR device. This innovation might bolster subscription growth by enriching fitness and video content with AR. The advent of metaverse-related services, like AR apps, hints at a revenue composition shift, possibly eclipsing iPhone sales within five years.\n\nIn stock market terms, Apple’s venture could be transformative, shaping investor perspectives and impacting stock performance. This involvement in a burgeoning sector is also instrumental in its future growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), famous for the manufacturing of mobile chipsets, is now approaching the markets for augmented and virtual reality. Originally known for its popularity in terms of mobile technology, Qualcomm also has a role to play in AR and VR chipset development. Its Snapdragon 835 and 845 chipsets are crucial in the VR industry, leading to advanced stand-alone VR headsets. The Snapdragon XR1 platform, a pioneer in extended reality, supports interactive controls and high-resolution video.\n\nOn a financial note, Qualcomm’s XR income from its IoT department is also on the rise, The development denotes the growth of the AR and VR market. The company’s strong position in the tech industry and partnerships, such as supplying RF chips to Apple, support its position in the industry. Its foray into VR glasses lands it as a major contender against top-tier products and confirms its tech presence.\n\nAs a result, Qualcomm’s involvement in AR and VR technologies pinpoints it as one of the main players among augmented and virtual reality stocks. Its attention to these changing technologies is an indicator of a bright future for these rapidly emerging fields.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is making significant inroads in augmented and virtual reality marketplaces. It is modifying how the metaverse functions to make it more user-friendly. This method allows individuals to have fun, study and converse in a fictitious setting. The company’s innovative strategy has increased daily active users, boosting its performance in AV, VR and AR prospects. In the third quarter of 2023, the platform reported 70 million daily active users worldwide.\n\nIn comparison to its peers like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Unity Software (NYSE:U), Roblox presents a unique investment profile. Meta Platforms delves into VR and AR products through its Reality Labs. Meanwhile, Unity Software champions the creation of 3D interactive environments. This diversity underscores the broad spectrum of opportunities within the VR and AR sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, Roblox’s trajectory in the VR and AR scene demonstrates the importance of its role in designing virtual experiences. Roblox positions itself to preserve its role as a significant participant as VR and AR technology progresses. Its importance in the business is not a passing fad, but rather evidence of its long-term significance.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Thinking about buying stocks as the new year begins? You might want to press the pause button.\n\nNo, I'm not recommending that you avoid the stock market altogether. That could prove to be a mistake over the long term. However, Warren Buffett has some words of wisdom that I think every investor should heed. Take Buffett's advice: Don't buy any stock in 2024 unless it passes this straightforward test. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe Buffett test\n\nIn Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) shareholders released in 2014, he explained a test that he and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger applied before buying any stock. Munger passed away in November 2023, but it's a safe bet that Buffett will still employ this same process in 2024.\n\nThere are two steps to Buffett's test:\n\nDetermine if you can \"sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out or more.\" If the answer to the first step is yes, buy the stock only if its price is reasonable compared to the lower end of the estimated earnings range.\n\nYou might wonder if Buffett sometimes bends the rules. For example, would he still buy a stock if it passed the test but the overall economic picture looked uncertain? Would he buy the stock if Wall Street hated it? The answer is a resounding \"yes.\" He wrote to Berkshire shareholders nearly a decade ago:\n\nIn the 54 years we [he and Munger] have worked together, we have never foregone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment, or the views of other people. In fact, these subjects never come up when we make decisions.\n\nEasier said than done\n\nWhile the Buffett test for buying stocks is straightforward, it's easier said than done. The most difficult part is estimating earnings for a company for the next five or more years.\n\nBuffett readily acknowledged that he and Munger had frequently been unable to estimate future earnings with any degree of confidence, saying that this was \"usually the case.\" When this occurred, he stated succinctly, \"[W]e simply move on to other prospects.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe also noted that he and Munger had made mistakes in buying stocks at times. Staying within their \"circle of competence\" helped minimize such blunders, but it didn't completely eliminate them. This is an important point. Investors will be better equipped to estimate future earnings for the stocks in industries with which they are familiar.\n\nTwo stocks that pass the Buffett test in 2024\n\nBuffett hasn't bought many stocks in recent quarters -- evidence that he isn't finding many that pass his test. However, I think some stocks pass the Buffett test in 2024.\n\nD.R. Horton(NYSE: DHI) is one of them, in my view. Buffett initiated a stake in the homebuilder in 2023. Despite its shares soaring 70% last year, D.R. Horton trades at only 11.4 times expected earnings. That makes the stock attractively valued even if the company barely increases its earnings at all over the next five years.\n\nBut D.R. Horton should be able to deliver solid earnings growth. The U.S. still suffers from a severe housing shortage. With the Fed hinting that interest rates should come down somewhat in 2024, the company should be able to build and sell increasingly more homes for years to come.\n\nNow for a stock that Buffett doesn't own: Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). It's fair to say that Meta doesn't fall into the legendary investor's circle of competence, so he probably wouldn't feel comfortable estimating its future earnings. However, Wall Street appears to believe that it might pass the Buffett test. Meta's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on analysts' five-year earnings-growth projections is a low 0.79. Any PEG ratio below 1.0 is considered to be an attractive valuation.\n\nMeta has grown its earnings by an average of close to 8.5% annually over the last five years. Its financial performance has improved, though. If we assume that the company will increase its past earnings growth only slightly, the stock looks reasonably valued.\n\nBuffett's really simple alternative\n\nEach investor should follow Buffett's two-step process on their own before buying any stock in 2024. But don't worry if you aren't comfortable estimating earnings. Buffett has a really simple alternative that doesn't involve his test at all.\n\nHe argued in his letter to Berkshire shareholders in 2014 that most investors would be better off putting their money in low-cost S&P 500 index funds instead of trying to pick individual stocks. Buffett even predicted that anyone who follows this advice \"is virtually certain to get satisfactory results\" over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

Part of the reason why many notable analysts are bullish on the technology sector is the power of AI and generative AI software’s benefits for common people.\n\nWhy Did Tech Stocks Decline in the Start of 2024?\n\nJosh Brown, CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, recently talked on CNBC about the reason behind the decline in tech stocks in the first week of 2024. Brown said that there is a lot of profit-taking activity going on right now as investors saw remarkable returns from the technology sector in 2023, especially in the fourth quarter of the year. Brown said that as a wealth manager he can totally understand the logic of taking profits early in the year especially after such a spectacular rally. Brown, however, emphasized that the decline in tech stocks might look like these companies are “stumbling” but that is not the case.\n\nJosh Brown also said that 2024 is the year when AI goes from “concept to product.” While he is not totally happy with their valuations,  Alphabet and Amazon are the top two tech stocks to own according to Brown because of their AI catalysts.\n\nWise investors know that a decline in stocks for a week or two or even a few months for that matter means nothing when seen in the long run. Tech companies working on products and services that impact millions of people around the world with strong balance sheets are expected to keep gaining momentum in the months and years to come. That’s why many analysts and money managers are piling into these stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at some of the top technology stock picks of billionaire Ken Griffin. Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Investment Group Methodology For this article we scanned Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel LLC's 13F portfolio for the third quarter of 2023 and picked the fund's top 12 technology stock picks. Some notable names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\n12. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $319M\n\nKen Griffin’s Citadel decreased its stake in ride-sharing platform company Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) by 11% in the third quarter. The fund still owns a $319 million stake in Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER).\n\nCiti analyst Ronald Josey added Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) to his top picks for 2024. Here is what the analyst said about these companies:\n\n“Underlying these themes are companies that, in our view, are stronger than they were a year ago. Most have gone through cost reductions and optimizations themselves resulting in sustainable margin expansion and stronger overall balance sheets.”\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was the top contributor in the quarter following a better-than-expected 2Q23 earnings report and 3Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $33.6 billion were up 16% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17 billion grew 25% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 12% from last year. 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $916 million, up $552 million year over year, significantly beat Street estimates of $845 million and the company generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Management guided to continuing growth in 3Q Gross Bookings (17%-20% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $975-1,025 million).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.3 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.4 billion of investments, the company’s enterprise value of $95 billion equates to just over 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”\n\n11. AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $319M\n\nAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) Inc. ranks 11th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Griffin’s fund increased its stake in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) by 182% in the third quarter, ending the quarter with a $319 million stake in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 52 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T).\n\nMiller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.\n\nAT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”\n\n10. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $324M\n\nEven though Ken Griffin’s hedge fund cut its stake in social media platform company Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) by a whopping 53% in the third quarter, the fund still ended the period with a $324 million stake in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is enjoying a bullish view from analysts and hedge funds since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) successfully executed cost cutting and integrated AI in its products that led to huge usage growth.\n\nLike Meta, hedge funds are also buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nBlue Tower Asset Management made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On February 24, 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released Llama, their LLM project, with the code being open-source but the training weights being kept proprietary. Nonetheless, within a week the training weights were leaked for the project. This release of the weights for 65 billion parameter model was a huge gift for open-source programmers to begin experimenting upon. Within weeks, other developers were creating innovations building on the model. There has been a race towards developing low-budget fine-tuning projects that can be trained for specific applications at the cost of a few hundred dollars in some cases. Some of these LLM projects can even be run on individual computers rather than data centers.\n\nAfter the voluntary release of Llama’s architecture as open-source, the leak of the model weights ended up being a blessing in disguise for Meta. The innovation and improvements that followed were all built on Meta’s AI codebase. They were able to get these innovations without needing to pay any of the open-source developers for their efforts. This also demonstrates that the business advantage of the large tech companies is not in their models or AI codebase. Any innovations that the companies develop are unlikely to stay within the walls of the companies due to the mobility of researchers being poached between companies by recruiters. However, as these new model improvement technologies are made, the big tech companies have a scale advantage. They will be able to employ it into models that have more data, more compute budget, more parameters and therefore more intelligence in the resulting neural net.”\n\n9. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $355M\n\nDell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) ranks 9th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Citadel sold 818,057 shares of Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) during the third quarter. But the fund still owns a $355 million stake in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL).\n\nRecently, Citi opened a 90-day catalyst watch on Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) amid a bullish outlook of demand in the PC market.\n\n8. Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $399M\n\nKen Griffin’s hedge fund bought 122,566 more Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) shares during the third quarter, increasing its stake in the travel platform company to $399 million. The company is one of the best tech stocks to buy according to Ken Griffin.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) was Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $1.1 billion stake in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG).\n\nIn November, Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) posted Q3 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $72.32, beating estimates by $4.40. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 21.3% year over year to $7.34 billion, beating estimates by $80 million.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Following significant under-performance, some high-quality businesses in these sectors are now becoming more attractive from a valuation perspective – in our language they are now getting warmer on our Bench of potential investments.\n\nOur ‘all-weather’ portfolio centred around our unique definition of ‘quality’ delivered strong performance in the September quarter. Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Intuit and Natural Resource Partners, in alphabetical order), and another three companies almost reached this level of positive contribution. No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.\n\nAs part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.\n\nBooking Holdings, the world’s leading online travel agency, continues to benefit from a strong global travel environment with particular strength in Europe, Booking Holdings’ core market. Fears of peak ‘revenge travel’ following COVID-19 lockdowns have been misplaced in our view. We assess current travel volumes to be only slightly elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 trends, with some regions, particularly outbound travel from China, still relatively depressed. Anyone who has travelled anywhere recently will be nodding when we say hotel rates have increased meaningfully in recent times. Accommodation providers are generally doing quite well, but the increased hotel rates have been necessary to offset inflation in costs such as employee salaries and additional cleaning services. As Booking Holdings ‘clips the ticket’ of accommodation spend, the company has benefitted from increased average daily hotel rates. Importantly, Booking Holdings continues to invest in its business, improving the reach, quality and range of services it provides, resulting in gains in market share and an extension of its industry leadership position. Booking Holdings is now more fairly valued by the market, but still provides attractive base case risk-adjusted returns and remains one of the larger investments in the Fund.”\n\n7. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $552M\n\nMicron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the best technology stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. UBS recently called Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) one of its top semiconductor picks for 2024.\n\n\"Even after this rally into year-end, we would remain overweight semis in 2024 as inventory has peaked and started converting to revenue,\" UBS’s Timothy Arcuri said.\n\n6. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nKen Griffin’s Stake: $563M\n\nCybersec company Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) ranks 6th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. Citadel had a $563 million stake in Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) as of the end of September.\n\nRecently, Raymond James downgraded Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) stock to Market Perform from Outperform amid valuation concerns.\n\n\"To be clear, Palo Alto Networks is a great company, technology leader, execution has been stellar, and [Raymond James] doesn't fight investors that have a time horizon longer than its 12-month mandate. However, [Raymond James] believes the risk/reward in the stock is becoming less favorable,” Raymond James said.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Across the Information Technology universe, we seek companies possessing differentiated capabilities, products, and services. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) supplies network and cloud-based security solutions to enterprises, service providers, and government entities. The latest quarter was mixed with the company falling shy versus the Street on billings, in line for revenues, and outpacing earnings. Palo Alto’s updated guidance was materially ahead of lowered Street expectations. Nevertheless, its shares pulled back by -8%.”\n\nLike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Palo Alto is one of the stocks hedge funds are buying.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nKen Griffin Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates' Top 15 Dividend Stocks 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure.None. 12 Best Tech Stocks To Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffinwas initially published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value",
        "content": "In 2023, an extraordinary phenomenon unfolded in the stock market: The Magnificent Seven, a group of top-tier stocks, experienced a remarkable surge in their value, ranging from a solid 50% gain to a staggering 240% climb.\n\nThis impressive performance catapulted them into the spotlight as some of the market's most lucrative investments.\n\nAmid this financial whirlwind, a particular focus has been placed on Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Savvy investors, delving into the nuanced world of financial metrics, have pointed out the company's forward price-earnings ratio is notably lower compared to its peers in the Magnificent Seven, raising concern.\n\nAlphabet's valuation portrays the market's anticipation of its future, influenced by pivotal factors such as the seismic shifts brought about by artificial intelligence-driven changes in online consumer behavior, Google's fluctuating share in the digital advertising market and the looming shadow of an antitrust lawsuit. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nDecoding market dynamics: How Google stands in the competitive landscape\n\nThe market attributes a higher price-earnings ratio to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), while Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) falls within a comparable range when juxtaposed with Alphabet.\n\nThe price-earnings ratio is not an arbitrary figure that an investor can assign to determine value, as it has implicit cash flow assumptions. A business that generates a high return on invested capital has more potential to drive growth in cash flow. A high ROIC indicates a company's superior profitability and efficiency in capital allocation. This distinction becomes evident when comparing Apple and Microsoft to Google and Meta.\n\nApple and Microsoft have consistently outperformed Google and Meta in terms of return on invested capital. Their last 10-year average ROICs stood at 25.90% and 16.6%, respectively, while Google and Meta's stood at 13% and 16.20%, respectively. As a result, the figures show the other three peer companies have outperformed Google in terms of profitability and capital efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the contrary, the other three companies in this group, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may not boast impressive ROIC, but their allure lies in higher growth potential, for which investors willingly pay a premium. Specifically, Nvidia and Tesla, being smaller in terms of revenue size, contribute to their distinct valuation dynamics. Meanwhile, Amazon consistently maintains a high price-earnings ratio due to investor optimism surrounding its expanding presence in the retail sector and dominance in the cloud business.\n\nHowever, the search giant's declining market share in digital ad revenue is generating concerns, introducing a nuanced landscape. Lastly, the increasing use cases of AI represent both an opportunity and a threat to its existing business model, while developments in anti-trust lawsuits add a layer of skepticism. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhat are the concerns for Alphabet that are embedded in the price-earnings multiple?\n\nAlphabet recently outperformed expectations for its quarterly performance, beating earnings per share estimates by 6%, rebounding from a slowdown experienced in previous quarters. However, apprehensions persist, particularly concerning Google's search and overall ad revenue business. Lastly, its search revenue accounts for approximately 57% of total revenue and around 73% of total advertising revenue. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: Analyst's compilation\n\nWhile you may consider it cyclical, the declining market share in digital ad revenue does pose a question of whether Alphabet is losing its long-established dominance in this space.\n\nMeta Platforms and Amazon continue to gain market share in the digital ad revenue market, while Google experiences a decline. Moreover, the way we retrieve information on the internet is changing. AI chatbots are supplanting many of the activities we traditionally performed on search engines. The company realizes the threat to search ad revenue, prompting it to actively address the challenge and make rapid strides in integrating AI across all its services. Shifting Market Dynamics, Ambitious Projects Shape Alphabet's Value\n\nSource: InsiderIntelligence.com\n\nThe recent launch of Gemini, a family of large language models by Google, seems exciting, as it can counter the threat of other LLMs like GPT-4, Claude and Llama. However, it still needs to solve the challenges in the existing business model, where search contributes the most to the business.\n\nAlphabet's cloud division has experienced impressive growth, yet it operates in a highly competitive landscape where Amazon and Microsoft dominate. Investors are dissatisfied with the recent slowdown in the growth of the cloud business, which decreased to 22.5% year over year during the third quarter from 37.6% a year prior.\n\nGoogle's legal battle and the future of search\n\nAlphabet's Google is under legal scrutiny amid allegations of employing questionable tactics to uphold its status as the world's foremost search engine. The U.S. Justice Department claims Google paid massive sums to companies like Apple to make it the default search engine on their devices. Google also admitted that it shares 36% of revenue with Apple for the search results on the iPhone. We could draw several scenarios from this lawsuit.\n\nThe first scenario is that Google wins the case and stays the default search engine on devices like iPhones, and their partnership with Apple remains the same.\n\nThere is another scenario that may go in favor of Google. If the DOJ compels Apple to display a choice screen where users can select their preferred search engine, a majority would likely choose Google, and the search giant would not have to pay anything to Apple.\n\nBut the worst-case scenario would be that Apple develops its own native search engine that would be the default for its Safari browser on all devices, and users would not have any choice.\n\nBeing a default search engine is a huge advantage because most people who put search queries on the browser address bar need to intuitively think about which search engine they post their queries in.\n\nSince Apple will be losing out on revenue from Google in this scenario, there is a possibility that it will try to come up with its own native search engine to recoup the lost revenue. Hence, this scenario could harm Google's search revenue as Safari, Apple's native browser, holds around 20% market share.\n\nWaymo's expansion and Wing's drone delivery partnership with Walmart\n\nGoogle's other bets include several projects. In the recent earnings call, the company mentioned Waymo (an autonomous driving technology company) onboarded more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually added over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist.\n\nAt the same time, Wing, a drone delivery service owned by Google, has unveiled a strategic collaboration with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to offer drone delivery services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nWhile these developments are exciting, they have yet to reach a level of significance that would substantially impact the company's financials or long-term potential.\n\nFurther, in the age of AI, how we retrieve information online is changing. While Google is responding to these changes, its predominant business model, centered around search engine queries, faces potential risks stemming from shifts in how users consume information.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of a new digital era, the shift from traditional search engines to AI-driven chatbots marks a pivotal change in consumer behavior. The relentless advancement of LLMs is poised to revolutionize how we seek information, potentially rendering traditional search queries obsolete. This evolution raises critical questions about the future of advertising in an AI-dominated landscape.\n\nWhile the full extent of these changes remains shrouded in the mists of the future, their potential impact on giants like Alphabet cannot be underestimated. For investors, concerns over these AI-induced shifts challenging the company's dominance in search revenue are justified and crucial in navigating the uncertain waters of technological progression.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into as We Head Into 2024",
        "content": "As we look back on 2023, a few things stand out. One is how quickly generative artificial intelligence (AI) rose to prominence. OpenAI's ChatGPT was virtually unheard of as the year began but quickly became the rallying cry for a generation of tech investors.\n\nAnother was the emergence of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks, which outperformed the broader market by a wide margin (presented in order of stock price percentage gains):\n\nNvidia: Up 239% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): Up 194% Tesla: Up 102% Amazon: Up 81% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): Up 58% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): Up 57% Apple: Up 48%\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the potential to benefit from advancements in generative AI is the gossamer thread that weaves this group of stocks together. What is surprising is that Wall Street -- which rarely agrees on anything -- is moving in lockstep to snatch up stocks best positioned to profit from AI.\n\nBelow, I'll look at three stocks that hedge fund billionaires were piling into as 2023 drew to a close. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1: Microsoft\n\nKen Griffin is something of a legend on Wall Street, famously shorting stocks before the market crash of 1987, better known as \"Black Monday.\" Recent reports suggest the founder and CEO of Citadel plans to return $7 billion in profits to hedge fund investors after generating returns of roughly 15% last year -- outperforming many of his peers -- though the final tally hasn't been released.\n\nThis isn't the first time Griffin was at the top of the class. Citadel generated profits of $16 billion in 2022, dubbed \"the biggest annual windfall on record\" by CNN.\n\nOne of the biggest contributors to Griffin's success last year was an investment in Microsoft. Citadel is extremely diversified, with only four positions rising to more than 1% of the fund. Despite those constraints, Microsoft and video game titan Activision Blizzard made up its two largest holdings to close out the third quarter (the most recent period for which regulatory filings are available).\n\nStory continues\n\nCitadel had amassed a stake of 5 million shares of Microsoft stock, representing 1.7% of the fund, worth roughly $1.87 billion. It also held more than 15 million shares of Activision Blizzard stock, representing 1.5% of the fund's holdings, worth roughly $1.43 billion.\n\nMicrosoft recently completed its acquisition of Activision, so the position was likely used to leverage the merger arbitrage -- a way to profit from the difference between Activision's then-current stock price and the eventual purchase price.\n\nHowever, there's little doubt Griffin owns Microsoft because of the vast potential of AI. He's been vocal about the potential represented by generative AI, admitting that Citadel uses Microsoft Copilot, which he said increases the productivity of the funds' developers by 10%. With 1,500 developers on staff, that's the equivalent of increasing its workforce by 150 people. He also says that the adoption of AI is still in the \"early innings.\"\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Sept. 30), AI systems like Copilot buoyed Microsoft's Azure cloud results, as revenue grew 29% year over year. This not only outpaced its cloud rivals, but Microsoft noted that 3 percentage points of the gains were the result of increasing demand for AI services.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2: Alphabet\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman is the founder and CEO of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and is well known on Wall Street. He made his name as an aggressive activist investor, buying shares in undervalued companies and agitating for change. Among his most notable wins was turning a $60 million position in distressed shopping mall operator General Growth Properties -- a company on the fast track to bankruptcy -- into a profit of nearly $3.5 billion.\n\nUnlike many funds, Pershing Square is highly concentrated, with its $10 billion portfolio invested in just seven companies. The largest stake -- by a fair margin -- is Alphabet. The fund owns 9.38 million Class C shares and 4.35 million Class A shares, making the total value of the stake $1.92 billion. This represents more than 19% of the Pershing Square portfolio.\n\nIn an interview last month, Ackman laid out the logic for his biggest stake. \"It was AI that created the opportunity for us to buy Google at an attractive price,\" Ackman said.\n\nHe suggested investor fears that Alphabet had fallen behind Microsoft in AI crushed the stock. He went on to note that Alphabet's industry-leading digital advertising business alone is worth the stock price, and investors get all the AI potential \"for free.\" He also believes that Alphabet's AI technology is competitive with -- if not ahead of -- Microsoft's.\n\nAckman has a point. Alphabet has a long and storied history of developing AI, and the rebound of online advertising from its historic slump is already improving the company's financial results. The vast potential to benefit from AI is icing on the cake.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 3: Meta Platforms\n\nBillionaire Chase Coleman is one of Wall Street's boy geniuses and a member of the fabled Tiger Cubs -- a group of hedge fund managers that learned their craft from Julian Robertson, Jr., legendary founder of Tiger Management. Coleman parlayed $25 million in seed money into more than $13 billion in assets under management for Tiger Global Management, the hedge fund he founded.\n\nMeta Platforms is by far the fund's largest holding, totaling 8.9 million shares, or roughly 20% of the portfolio (not a typo). Its stake is valued at more than $3 billion.\n\nColeman has made no secret that he's intrigued by the potential of AI, saying, \"Tech is interesting again,\" thanks to the advent of AI, which he refers to as \"pretty interesting new technology.\" His advice for those investing in AI? \"Think about it in terms of companies investing in these technologies and how well they use it.\"\n\nWhen it comes to using AI, Meta Platforms has a long and distinguished track record, deploying these advanced algorithms to tag people in photos, surface relevant content, and target advertising on its bevy of social media sites. The company also leveraged its AI expertise to develop generative AI models that are available on all the major cloud infrastructure services -- for a fee, of course.\n\nFurthermore, the ongoing rebound in online advertising has already fueled an uptick in Meta's results, a trend that will likely continue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Meta Platforms is US$521 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Meta Platforms' US$347 share price signals that it might be 33% undervalued The US$380 analyst price target for META is 27% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nDoes the January share price for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$44.1b US$49.8b US$58.3b US$65.9b US$73.5b US$79.1b US$83.9b US$88.0b US$91.5b US$94.8b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x18 Analyst x15 Analyst x5 Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Est @ 7.64% Est @ 6.01% Est @ 4.87% Est @ 4.08% Est @ 3.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6%  US$41.0k US$43.0k US$46.8k US$49.2k US$51.0k US$51.0k US$50.2k US$48.9k US$47.3k US$45.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$474b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$95b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.2%) = US$1.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.8t÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$865b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.3t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$347, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.076. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Interactive Media and Services industry.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "title": "2 FAANG Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2024, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Over multidecade periods, Wall Street has proved to be a bona fide wealth-creating machine. But over shorter timelines, such as a few months or a couple of years, directional moves in the major stock indexes can be unpredictable.\n\nFor the past decade, when the going has gotten tough on Wall Street, investors have turned to the time-tested FAANG stocks.\n\nBy \"FAANG,\" I'm talking about:\n\nFacebook, which is now a subsidiary of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from absolutely crushing the broader market in the return department over the trailing decade, these five companies dominate their respective industries.\n\nMeta Platforms owns some of the top social media \"real estate\" on the planet and attracted nearly 4 billion active users to its sites each month during the September-ended quarter. Apple's iPhone accounts for better than 50% of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, its share repurchase program over the past decade is unmatched by any public company. Nearly 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022 can be traced to Amazon's online marketplace. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is also the world's top cloud infrastructure service provider by spending. Netflix is both the domestic and international market share leader in streaming services. Further, no streaming company comes close to matching its library of original content. Alphabet's Google is pretty much a monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in December.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the FAANGs could differ dramatically in the new year. While two of these outperformers remain historically inexpensive and are ripe for the picking, another industry leader has seen its growth engine stall.\n\nFAANG stock No. 1 to buy hand over fist in 2024: Meta Platforms\n\nDespite shares nearly tripling in 2023, social media stock Meta Platforms stands out as a clear-cut value play in the new year (and beyond).\n\nStory continues\n\nArguably, the biggest risk for Meta is the possibility of the U.S. falling into a recession in 2024. A couple of money-focused metrics and forecasting tools with exemplary track records do suggest a challenging year lies ahead. Since Meta generates more than 98% of its revenue from advertising and businesses are typically quick to pare back their ad spending in a weakening economy, this would be bad news for the company.\n\nThe thing about recessions that's often overlooked is just how short-lived they typically are. Nine of the 12 recessions following World War II haven't lasted a year, while none of the remaining three made it past 18 months. By comparison, there have been two economic expansions that endured at least a full decade since 1945. More often than not, ad-driven companies are enjoying a favorable economic climate.\n\nWhat really puts the ball in Meta's court is its aforementioned social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site globally, while Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are, collectively, among the most-downloaded apps worldwide. In spite of seemingly endless competition, Meta's social media apps continue to shine and draw in a greater number of monthly active users. That's great news for its ad-pricing power.\n\nInvestors should also consider that Meta's mammoth operating cash flow and cash-rich balance sheet give it the luxury of investing in high-growth initiatives. Though its augmented/virtual reality segment, Reality Labs, has lost nearly $11.5 billion through the first nine months of 2023, its family of apps has generated $41.8 billion in profit. Meta is also sitting on more than $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. CEO Mark Zuckerberg can make investments for the future without hurting his company's bread-and-butter operating segment.\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms remains historically cheap after its big run-up. Shares can be purchased for 11.8 times forward-year cash flow, which is 25% below Meta's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing five years.\n\nFAANG stock No. 2 to buy hand over fist in 2024: Alphabet\n\nThe other FAANG stock investors can confidently buy hand over fist in 2024 is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nNot to sound like a broken record, but Alphabet shares the same biggest concern as Meta Platforms: a potential slowdown in advertising. Alphabet brought in about 78% of its revenue during the third quarter from advertising. If the U.S. economy slows down in the new year, it's probable that businesses would taper their ad spending -- at least in the short run.\n\nWhat Alphabet has working in its favor is its practical monopoly status in global internet search. According to monthly search share data provided by GlobalStats, the last time Google closed out a month with less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search was March 2015. It's the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to reach consumers, which should propel strong ad-pricing power for parent company Alphabet.\n\nHowever, it's the company's ancillary operating segments that represent its most-intriguing growth prospects in 2024 (and beyond). In particular, cloud infrastructure service provider Google Cloud has turned the corner to recurring profitability. Enterprise cloud spending has a long growth runway, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, as of the September-ended quarter.\n\nYouTube is no slouch, either. It's attracting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, which trails only Facebook, and has seen daily views of Shorts (short-form videos that typically last less than a minute) shoot past 50 billion. Both premium subscriptions and advertising demand should increase in the new year.\n\nBest of all, Alphabet remains inexpensive. Shares can be purchased for 14.4 times forward-year cash flow to begin 2024. That's a notable discount to its average cash flow multiple of 18 over the previous five years. Image source: Apple.\n\nThe FAANG stock to avoid like the plague in the new year: Apple\n\nUnfortunately, not every FAANG stock is poised to be a winner in 2024. Although tech stock Apple has been one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 over the past 20 years, it's not a company I'd suggest putting money to work in this year.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- Apple is a pretty phenomenal business. As noted, it accounts for half or more of U.S. smartphone market share. Further, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the evolution of Apple into a platforms-focused company. An operating model that emphasizes subscription services should lift Apple's operating margin over time, as well as alleviate some of the wild revenue swings that usually accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nBut it's not about where Apple has been so much as where it's going. Right now, Apple isn't going anywhere. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple reported an $11 billion (2.8%) year-over-year decline in sales. Though its services segment generated 9% sales growth for the fiscal year, every physical product division saw sales decline -- iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Wearables.\n\nWhat makes this underperformance even more eye-popping is that it occurred with above-average inflation as a tailwind. Apple is one of the best-known and most-trusted brands on the planet. The fact that it wasn't able to raise its prices enough to lift its sales with above-average inflation demonstrates how weak organic demand was for its physical products in fiscal 2023.\n\nTo add to this, while Apple was able to avoid a decline in year-over-year earnings per share thanks to its incredible share repurchase program, net income did decline from $99.8 billion to $97 billion. In other words, buybacks appear to be the only thing really saving Apple stock from a meltdown at this point.\n\nHistorically, investors have had no qualms paying an aggressive multiple to own shares of Apple if the company is growing by a double-digit rate. But with a negative real-growth rate, Apple stock is highly unattractive at 27 times forward-year earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Mega-Trend Movers: 7 Stocks Capitalizing on Global Shifts",
        "content": "Megatrends will continue to develop, creating incredible opportunities. Here are seven of the top megatrend stocks that are capitalizing on one or more powerful trends you shouldn’t avoid. I’ll be talking about fintech, e-commerce, emerging economies, the rise of India, and the true beginning of the metaverse. That’s not an exhaustive list of current megatrend stocks, but it’s a good start.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top megatrend stocks to consider is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). As one of the fastest-growing e-commerce companies in the world, it’s been compared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The only difference is that MELI serves the Latin American market. So, right off the bat, MercadoLibre touches on e-commerce, fintech, and rising interest in emerging economies.\n\nThe primary reason an investor should consider investing in any company is for its fundamentals. Fortunately, Mercado Libre is very strong fundamentally. The growth metrics underpinning the firm are very, very strong. For example, in the third quarter, revenues increased by 69.1% reaching $3.8 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTotal payment volume grew by 121.3%, growing to $47.3 billion. In addition, it’s abundantly clear that MercadoLibre’s fintech payments system, Mercado Pago, is growing incredibly fast.\n\nSify Technologies (SIFY) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nNext up is Sify Technologies (NASDAQ:SIFY). The reason I wanted to focus on Sify is that India is becoming much more important to the global economy. The country is one of the fastest growing in the world, clocking an annual GDP growth rate of 5.5%. Better, India is expected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2027.\n\nThe company grew by 11% in the most recent quarter and continues to be profitable, although decreasingly so. India continues to be noted for its burgeoning IT sector. So investors should expect companies like Sify Technologies to increasingly gain exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 promises to be a big year for megatrend stocks, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). For one, Apple is set to release its Vision Pro augmented/virtual reality headset in late January or early February.  The first wave of Vision Pros should be shipped in about a month. It’s also expected that the company will ship roughly 500,000 headsets in 2024.\n\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, isn’t expected to have a large impact on Apple financially. Remember, Apple sells roughly 200 million iPhones per year so the Vision Pro isn’t particularly important from a fiscal perspective. However, it is important in that it will propel Apple farther into the metaverse. It simply gives investors another reason to consider Apple which has a track record of releasing viral products that the world is very quick to adopt en masse.\n\nGrab Holdings (GRAB) Motorcycle helmet with Grab logo on a motorcycle parked at the road side\n\nSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) is a mega app serving a diverse base of customers across a handful of emerging Southeast Asian growth economies. The stock hits on a few important megatrends, specifically the emergence of Southeast Asia and emerging technologies overall.\n\nWhen I say emerging technologies, I’m referring to Grab Holdings and its development of a super app that places a huge variety of services at users’ fingertips. The company’s app allows a user to hail a taxi, get food delivered, pay for services, get insurance, and access telemedicine among other things.\n\nInvestors continue to be interested in Grab Holdings because the company is located in Singapore, one of the world’s great financial hubs. further, Singapore is centrally located and provides close access to burgeoning Southeast Asian economies that continue to gain attention. As the world’s mega powers continue to deal with difficulties of their own investors are increasingly looking to untapped markets to satisfy their desire for growth. Southeast Asia is full of such potential.\n\n2024 is going to be marked by quantitative easing which will make Grab Holdings’ losses look less important and its 61% revenue growth look that much more attractive.\n\nAdyen (ADYEY) undervalued fintech stocks A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word \"Fintech,\" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth. Fintech Stock Bargains, fintech stock\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdyen (OTCMKTS:ADYEY) Is a leading fintech stock and a company capitalizing on a global shift in payments. It’s another one of the top megatrend stocks you may want to consider.\n\nBrick-and-mortar retail is fading as e-commerce continues to grow. Likewise, cash is beginning to take a back seat to digitized payments. These shifts are broadly called fintech which is the emergence of new payment systems.\n\nAdd Yin is also one of the leading firms in the unified payments space. The unified payments space refers to the idea that all of your various digital payments can be unified into a single swipe, for example. The company saw a 25% increase in its unified payments volume in the third quarter. Revenues increased by 22%, reaching 413.6 million euros.\n\nA report from McKinsey pegged fintech growth between 2022 and 2028 at 15% annually. The payment space will continue to provide strong growth opportunities for investors in the years to come.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, take a look at megatrend stocks, like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which is set to capitalize on the long arc of metaverse development. The company famously changed its stock name from Facebook to Meta Platforms in late 2021 signaling a larger shift.\n\nThen things rapidly unraveled as the realities of 2022 set in. The era of pandemic largess, stimulus payments, and runaway inflation was over. A period of fiscal conservatism marked by a series of rapid decreases in the federal funds rate resulted in a rapid decline in the company’s share price.\n\nTo be clear, Meta Platforms 2022 troubles were a consequence of declining ad revenues much more than its choice to rebrand. Ad revenues from its family of apps segment continue to drive the business and its results. So, META stock is more a macroeconomic story than it is a metaverse story if you follow my message. Revenues are again strong as the economy continues to show signs of strength, resulting in 23% top line growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company continues to run the advertising that shows real utilitarian development of its metaphors applications. The company is in position to see some real returns from what once looked like a crazy investment.\n\nFiverr (FVRR) The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: Temitiman / Shutterstock.com\n\nFiverr (NYSE:FVRR) is a solid stock to consider for investors looking to capitalize on seismic shifts in labor. The company has successfully developed an e-commerce platform that allows freelancers to sell their services efficiently.\n\nThe result is that today the company sees more than 92 million in quarterly revenues which translates to a moderate growth rate. more importantly, it’s a well-established, stabilizing firm overall. Of course, Fiverr benefits from the continued growth in freelance work and the movement away from traditional employment. What’s particularly important to note about the company from a fundamental perspective is that it is rapidly approaching profitability.\n\nThe company did produce a moderate net income of $3.03 million in Q3. Its net loss through the first nine months of 2023 declined from more than $70 million to just above $1 million. As more and more people shun the traditional work environment and Fiverr marches toward increasing profitability, expect its share price to rise.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 7 Hottest Tech Stocks to Watch in 2024",
        "content": "With Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) skyrocketing to blistering heights in 2023, the question on everyone’s mind now is as follows: what will be the hottest tech stocks in 2024? At the start of the new year, it’s worth carefully examining this inquiry. After all, we have favorable circumstances moving in the bulls’ direction.\n\nAs a broader point, the economy last year avoided the much-dreaded recession bullet. Along with that, the Federal Reserve saw encouraging disinflationary trends. Indeed, the data was apparently so enticing that Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at possible interest rate cuts in 2024. If so, that would likely undergird hot tech stocks.\n\nMore to the point, the technology machinery appears to be running flat out on all cylinders. As a result, semiconductor specialist Nvidia enjoyed dramatic upside. But it’s also possible that investors will be rotating their portfolio to seek out the next big hit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf that’s you, below are intriguing ideas to consider for hottest tech stocks.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nA legacy tech giant, IBM (NYSE:IBM) used to be the talk of the town when the baby boomers dominated the market. Now, Big Blue has given way to other hipper ideas for hottest tech stocks. Still, I believe this old dog can learn new tricks. It’s been on the move in the past half-year period. And analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy, with the high-side price target reaching $179.\n\nPrimarily, what makes IBM an intriguing idea for hot tech stocks centers on its specialty in machine learning. Basically, ML is a component of artificial intelligence, fostering algorithms techniques for machines to learn from data. According to Statista, the ML market size will likely hit $204.3 billion by the end of this year. Further, the sector volume could land at $528.1 billion by 2030.\n\nAs an investment idea, I understand that IBM doesn’t get the juices flowing. However, investors should note that shares trade at a lowly forward earnings multiple of 16.22X. Also, its forward dividend yield stands at 4.1%, which is very generous for one of the hottest tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn everywhere, everything idea within the vast innovation ecosystem, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers a sensible idea for hot tech stocks. No, it’s not exciting. However, it more than held its own in 2023, beating out the performance of the Nasdaq Composite index. Analysts believe the solid run will continue this year, pegging shares a consensus strong buy. Also, the average price target lands at $424.36.\n\nFor me, MSFT is appealing because it has its hands on several innovative fields. However, if I had to pick one, it would be its aggressive investments in AI, particularly generative AI. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market size reached a valuation of $29 billion in 2022.\n\nFurther, the segment could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.5% to 2030. At the forecast culmination, the segment could be worth nearly $668 billion. And that’s not including other compelling business units such as Azure and its Office Software as a Service (SaaS) platform.\n\nFinally, MSFT isn’t exactly traded at a discount. However, it enjoys solid long-term revenue growth and consistent profitability. Thus, it’s one of the hot tech stocks to consider.\n\nLeidos (LDOS) Leidos (LDOS) logo on the side of an office building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormerly known as Science Applications International Corporation, Leidos (NYSE:LDOS) has its hands in several relevant businesses, including defense, aviation, information technology and biomedical research. Thus, it’s one of the great investments to consider for the long haul. However, it does have the advantage of being one of the hottest tech stocks. Analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $121.83 average price target.\n\nFundamentally, Leidos draws attention for its cybersecurity business. Per its website, the company is recognized as a sector leader across the federal government. Further, at the end of this year, the global cybersecurity market could print revenue of $183.1 billion. Plus, experts project that the sector will expand at a CAGR of 10.56%. If so, we’re talking a market volume of $273.6 billion by 2028.\n\nFinally, Leidos makes an enticing case for hot tech stocks to buy because of its attractive valuation. Currently, the market prices at LDOS at a forward earnings multiple of 14.11X, lower than the sector median 23.8X. Given the upward growth trajectory of cybersecurity along with its other relevancies, the discount appears credible.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) inherently draws attention for its massive social network. Cynically, META ranks among the hottest tech stocks thanks to leveraging a veritable data goldmine. However, the company has also transitioned to several innovative arenas. It performed quite well last year and analysts remain enthused, pegging shares a consensus strong buy. Also, the average price target lands at $391.57.\n\nOne of the compelling focus areas for Meta has been its investment in the metaverse. Now, I’m not going to say that I’m a huge fan of the concept. Nevertheless, the underlying virtual reality market should be huge. According to Mordor Intelligence, the VR market size reached a valuation of $54.24 billion last year. Further, the segment should expand at a CAGR of 24.74%, ultimately reaching $163.82 billion by 2028.\n\nTo be sure, with META marching toward the 200% up mark (it fell a bit short) in 2023, you’re not going to get a discount here. However, the company maintains a strong long-term revenue growth rate while staying consistently profitable. Thus, it’s a solid idea for hot tech stocks.\n\nCanaan (CAN) web browser showing Canaan (CAN) logo on website\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Jarretera\n\nMoving into the extremely speculative segment of the hottest tech stocks, investors that are willing to throw caution to the wind should take a look at Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN). As a specialist in blockchain mining hardware, CAN might be appealing to those who want to participate broadly in the cryptocurrency sector but don’t actually want to directly take the risk. Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $4.25 average price target.\n\nObviously, the narrative for Canaan revolves around how well cryptos perform in 2024. If the sector continues to build upon what materialized near the end of last year, CAN may fly higher. What makes the idea more tempting is that its market performance wasn’t really that impressive compared to its blockchain-mining peers. However, a once-ignored opportunity could easily transition to a blistering outperformer in the crypto paradigm.\n\nStill, caution is key. For example, it’s true that Canaan enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 37.6%, which is outstanding. Still, the problem is that the mining equipment specialist’s fortunes are heavily tied to crypto sentiment. So, just be careful how much exposure you have.\n\nD-Wave Quantum (QBTS) QBTS stock: Person holding mobile phone with logo of Canadian hardware company D-Wave Systems Inc. on screen in front of web page.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nAs the name suggests, D-Wave Quantum (NYSE:QBTS) specializes in quantum computing. Per its public profile, D-Wave claims to be the world’s first company to sell computers that exploit quantum effects in their operations. It’s been incredibly choppy over the past 52 weeks. Nevertheless, analysts appreciate the opportunity, pegging shares a unanimous strong buy. Also, the average price target clocks in at $2.17.\n\nIn a nutshell, classical computers – no matter how fast they are – operate in a binary linearism. In order for a set of problems to be solved, the initial challenge must be addressed before the next obstacle can be engaged. Think about unlocking a lock by entering every possible combination. It would take a while. On the other hand, quantum computers can run multiple problem sets simultaneously due to the underlying weird nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nHere’s the bottom line. According to BCC Research, the sector may grow from $904.7 million last year to $6.5 billion by 2028. That would be a CAGR of 48.1%, which is astonishing. However, the risk is that QBTS trades for 12.62X trailing revenue, which is screaming high.\n\nAsensus Surgical (ASXC) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nA literal penny stock, you want to be supremely cautious with Asensus Surgical (NYSEAMERICAN:ASXC). Frankly, I’m hesitant to even naming this idea for the hottest tech stocks available. As you can see from its 52-week chart, ASXC is volatile as fudge, as the kids like to say. Still, the underlying surgical robotics specialty draws much interest. Analysts are split with a moderate buy rating. The average price target stands at $1.50, which is intense.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global surgical robots market size reached a valuation of $3.92 billion last year. Experts project that the sector may expand at a CAGR of 9.5% from 2024 to 2030. At the forecast culmination, the industry may generate annual revenue of $7.42 billion. For ASXC, the idea is to get a piece of the pie. With a market capitalization of less than $100 million, it may not need to grab much for shares to skyrocket.\n\nFrankly, whether it will or not requires a whole lot of faith. We’re talking the kind that led to Indiana Jones taking a step in that deep chasm, hoping that his foot would land on an invisible bridge. Shares trade at 13.84X trailing revenue so you really need to think about this one carefully before diving in.\n\nPenny Stocks\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com’s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: Penny Stocks — How to Profit Without Getting Scammed\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Hottest Meme Stocks to Watch in 2024",
        "content": "The meme stock mania of 2021 turned out to be a rollercoaster ride for investors. During that heady period, it felt as though every potential meme stock was destined to soar, propelled by an unprecedented wave of speculative frenzy. This led to short-squeeze rallies, which effectively transformed stocks into multibaggers almost overnight.\n\nFast forward to the present and the allure of meme stocks remains intact, which makes wagering on hot meme stocks imperative. Investors continue to be drawn to the tantalizing prospect of making quick gains. However, unlike the indiscriminate surge of 2021, not every seemingly hot meme stock now is a golden ticket.\n\nThis isn’t to say that all meme stock trades are whims of irrational exuberance. But they do require a readiness to embrace the inherent volatility and contrarian nature of such assets. In essence, while the meme stock phenomenon continues to evolve, it demands a more nuanced approach from investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors wondering what the hottest meme stocks of 2024 might be should consider these three picks.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) faced a challenging conclusion to 2023, marked by high capital expenditures and dwindling electric vehicle (EV) sales. This combination pressured the company’s sales model, leading to underwhelming earnings. Yet the narrative around EVs remains robust over the long-term, especially in countries including Canada that are transitioning away from gas-powered cars.\n\nThere are firm benefits from this undeniable shift towards EVs despite the costly implications of rapid expansion. A potential silver lining emerges with lower debt costs in the event of rate cuts, catalyzing ChargePoint’s growth and solidifying its industry foothold.\n\nInvestors eyeing long-term opportunities may find solace in ChargePoint’s unique advantage: its global charging network. Unlike Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)and EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO), ChargePoint has already established an international presence, a feat Tesla aspires to but has yet to achieve. However, patience is imperative with CHPT stock and immediate surges are unlikely considering the recent drop in demand and the substantial investments required for infrastructure development.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis reality was reflected in the company’s revised revenue guidance after the third quarter, with a notable 12% year-over-year (YOY) revenue drop to $110 million and a net loss of $158.2 million. Despite these setbacks and a lowered sales forecast, ChargePoint’s global network positions it as a potentially rewarding long-term investment in the burgeoning EV sphere and one of the next hot meme stocks.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is strategically sharpening its focus on substantially improving its return on invested capital (ROIC), aiming to elevate it into double digits. This shift towards optimizing capital allocation and efficiency reflects a concerted effort to expand profitability. By directing capital towards high-return projects and businesses, Alibaba not only amplifies shareholder value but fortifies its competitive edge.\n\nThe company’s adept management of $67 billion in non-core and low-growth investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 exemplifies its commitment to maximizing shareholder returns and realigning its portfolio with its core business strategies. However, Alibaba’s trajectory has faced challenges, mainly due to new U.S. export control regulations initiated in August 2023. The ripple effect of these controls has compelled Alibaba to pause the planned division of its cloud services.\n\nDespite these headwinds and a general slowdown in growth, Alibaba remains a profitable entity. The easing of Beijing’s tech crackdown and China’s continued economic expansion presented a promising outlook for the eCommerce titan.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is one of 2023’s most remarkable turnaround stories, defying Wall Street’s skepticism, especially after its growth hiccup last year. Despite a 64% drop in value in 2022, Meta surged by over 170% in 2023. This resurgence underscores that even well-established companies can efficiently navigate operational challenges and market rebound with vigor.\n\nA key driver behind this revival is Meta’s strategic leverage of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has been instrumental in monetizing the massive user bases of Facebook and Instagram, with innovative products such as Imagine, a standalone AI image generator, marking its foray into new tech frontiers. Additionally, Meta’s mastery in monetizing its prime social media assets is evident. It ended the quarter with a 7% YOY increase in monthly active users across its platforms, totaling 3.96 billion.\n\nDespite past strategic missteps, including soaring capital expenditure and weakened ad targeting, Meta’s commitment to innovation is evident in ventures including the Metaverse and virtual reality (VR). This signals a transformative future for the company. The company’s recent 23% YOY revenue growth is a testament to its renewed stability and potential as well, making it another great pick for investors looking for hot meme stocks in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks to Ring in the New Year: SNAP, META, PINS",
        "content": "The top social media stocks of 2023 saw much relief, with many clocking in high double-digit percentage gains. And now, social media firms are moving from saving money to AI investing. The strategy is to gain an edge over rivals in winning user engagement.\n\nSocial media stocks will continue their course as the financial benefits of AI appear steadily over time. Although the social stocks’ 2023 gains may not repeat in 2024, it isn’t time to throw in the towel yet. So, let’s explore such stocks to see which deserves a spot on your watchlist for the new year and beyond.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NASDAQ:SNAP) has been snapping back since bottoming out in late September. This partly due to a notable analyst upgrade, AI feature news, and impressive Snaperchat+ numbers, with over 7 million subscribers. Shares more than doubled (103% gains) from trough to peak. Then, they slipped just north of 9% as a part of a broader pullback in tech.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRecently, Wells Fargo named Snap as one of its top platform picks. I think the recent dip should be watched closely by investors interested in the name. Snap isn’t just waiting for industry tides to shift back in its favor. Instead, the firm is tapping into creativity for its platform. Thus far, they’ve resonated with some users.\n\nAs Snap continues AI experimentation, perhaps it could evolve into a social media mentor. Quite possibly, other up-and-coming firms may go beyond the TikTok age.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUndoubtedly, MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ:META) has been the most incredible of all. It boasts impressive moves and ultimately made an enviable 178% gain for 2023.\n\nPerhaps the most enticing of the Magnificent Seven right now, the stock’s glorious 2023 comeback is a work of beauty. It’s tempting to take profits as tech begins to show a bit of fragility in the early stages of 2024. However, it could be a mistake to dump Meta while its stirring the AI and metaverse pots.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough 2024, I expect AI to continue strengthening Meta’s Family of Apps. Additionally, we may finally see the metaverse, which peaked in 2021-22, return to the spotlight.\n\nNot only are new Meta Quest headsets more capable than their predecessors, opening up windows within digital realms, but also prices on older headsets are coming down. High-end users will be kept happy with the latest and greatest. But newcomers will be lured to give virtual reality (VR) a try with cheaper headsets. It’s a win-win scenario, all while new games and social experiences look to flow through the VR pipeline.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NASDAQ:PINS) had a relatively muted year compared to Meta. Despite solid 2023 gains, the stock remains down over 58% from its 2021 all-time high. Indeed, the Pinterest bubble has burst. The comeback has been less fierce. Yet, I do believe investors have a lot to gain with the social underdog at this depth.\n\nEvercore analyst Mark Mahaney sees Pinterest’s earnings growth accelerating in 2024. Also, the image-sharing social-media platform is a top platform pick of Wells Fargo. At a mere 8.7x price-to-sales (P/S), PINS seems like a tempting low-cost growth pick to make up for lost time in the new year.\n\nTherefore, Pinterest may be a relative social media underdog that could surprise all of us in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Global Gaming Giants: 3 Stocks Leveling Up in International Markets",
        "content": "Gaming stocks describe a wide swath of companies working in many niche spaces. Game development, hardware manufacturing, mobile app creation and more all fall under the wider gaming stock umbrella. Increasingly, a handful of those gaming stocks are penetrating international markets and are turning into gaming giants.\n\nWhile gaming stocks historically enjoyed popularity in the United States, China and a handful of smaller countries like Japan and South Korea. Those companies are increasingly rooted in emerging markets. Recent research points to rapid gaming growth in the Philippines, Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico and other international markets.\n\nWhile we’re seeing gaming stocks adapt to those markets differently—think lower price points, in-game Easter eggs, and similar features—some 2024 gaming stock trends point to particular strength for these three companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNintendo (NTDOY, NTDOF) A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.\n\nSource: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year saw a lot of rumor and hype for Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY, OTCMKTS:NTDOF), but little transpired to send the stock stratospheric. In a few short months, Nintendo news included a possible virtual reality headset and a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquisition. While most of Nintendo’s high-flying potential projects remain unconfirmed, two key developments point to major tailwinds pushing Nintendo higher soon. When it comes to gaming giants, Nintendo is one of the biggest names out there.\n\nFirst, Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. Movie saw record sales, securing over $1.3 billion annually. That success caused a realization that, among Nintendo’s massive intellectual property portfolio, there’s a host of franchises ripe for moviemaking. Now, Nintendo is capitalizing on the opportunity by developing a Legend of Zelda movie with an undetermined release schedule. With international Super Mario Bros. sales dwarfing the domestic equivalent, this hotly-anticipated Nintendo movie will surely make waves abroad and put some sails back into Nintendo stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nLess clear, but no less exciting, is whether Nintendo will release a follow-up to its popular Nintendo Switch gaming platform in 2024. European reporters indicated that, in August last year, they got a sneak peek at the new console. Nintendo Switch sales total more than 130 million global units, so a new console dropping in 2024 would be a major boon to the gaming stock’s international positioning.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\n2024 might be a breakthrough year for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) if predictions that the company’s virtual reality offerings gain momentum hold true. Meta’s new Quest 3 VR headset is already gaining ground on Steam, falling behind two Oculus platforms (also made by Meta) and Valve’s Index HMD headset. With three of the top four spots snagged by Meta, the company has a clear lead in the virtual reality gaming market. Global virtual reality gaming should grow substantially from 2024 onward, with some projecting the global market to grow 31% annually through 2028.\n\nAt the same time, on the lower-tech end of the spectrum, Meta’s Facebook instant game offerings are increasingly popular in emerging markets. These players represent the opposite end of the spectrum, in general, of those interested in VR. Dubbed hypercasual gamers, this market wants a brief respite or distraction from daily life and isn’t interested in anchoring a lifestyle around a gaming platform. This demographic is also easily monetized, as banner ads, in-game videos and microtransactions create an ecosystem ripe for opportunity as Meta continues nurturing this segment.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) the netflix logo displayed on a tablet that a person is holding while laying down\n\nSource: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) might seem a surprising choice on a list of top international gaming stocks.For many, the company’s core value is in its varied streaming video titles. However, Netflix is making increasing inroads into gaming, as evidenced by its cloud-based mobile game testing in Canadian and United Kingdom markets last year. For example, the Grand Theft Auto trilogy is playable on Netlix. While the tech is still in its relative infancy, a complete Netflix ecosystem integrating streaming titles, gaming and live sports could put the juggernaut back into the S&P 500’s top 10.\n\nFrom a bigger-picture strategic perspective, Netflix has made its intention to target international markets clear. In 2023, co-CEO Greg Peters told reporters that Netflix intended to break down geographic boundaries for filmmakers and “give them the ability to connect that story with a huge global audience.” If we combine Netflix’s clear global-mindedness with its emerging gaming opportunities, there’s a huge chance that Netflix will reassert itself on the hierarchy in 2024. It may not seem like its turf, but Netflix is slowly becoming one of the top gaming giants.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery",
        "content": "The share price of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has undergone significant volatility, as evidenced by its dramatic fluctuations. In September 2021, the share price stood at $379 per share, but by October 2022, it had plummeted to nearly $92. However, there has been a robust recovery since then, with the price settling around $358 per share at the time of writing. This remarkable turnaround has resulted in year-to-date gains of 180% for Meta. Let's take a closer look to determine whether the stock is attractive to investors at the current price.\n\nEmbracing the Metaverse beyond Facebook\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\n\nMeta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, underwent a significant rebranding in October 2021. The company's original core application, Facebook, was a primary driver of user engagement, revenue and profitability. The rebranding to Meta, which hints at the concept of the \"Metaverse,\" reflects the company's future direction. With a mission \"to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together,\" the social meadia giant aims to make the metaverse a reality through its diverse product offerings. The company operates through two main business segments: the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).\n\nIn 2022, the FoA segment, which includes popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, was a major revenue generator. It brought in nearly $114.5 billion, accounting for 98.2% of Meta's total revenue. This segment primarily earns through selling advertising placements to marketers. On the other hand, the RL segment, focused on virtual and augmented reality technologies, contributed significantly less, with revenue of only $2.16 billion, less than 2% of the total sales. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nThe FoA segment is highly profitable, generating $42.66 billion in operating income with an impressive operating margin of 37%. In contrast, the RL segment recorded $13.7 billion in losses. Meta has been leveraging the profitability of the FoA segment to support and develop the RL segment, aligning with its broader vision for the metaverse.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh growth, recent challenges and strategic revival\n\nOver the past decade, Meta has demonstrated consistently high revenue growth. In 2012, its revenue stood at $5 billion, soaring to nearly $118 billion by 2021, before slightly declining to $116.6 billion in 2022. The annual growth rate between 2012 and 2021 varied from 21.6% to 58.4%. However, in 2022, there was a 1.1% decrease in sales, partly attributed to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Nonetheless, on a constant currency basis, sales growth was 4% in 2022. This slowdown in sales growth mainly resulted from a global reduction in advertising spending, influenced by a sluggish global economy and rising interest rates. Additionally, challenges arose from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"app tracking transparency\" feature, which allows users to prevent apps from tracking their activities across devices.\n\nIn 2022, Meta's operating income plummeted by 38% to nearly $29 billion. This significant drop was not only due to sluggish sales growth, but also an increase in payroll and expenses related to a 20% increase in employee headcount. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nSince late 2022 and into early 2023, Meta initiated restructuring efforts to enhance its operating performance. This involved three rounds of restructuring and layoffs, particularly in recruiting and technical departments, resulting in over 20,000 job cuts. By the second quarter of 2023, Meta's workforce had been reduced to approximately 66,100 employees, a 7% decrease from the previous quarter. The 2022 restructuring led to a leaner organization and improved operating margins. Meta also leveraged artificial intelligence to boost product and business performance. AI-driven feed recommendations significantly increased user engagement, leading to a 7% rise in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram. Furthermore, Meta's Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns achieved a $10 billion run rate, with over 50% of advertisers utilizing the Advantage+Creative tool for ad optimization.\n\nAs a result of these restructuring efforts and initiatives, Meta's financial performance in the first three quarters of 2023 improved significantly. Revenue grew by 23% to $34.15 billion and operating profit surged by 145% to $13.75 billion. Consequently, the operating margin expanded remarkably from nearly 19.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 40.36% in the third quarter of 2023. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nSolid balance sheet and prudent debt management\n\nMeta possesses a robust balance sheet, characterized by effective leverage management. As of September, the company held approximately $36.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, along with $24.2 billion in marketable securities, including U.S. government and corporate debt instruments. Its long-term debt was relatively modest at $18.4 billion. This debt comprises fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, issued in August 2022 and May 2023, at favorable interest rates. The interest rates on these notesvaried from 3.50% to 5.75%. Furthermore, the maturity dates of these debts are spread out, ranging from 2027 to as far out as 2063. The principal payments for these debts are staggered, each ranging from $1 billion to a maximum of $3 billion. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nPotential upside\n\nOver the last 10 years, Meta has consistently increased its earnings per share, starting from a mere 1 cents in 2012, escalating to a peak of $13.77 in 2021 and then settling at $8.59 in 2022. Following its recent restructuring and the implementation of AI-driven initiatives, which have significantly improved its operating margin, the company is projected to achieve increased revenue and earnings per share in 2024. For 2024, it is estimated that Meta will generate approximately $150.7 billion in revenue and earnings of $17.39 per share. Over the last five years, Meta's price-earnings ratio has fluctuated between 8.65 and 37.90. Using the five-year average price-earnings ratio of 25.50, the estimated value of Meta's shares is around $443, which is nearly 24% higher than its current trading price. Meta Platforms: A Tale of Resilience and Recovery\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta Platforms' financial journey is a testament to resilience and strategic foresight in a volatile market. Despite the challenges posed by global economic shifts and technological disruptions, the company's effective restructuring, particularly in 2023, and its commitment to innovation have catalyzed a significant turnaround. The company has a strong balance sheet, a focused approach to debt management and promising projections for revenue and earnings growth. The current market valuation of Meta's stock, while robust, suggests it is undervalued.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Gen Z’s Top Picks for 2024: 7 Trending Stocks Among Young Investors",
        "content": "Gen Z stocks aren’t typical, because the generation has a unique relationship with the stock market. Just like Gen Z is the first to grow up fully immersed in digitization and the Internet culture, active market investing and trading is just another fact of life for a sizeable subset. Gen Z effectively grew up with digital investment opportunities facilitated by fractional trading and “gamified” platforms, whereas past generations had a higher barrier to investment entry. Today, more than 50% of Gen Z actively invests money in a taxable brokerage account.\n\nAnd, just as Gen Z’s approach to investing varies, so too does their collective information collection strategy. Whereas past generations looked to investment experts like paid advisors or popular figures like Warren Buffett for advice, nearly half of Gen Z uses social media as their primary investment information source, with only 30% leveraging a financial professional.\n\nThese trends make Gen Z’s favorite stocks slightly different from past generational preferences. Gen Z tends to prefer higher risk/higher reward ventures, buoyed by popular media like Wolf of Wall Street. Identifying these opportunities is one way to ride the Gen Z investing wave. Another is to seek Gen Z stocks centered on generational preferences – what products and services does Gen Z use most or have a bias towards? Anchoring a basket of Gen Z stocks in reliable companies most used by Gen Z can offset the risk associated with more speculative Gen Z stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a favorite among Gen Z investors because the company blends biotech upside opportunities with a recent winning streak that’s seen shares surge over the past few years. VRTX’s most recent win is a series of positive clinical results for an opioid alternative therapy, which sent shares more than 10% higher after the initial report.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past few years, a series of US opioid crises captured headlines and Gen Z’s collective attention. At the same time, younger generations increasingly know someone addicted to opioids and generally consider the drugs easily accessible. This outlook and experience, coupled with Gen Z’s general conscientiousness, could also contribute to the stock’s popularity among Gen Z investors.\n\nAt the same time, though Vertex is priced high, the company’s long-term potential doesn’t just lie in its opioid alternatives. The company’s strategic partnership with gene editing biotech firm Crispr Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) sets the stage for a new era in healthcare, particularly on the heels of recent successes.\n\nGen Z Stocks: Starbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) isn’t just a Millennial staple – Gen Z loves the product too. The generation’s “love of iced drinks” drove sales to record highs in recent years with little sign of slowing. Critically, Gen Z’s unique individualization creates an opportunity for Starbucks to offer customized options beyond current offerings, a fact management is leaning into. Founder Howard Schultz specifically called out the opportunity in an interview, saying, “We’re at the early stages with cold beverages in the modifiers and customization, and that gives us a competitive advantage.”\n\nOf course, Starbucks is a top Gen Z stock when it comes to hyper-personalization trends, indicating they know Gen Z demands more from their corporations. The company’s free birthday drink is one such example, but Starbucks’ app leverage creates new vistas for data harvesting that, in turn, customizes and micro-targets sales features to individual customers. The company is also using AI to streamline its Gen Z targeting efforts, indicating that the company is taking advantage of all available advertising opportunities and tech to keep Gen Z buying.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration, the Tilray Brands (TLRY) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) captures another unique Gen Z trend – a clear preference for cannabis over alcohol. Today, nearly 70% of the generation prefers marijuana rather than alcohol as their intoxicant of choice. As widespread legalization sentiment continues overthrowing state restrictions on its use, expect cannabis stocks like Tilray to surge on the heels of increased Gen Z enthusiasm.\n\nThough there are many cannabis stocks, Tilray is unique in its operational approach. Its cannabis segment, of course, appeals to Gen Z customers favoring that intoxicant over alcohol. But the firm’s inroads into the craft brewing market, typified by a recent purchase of eight brands from Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD), helps it diversify its base. That diversification sets Tilray apart from the competition in a low-margin industry with relatively few material barriers to entry. Craft beer drinkers are right in the older Gen Z/younger Millennial sweet spot, demonstrating the fact that Tilray knows its customers and is actively managing multiple acquisition strategies to capture their cash.\n\nGen Z Stocks: Walt Disney Co (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nThough Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) shares struggled recently, marking multi-year lows, Gen Z’s love for Mickey and the team creates a unique investment opportunity. More than 40% of Gen Z has a favorable opinion towards the media megalith, making today’s rock bottom pricing an ideal entry point for a potential reversal.\n\nCritically, though the platform’s not been as popular as management hoped, Disney+ effectively stays sustainable on the backs of Gen Z watchers, who comprise most of its viewership. As Disney debates its future streaming service management, including selling off ESPN, the company would be well advised to stick with what’s popular among this Gen Z customer demographic. This could likely take the form of expanded in-app live shopping services, already somewhat facilitated by Disney’s integrated shopping service. But, as Gen Z prefers shopping online to live experiences, expanding this unique sales funnel could make a huge difference for Disney investors.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nS&P 500‘s recent inducteeUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is another stock Gen Z can’t get enough of. More than half of the age demographic downloads more food delivery apps than streaming service platforms, indicating a shift in consumer behavior towards at-home digital services. Online grocery sales are booming in general, and this trend meets Gen Z’s personal shopping preferences to make Uber a top stock based on its Uber Eats platform alone.\n\nAt the same time, Gen Z is increasingly disinterested in driving or car ownership. One Gen Z member summed up the generational thesis well, saying: “I haven’t needed one to this point. If there’s an emergency, I’ll call an Uber or 911.” In many cases, Uber is synonymous with ridesharing and a verb in and of itself – indicating the company’s strength among the Gen Z set. As Uber further pivots towards self-driving cars, expect the Gen Z dislike of personal vehicles and interest in emerging tech to converge into a massive investment opportunity in Uber.\n\nGen Z Stocks: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nGen Z might not love personal vehicles, but they love Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. Tesla is consistently a name the generation points to when discussing investment potential, likely an outcome of the stock’s meteoric rise and general resiliency in recent years. The company consistently ranks within the top five stocks Gen Z investors trade most often.\n\nThough Tesla’s global market share slipped, falling behind BYD (OTCMKTS:BYD) in recent weeks, the company’s U.S. dominance is unmatched. Meanwhile, the meme-worthy Cybertruck is a staple of Internet culture, serving as an endless sales funnel as Gen Z attention fixes on the unique vehicle. Tesla has a bumpy road ahead in the short term as competition increases, regulatory oversight changes and new friction is introduced into Musk’s operational model. Still, the company’s omnipresence among Gen Z investors and consumers sets it apart as one of the few companies still securing brand loyalty today.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough Facebook itself is often derided as a gathering spot for Boomers, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a long and fruitful future ahead of itself regarding Gen Z. Though TikTok tends to capture headlines, the fact remains that Meta’s Instagram platform has greater Gen Z market penetration, at 80.9% compared to TikTok’s 71.9%.\n\nBut the real win for Meta’s Gen Z initiatives will be sticking the landing on its metaverse concept. Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse might have slowed its momentum recently, but the fact remains that some degree of VR activity will be the norm one day, and Gen Z’s digital native status positions it as an early adopter.\n\nImmersive shopping features, facilitated by a digital ecosystem, are increasingly popular among Gen Z buyers. At the same time, we’ve seen how metaverse-style fashion shows and real estate exploded before falling off due to tech limitations and accessibility concerns. But the market is there, and Meta’s metaverse might be the next juggernaut capturing the new Gen Z virtual reality economy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2023, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) staged a remarkable turnaround, surging nearly 200% after a terrible 64% decline in 2022.\n\nNotably, the company’s revival can be largely attributed to artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. This includes the launch of products like Imagine and Meta AI, along with 28 additional AI programs. They even feature influencers like Snoop Dogg and Kendall Jenner.\n\nAdditionally, the potential for a significant Federal Reserve rate cut throughout the year promised positive market implications. Further, this could include a potential boost to the company’s valuation.\n\nMeta’s strides in AI are notable, and further advancements could prompt a valuation comparable to leading AI-focused stocks. Additionally, anticipated earnings growth of approximately 21% in the coming year will likely contribute to Meta’s favorable trajectory.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) thrives as a platform empowering businesses to establish and manage online stores. Its subscription model ensures a steady income stream.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, the company marked its most successful Black Friday, with merchants raking in $4.1 billion in sales. Financially robust, Shopify recorded a 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue surge to $1.7 billion and a 36% YOY increase in gross profit. With SHOP stock surging 115% year to date (YTD), momentum could propel it going forward in the coming year.\n\nIn its most recent recent quarter, Shopify reported earnings of 31 cents per share, marking a substantial 342.9% increase from the same period last year. Additionally, quarterly revenue came in at $2.07 billion, reflecting 19% YOY growth. For the current fiscal year, earnings are estimated at 70 cents per share. This represents a remarkable 1,650% change, with revenue expected to reach $6.98 billion, a 25% change. Looking to the next fiscal year, earnings are projected at $1.04 per share, implying growth of 48%.\n\nAfter a challenging 2022, Shopify rebounded, reclaiming a $100 billion market cap. The company’s restructuring, including the sale of its logistics business, boosted investor confidence. With a leaner workforce, positive operating income, and AI opportunities, analysts anticipate 20% revenue growth, positioning Shopify as a top 2024 performer.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The logo for Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is shown on a phone screen in front of the Microsoft logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a key holding for many institutional investors including Citadel, making up nearly 2% of this asset manager’s portfolio.\n\nCitadel increased its Microsoft position by 3.67 million shares across Q2 and Q3. Specifically, it acquired 1.6 million shares in Q3 at an average closing price of $330. This strategic move bolsters confidence amid rising share prices. Also, it highlights Microsoft’s strength in AI and the cloud.\n\nThe tech behemoth surged over 260% in the past five years, rewarding shareholders with a 0.8% dividend yield and $0.75 quarterly payout. Heavy AI investments are expected to pay off, with diverse products integral to daily life. Steady 2023 net income growth is anticipated to continue. Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and its robust liquidity position, coupled with strong leadership, set the stage for future success.\n\nThus, I’m remaining bullish on MSFT stock for a number of reasons. Two reasons include the company’s entry into quantum computing and its robust ecosystem of software and hardware applications. And, the third reason is its investment in OpenAI, which makes this stock worth owning for the long-term. Indeed, for those who believe this AI rally can continue, MSFT stock is one to hold right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in META. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "U.S. and European equity markets have kicked off the new year on the backfoot, with both pulling back slightly on the second trading day of 2024 from 2023 record high closes.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down 60 points to 4,714 from its 2023 close at 1130 hrs ET on Wednesday while the Stoxx Europe 600 was also down marginally. Yields on 10-year US bonds and German bunds have also started creeping up, with the U.S. rate quoted at 3.956% as money markets wagered on the Federal Reserve cutting rates by fewer than 150 basis points in 2024.\n\nThankfully, the U.S. energy sector has started the year on a more positive note, with the sector’s benchmark Energy Select Sector Fund (XLE) up 2.1% in the first two trading days and Brent and WTI gaining over 3% on Wednesday.\n\nGrowing tensions in the  Middle East have worsened fears of oil supply disruptions after an Iranian warship entered the Red Sea and raised the specter of the conflict spilling over into the region.\n\nThe markets remain a bit edgy because of the uncertainty surrounding precisely when the Federal will start cutting rates, and also because the Fed has cautioned about the lingering possibility of a mild recession.\n\nMarket action suggests there’s an outside chance of a 25-basis-point cut at just 12.9% in January, but a much bigger 87.1% chance that the central bank will leave rates unchanged when it releases its December meeting minutes on Wednesday at 1400 hrs ET. Fed officials held the policy interest rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range at their meeting in mid-December, but signaled they would cut rates by at least 75 basis points in the current year as inflation steadily declines to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nRelated: Oil Gains Over 3% On Libya, OPEC and Middle East Escalation\n\nThat said, equity markets remain largely bullish with Principal Financial Group predicting that 2024 is setting up to be the \"year of the pivot.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n“Markets surprised to the upside in 2023, despite a host of challenges, and fought off a widely expected recession to finish the year near record highs. Looking ahead to 2024, the market rebound, combined with the Federal Reserve’s rate pause, has set the stage for a long-anticipated pivot toward rate cuts,” Principal said in an investor note.\n\nIn other words, investors are looking forward to further gains in the stock markets in 2024. The U.S. market returned just under 25% while its European peer gained 13% in 2023 amid optimism that central banks will return to a rate cut regime. Supporting the optimistic market viewpoint is the fact that headline inflation decelerated to 3.1% in November, unemployment has declined to 3.7%  while 2023 GDP growth could potentially clock in at 2.6% based on the Federal Reserve’s latest projections.\n\nSource: J.P. Morgan\n\nBut it’s not just Wall Street that’s feeling upbeat about the new year. The American Association of Individual Investors has reported an underlying shift towards a bullish position with many bearish investor viewpoints now in the rearview mirror.\n\nAccording to a year-end sentiment survey put together by the organization, 46.3% of investors are bullish on the broader market; 25.1% hold a bearish stance while 28.6% remain neutral. While the majority of investors are still either bearish or neutral, it’s important to note that the sentiment has shifted dramatically over the past two months considering that only 24.3% of individuals were bullish while 50.3% looked at the market from a bearish lens when the survey was carried out on Nov. 1.\n\nHistorical precedent also seems to favor the bulls.\n\nOn Monday, Ned Davis Research noted that the S&P 500 sat less than 1% from its all-time trading high of 4,818 that it hit on Jan. 3, 2022. The analysts have noted that the gap between those two peaks is the sixth longest between record highs, and such lengthy gaps tend to be followed by a period of outperformance.\n\n“There have been 14 cases of the S&P 500 going at least one year without an all-time high. After the record has been eclipsed, the S&P 500 has outperformed its long-term average one-, three-, six-, and 12-months later. One-month returns are not quite as strong (up 71% of the time by a median of 1.8%), suggesting a short-term overbought condition. One year later, the index has risen 13 out of 14 times by a median of 13.4%. A new high after a long stretch often marks a new stage of the bull market rather than its conclusion,’’ the analysts have noted.\n\nJanuary Selloff For Megacap Tech Stocks\n\nBut not all corners of the market are expected to remain hale and hearty; at least not in the early innings of the year. Bank of America has warned about a January \"rout\" in megacap tech stocks, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp.(NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in danger of underperforming.\n\n\"Crowding risk in the leaders of 2023 has been cited by many (including ourselves) as a key risk in 2024. In particular, year-end 'window dressing' may have pushed active funds into big Tech leaders, but these stocks could be used as a source of funds if a hard landing is avoided and leadership broadens beyond secular growth stocks,\" BofA equity strategist Savita Subramanian has said in a note.\n\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nArgentina’s New President Is Looking To Shake Up Its Oil Industry The 11 States Leading America’s Oil Production Boom What Will Influence Oil Prices in 2024?\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com",

        "content": "Published in 1996, The Millionaire Next Door remains an insightful book that offers a glimpse into the lives of people with net worth exceeding $1 million. They didn’t drive fancy cars or live in big homes. Further, they had modest lifestyles, saved money, and frequently invested their extra cash.\n\nIn fact, many of these individuals didn’t make high-risk investments. Instead, they incurred risk strategically by diversifying their portfolios and understanding their risk tolerances. Growth stocks can deliver enticing returns for long-term investors, especially if you have a 10-20 year time horizon.\n\nTherefore, investors eager to embrace The Millionaire Next Door mentality may want to consider these top growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPerion (PERI) peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerion (NASDAQ:PERI) is a small advertising company with a $1.5 billion market cap and a 13 P/E ratio. Clearly a hidden gem, it capitalizes on new advertising platforms like Connect TV and Digital Out-of-Home advertising.\n\nThe company regularly posts high revenue and earnings growth, even gaining market share in 2022. That was the year when Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) were reported year-over-year (YOY) revenue and earnings decline in some quarters.\n\nAlso, Perion thrives when advertising faces considerable headwinds and should continue on its path as tailwinds start to emerge. And, the company achieved 17% YOY revenue growth in the third quarter and expanded its profit margins. Recently, PERI launched a generative AI-powered dynamic audio advertising solution known as WAVE that gives businesses more advertising flexibility.\n\nWhile a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) influences roughly one third of Perion’s ad revenue, the company has diversified its advertising solutions. Also, it appears Perion and Microsoft won’t go their separate ways. The two companies have been working together since 2010 to deliver innovative search solutions. And just last year, Perion received the Global Supply Partner of the Year Award from Microsoft. That honor is one of many indicators that suggest the partnership will remain intact.\n\nStory continues\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a cosmetics company that offers affordable skincare and makeup products. It animal cruelty-free and vegan stance distinguishes it from the competition.\n\nImpressively, the beauty company has carved out a niche for itself and has been growing at an astounding pace. ELF reported 76% YOY revenue growth in Q2 fiscal 2024. Net income reached $33 million, which is almost triple the net income YOY.\n\nFurther, Elf Beauty has a 47 forward P/E ratio and has generated incredible returns for investors. Shares are up by 162% year to date (YTD), surging by 1,453% over the past five years! ELF has an $8 billion market cap which means the company has plenty of untapped opportunities.\n\nTruly, many of the best growth stocks revolve around tech. However, finding stocks outside of that sector can lead to portfolio diversification that doesn’t sacrifice growth.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a cybersecurity firm that offers top-tier software. It can secure any cloud, automate security operations, and respond to threats faster.\n\nJust like the other stocks on this list, Palo Alto Networks has delivered exceptional gains for long-term investors. Shares have gained 113% YTD and are up by 381% over the past five years. High net income growth is making the valuation easier to justify. Although shares trade at a 167 P/E ratio, the forward P/E is a more generous 56.\n\nNet income increased by 871% YOY in Q1 of fiscal 2024. Revenue jumped by 20% YOY, and 16% YOY growth in total billings suggests more of the same.\n\nIndeed, cyber attacks continue to increase each year which heightens the demand for Palo Alto Networks’ products and services. Annually, hackers steal millions of dollars by infiltrating databases and accessing sensitive information. The lucrative nature of hacking and the significant costs incurred during and after a cyber attack are enough to draw companies to cybersecurity software.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is one of the biggest names in cybersecurity and many clients stick around for years. Since 83% of the company’s revenue is recurring, the stock can continue to reward long-term investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in PERI and ELF.

        "content": "In this article, we present 15 best growth stocks under $25. If you want to skip our discussion on the performance of growth stocks, head directly to 5 Best Growth Stocks Under $25.\n\nThe markets have rallied for the better part of the year at the back of the US Federal Reserve, hiking interest rates to 22-year highs. The push of the benchmark rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% has helped push inflation to lows of 3.1%. On the other hand, the hikes threaten to plunge the economy into recession amid slowing economic activities.\n\nNevertheless, investors have shunned the recession concerns, betting that the bull run will continue into 2024. The S&P 500 has rallied 26.3% for the year including dividend payments, with the Nasdaq 100 following suit with a nearly 54% gain.\n\nHeading into 2024, there is a clear indication that the upward momentum will continue gathering pace amid a string of positive factors. Key among them is growing expectations that the Fed will start cutting interest rates as early as the first half of the year. While stocks rallied even as the central bank hiked in 2022, expectations are high that cuts would be a major catalyst that should fuel the upward momentum.\n\nIn addition, solid revenue growth rates and corporate earnings are other factors increasingly fueling investor’s interest rates in the market. High-growth stocks led by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) have delivered impressive revenue and earnings growth supported by a resilient economy and solid consumer spending power.\n\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has also helped strengthen investor interest in some equities. Semiconductor heavyweights led by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have been some of the biggest beneficiaries amid growing demand for their chips to power the AI push. Likewise, companies like Salesforce and Palantir integrating AI tools into their solutions have also exploded as investors take note of the massive opportunities up for grabs.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the stock market appears to lose its momentum during the first 2 trading days of 2024 as some analysts are already sounding warnings about valuations that appear to have gotten out of hand amid the blockbuster gains. The S&P 500 is priced above 30 times profits, one of the highest readings on record. There are already concerns that the overbought S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite could face major headwinds as investors start to book profits.\n\nThe Bank of England has already issued warnings reiterating that US tech stocks and dollar-denominated corporate bands appear overstretched on the valuation front. \"The overall risk environment continues to be challenging and near-term growth prospects remain subdued. Given the impact of higher interest rates, and uncertainties associated with inflation and growth, some risky asset valuations appear to be stretched,\" the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said after a quarterly meeting. 15 Best Growth Stocks Under $25\n\nA trader in an office, surrounded by financial charts and graphs, looking intently at a stock ticker.\n\nThe comments by the Bank of England come when many popular growth stocks are trading at a sharp premium to the S&P 500. The premium valuations come against the backdrop of rates sitting near record highs and fueling concerns of a potential slowdown next year. In addition, soaring geopolitical tensions also raise serious doubt about the market outlook heading into 2024.\n\nNevertheless, the best growth stocks to buy under $25 could be the answer for shrugging off the premium valuation concerns and riding the bull run into 2024. The fastest-growing quality stocks trading under $25 offer one of the best ways of diversifying an investment portfolio while eying high returns down the road.\n\nThe Fed hinting at possible rate cuts next year should be one of the catalysts likely to support the best growth stocks to buy under $25. Falling interest rates are expected to benefit such companies, given the expected reduction in borrowing costs that most companies need to support their research and development efforts. Some of the notable names likely to do well on a cut in interest rates from 22-year highs include Flywire Corp (NASDAQ:FLYW), Coursera Inc. (NYSE:COUR), and TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nOur list of the best stocks to buy under $25 includes stocks in several sectors that are expected to double their revenue over the next few years, therefore generating more shareholder value. We screened stocks under $25 with high P/E ratios (over 50) as of December 1 and picked the biggest ones in growing sectors like tech, e-commerce, solar, health information, and autos. We ranked these growth stocks by the number of hedge funds that own them, using Insider Monkey’s data of 910 top hedge funds as of Q3 2023. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Growth Stocks to Buy Under $25\n\n15.

(NASDAQ:ROVR)\n\nP/E Ratio: 99.01\n\nLatest Share Price: $10.88\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 21\n\nRover Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROVR) is a communication services company operating an online pet care marketplace worldwide. Rover Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROVR) connects pet parents with pet providers that offer overnight service, including boarding and in-home pet sitting.\n\nRover Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROVR) has been in explosive form in 2023, rallying by more than 190%, and investors are impressed by the company’s long-term prospects and growth metrics. Rover Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ROVR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Rover Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROVR) has surpassed Tech Resources to become a top 5 position in the portfolio. Rover, a pet care marketplace, is a prime example of a business that’s poised for success in virtually any economic environment. It reported a set of fantastic earnings due to which its stock gained 50% and has not given up much of that gain in the recent pullback. This is a position that has been in the portfolio since September 2022 but we added to the position as we gained conviction in the thesis.\n\nOperating as a marketplace, Rover earns a “take rate” or a kind of “toll” on every transaction occurring within its platform. In the face of inflation, as pet sitters request higher prices for their services, Rover’s revenues naturally grow because its share of the transaction value increases. In addition, Rover is a category disrupter due to which its revenue growth is likely to be much higher than the average stock – it is taking share from friends and family as well as kennels. Finally, networks like Rover get more valuable over time due to which they have to spend less to attract more users on their platform. This results in operating leverage due to which its earnings are poised to grow even faster than revenues.… ” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10. Coursera, Inc.

        "title": "The 7 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have delivered incredible returns and crushed the market over the last year -- and the trend looks poised to continue in 2024.\n\nWhile some smaller companies will undoubtedly emerge as winners, the competitive advantages granted by infrastructure and data strengths suggest the AI race will continue to favor large players.\n\nWith that in mind, investors can best position themselves to profit from the AI revolution by building positions in today's category leaders. Read on to see why investing in these resource-rich, industry-leading companies is a great way to play AI trends in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies are at the heart of the AI revolution. When it comes to the advanced GPUs used to power AI applications, data centers, and other forms of accelerated computing, the semiconductor leader controls roughly 90% of the market. The company has entered an incredible new AI-powered growth phase, and soaring demand made it the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock over the last year.\n\nIn addition to a rock-solid demand outlook for its GPUs, Nvidia is building out its software business and offering AI computing as a service. With its hardware playing a foundational role in pushing AI forward and new business initiatives looking poised to deliver additional sales growth and very strong margins, profits are on track to continue expanding rapidly.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nAI is already powering strong performance for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). This trend is most visible in the company's Azure cloud computing business, with demand for cloud infrastructure services surging as developers launch and scale AI applications. But AI stands to benefit virtually every business under Microsoft's corporate umbrella.\n\nAI is on track to power continued advances for the company's operating systems, productivity software, search business, video games unit, and other businesses. Due to the popularity of its far-reaching product and service offerings, Microsoft also has access to tons of valuable data -- data that can be used to build and improve AI systems. Thanks to the strength of its product and services ecosystem and incredible technology resources, Microsoft stands at the top of the AI software power rankings.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Palantir\n\nFounded in 2003, Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) has had a focus on machine learning and AI technologies for over two decades. Thanks to its ability to gather and analyze valuable data to produce simulations and suggest optimal courses of action, the software specialist has won major contracts with agencies within the U.S. Department of Defense and other government organizations.\n\nThe data analytics specialist has also been rapidly attracting business customers -- and its new AI technologies look poised to power accelerating growth in the private sector. Palantir launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in May 2023. By August, over 100 organizations were using the service. And by November, AIP had a customer base spanning nearly 300 distinct organizations.\n\nWhile Palantir stock has been red hot, rising roughly 160% over the last year, it's still down 57% from its high. For long-term investors, this AI growth stock has the potential to be a massive winner.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nWhile most of Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) revenue comes from its e-commerce business, the large majority of its profits come from Amazon Web Services (AWS). With demand for cloud infrastructure and other tools used to power AI applications poised to surge, Amazon could see sales growth for its most profitable business segment start to reaccelerate.\n\nBut AI will likely also power incredible improvements for the company's e-commerce business. With AI tech paving the way for increased factory automation and autonomous deliveries, margins for the online retail business could see dramatic improvements. If that happens, profits from Amazon's massive e-commerce could soar and power incredible gains for the stock.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike other top tech players, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has big advantages in AI thanks to the breadth of its software offerings and access to massive troves of valuable data. Trading at roughly 21 times expected earnings for 2024, its stock also looks like one of the best value buys in the AI space. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nBetween its market-leading search and mobile operating system (OS) technologies, fast-growing cloud infrastructure business, communication and productivity software, and YouTube streaming platform, Alphabet has many avenues to win in AI. Through its Waymo subsidiary, Alphabet is also a leader in autonomous vehicle technologies and stands to see explosive benefits as AI-powered self-driving tech evolves.\n\nWith multiple ways to profit with AI and its stock trading at non-prohibitive levels, Alphabet is a great pick for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\n\n6. CrowdStrike\n\nThe use of AI technologies to create and deploy cyberattacks could be one of this century's most disruptive trends. Thankfully, top cybersecurity companies are using advanced AI technologies to combat the rising tide of threats.\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) is arguably the leader when it comes to AI-powered cybersecurity software, and it's indisputably the leader in its corner of the market. The adaptive technologies offered through its Falcon platform help businesses and institutions prevent breaches of their networks through linked computers, mobile devices, servers, and other hardware.\n\nThe cybersecurity arms race could be one of the most important and most broadly overlooked aspects of the AI revolution. For investors looking to profit from the intersection of these world-shaping trends, CrowdStrike stands out as a top play.\n\n7. Meta Platforms\n\nAI-enhanced content feeds, ad targeting, and cost-saving efficiency initiatives are powering a major resurgence for Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). In the third quarter, the company's revenue rose 23% year over year to reach more than $34.1 billion. Earnings per share jumped 168% in the period, and the social networking leader ended the period with a staggering 3.05 billion users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other platforms.\n\nMeta should be able to score additional AI-driven wins with its content feeds and ad platforms, and it's still in the early stages of monetizing chatbots and using AI to advance its metaverse vision. With its massive global user base, data access, and deep technology resources, the company is in a good position to keep racking up long-term wins.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 11 high growth low debt stocks to buy. To skip our analysis of the recent trends, and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy.\n\nWe have discussed high growth, low debt stocks in this article which are available at attractive prices and present promising opportunities for investment. For the purpose of our article, we have chosen EPS growth as the main factor to identify high growth stocks, from a myriad of possible metrics that could have been chosen, such as revenue growth, EBITDA growth, etc. We have defined high growth company as one where analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by an average annual rate of at least 15% over the next 5 years.\n\nIn terms of low debt, we have picked companies that have debt to equity ratios lower than 0.50. Companies typically use debt to finance their operations or to acquire assets. Utilization of debt for business purposes can help a company add value if used correctly. Incorrect usage of debt, on the other hand, has the potential to destroy value. Some companies and some industries can take on more debt than others depending on the fundamentals.\n\nLow debt on balance sheets bodes well for the future possibility of the company remaining operational through existing financial resources as well as a comparatively greater ability to raise debt, if required, in the future at competitive rates. These companies are also better off in periods of economic downturn as they have low financial obligations to meet.\n\nAnother important factor that we have considered for our selection of stocks for this list pertains to the competitive advantage of the stocks we have picked. Competitive advantages require time to be developed and honed and require excellence ranging from product development to strategy execution and marketing and distribution.\n\nTypically, stocks can have two kinds of competitive advantages in terms of the longevity of the advantages. Wide moat companies –likely to sustain their competitive advantage for at least the next 20 years; and narrow moat companies – more likely than not to sustain their competitive advantage for at least 10 years into the future. The Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index is an index that focuses on companies with wide moat ratings trading at the lowest current market price, according to Morningstar Equity Research team. The index generated a total return of 22.75% in 2023 and an annual return of 13.13% during the last 10 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe United States stock market continues to rally with optimism related to interest rates. Investor confidence has been on an upward trajectory since the end of October following optimism about interest rates policies. On November 28, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said that he’s “increasingly confident” that the monetary policy is in the right place to bring inflation down to 2%. Major stock indices have posted consecutive weeks of positive performance with the S&P 500 slated to have one of its best months since July 2022. You can read more about the recent interest rate cuts which have led to the latest rally in the stock markets here. High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy\n\nA panoramic view of a busy stock exchange floor, filled with traders analyzing the market.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of 11 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy, we chose 11 stocks with competitive advantages that have an estimated average annual EPS growth rate of over 15% a year for the next 5 years according to FINVIZ.com. We filtered the stocks based on stocks that had less than a debt to equity ratio of 0.5. EPS Next 5 Year Ratio is the estimated average annual EPS growth rate in the next 5 years.\n\nFor each stock, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) announced the acquisition of PikeTec GmbH, a leading solutions provider for the testing and verification of automotive software for control unit systems. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nAs of Q3 2023, Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) shares were owned by 57 hedge funds with a total value of $2.6 billion. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners was the largest hedge fund shareholder with ownership of 1.1 million shares valued at $511 million.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC, an investment advisor, made the following comments about Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS):\n\n“Synopsys contributed to performance in the quarter as the company reported third quarter revenues that were above consensus, additionally the company raised fiscal year guidance for 2023.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares to $166 from $152 and maintained a ‘Buy’ rating.\n\nThis is what Wedgewood Partners, an investment management company, had to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet was a top contributor to performance as search revenues accelerated during their second quarter. This improved performance flies in the face of fears that demand for the Company's advertising inventory and core search functionality would be diluted by the Company's own generative-AI offerings and outside substitutes. Alphabet subsidiaries have been at the vanguard of artificial intelligence for more than a decade. The Company has spent almost $150 billion on research and development over just the past five years, and today over 80% of the Company's advertising customers use an AI-enabled tool when they run their Google Search and YouTube campaigns. Thus, Alphabet is certainly not \"behind the curve\" in any way, shape, or form when it comes to AI. Quite the contrary, the Company has ample room to rationalize spending to drive better returns on investments and increase capital returns to shareholders at these relatively attractive forward earnings multiples.”\n\n7.

Hence, metaverse stocks are likely to reap substantial benefits from this surge.\n\nAdditionally, the economy’s strong performance boosts metaverse stocks. Increased disposable income is channeling more investments into innovative technologies and virtual experiences. The metaverse envisioned as a virtual realm where users interact through digital twins, is set to blend business with leisure, complementing our physical reality. In this environment, three exceptional Metaverse stocks stand poised for significant growth, offering investors a gateway to this rapidly evolving digital transformation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept.

Its commitment to innovation has not only fueled its growth but also expanded its influence across the tech sector. Their cutting-edge technology is crucial for generating the immersive 3D spaces integral to the metaverse, positioning Nvidia as a key player in this emerging field.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia’s strategic collaborations, particularly with Microsoft’s Azure, demonstrate a focused effort to broaden its reach in cloud-based AI solutions. These partnerships aim to create comprehensive, enterprise-grade offerings, further solidifying the company’s position as a leader in tech innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, Nvidia’s third-quarter results are remarkable. The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.02, exceeding expectations by 63 cents, and a revenue surge to $18.12 billion, up 205.6% year-over-year. A record Data Center revenue of $14.51 billion, up 41% from the previous quarter, further demonstrates NVIDIA’s strong market presence and consistent financial performance.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen.

Thanks to its sizeable investment in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), Meta has firmly established itself as a frontrunner in the metaverse realm. This strategic focus has propelled the stock to an impressive 184% surge year-to-date, highlighting its market dominance and potential.\n\nOne of Meta’s notable innovations is “Imagine,” a text-to-image tool designed for creators on its social media platforms. While currently focused on social media, “Imagine” aligns seamlessly with Meta’s broader metaverse ambitions, hinting at future integration. Furthermore, Oculus headset is pivotal in Meta Platforms’ metaverse ambitions. Acquired in 2014, Oculus bolsters Meta’s VR capabilities, critical in the creation of immersive online experiences. Despite the headwinds, Oculus sales are remarkably impressive, with more than 20 million VR headset sold.\n\nMeta Platforms’ recent financial performance further solidifies its leading position. The company reported GAAP earnings per share of $4.39, exceeding expectations by 76 cents, and a revenue increase of 23.2% year-over-year to $34.15 billion, outperforming predictions by $700 million. With shares up by 4%, Meta’s momentum appears unstoppable, making it an essential stock for investors exploring the metaverse.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuilding the metaverse requires significant financial resources, often beyond the reach of mid-cap companies. However, Unity Software (NYSE:U) breaks this mold. As a mid-cap firm, it’s uniquely positioned to make a significant impact in the metaverse, particularly with its plans to enable virtual try-ons for clothes and accessories through realistic VR models, signaling a new era in online shopping.\n\nUnity Software’s platform is a game-changer, enabling developers to create interactive 2D and 3D environments. Originally focused on gaming, this technology has significant potential for the ongoing development of the metaverse. Despite a recent dip following its quarterly report, which showed a third-quarter earnings loss of 32 cents per share but a positive free cash flow of $104 million, Unity’s trajectory in the metaverse remains promising.\n\nReinforcing its metaverse commitment, Unity’s strategic acquisition of Parsec, a cloud gaming and streaming firm, enhances Unity’s capabilities, positioning it as a burgeoning force in the metaverse arena.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Down 77% from Highs, Can Coupang Stock (NYSE:CPNG) Recover in 2024?",
        "content": "While the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index (NDX) surged 43% in 2023, many of these gains were driven by mega-cap stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, e-commerce stocks such as Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) trailed the broader markets. CPNG stock rose “just” 10% in 2023 and is 77% below its all-time high. While Coupang has underperformed since its 2021 IPO, I’m bullish on the stock for 2024 due to its expanding addressable market, strong revenue growth, and improving profit margin.\n\nAn Overview of Coupang\n\nCoupang is a South Korea-based e-commerce company. It has two primary business segments, including Product Commerce and Developing Offerings. Coupang sells various products and services across categories such as home goods, apparel, beauty, home goods, electronics, and more.\n\nAdditionally, Coupang offers Rocket Fresh, a grocery delivery platform, while Coupang Eats provides restaurant ordering and delivery services. The tech company also has Coupang Play, an online content streaming platform.\n\nIn order to boost customer engagement rates, Coupang has invested heavily in infrastructure and technology. It has built more than 100 fulfillment centers spanning roughly 50 million square feet, housing millions of products. Coupang emphasized that 70% of the Korean population lives within seven miles of a Coupang logistics center.\n\nThe company now aims to leverage its capabilities in artificial intelligence and machine learning to better predict consumer demand, enabling it to deploy products across its network of fulfillment centers. Coupang is also banking on technology to dynamically route hundreds of millions of orders efficiently.\n\nHow Were Coupang’s Recent Q3 Results?\n\nDespite a challenging macro environment in 2023, Coupang increased its net revenues by 21% year-over-year to $6.2 billion in Q3. Further, the number of active customers on the Coupang platform grew by 14% to 20.4 million in the quarter. Comparatively, its gross profits rose by 27% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, indicating a margin of 25.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoupang ended the September quarter with an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $239 million, indicating a margin of 3.9%. In the last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA stood at $991 million, as it improved margins by 490 basis points.\n\nUnlike several other e-commerce tech stocks, Coupang has been reporting positive cash flows consistently. In the last four quarters, Coupang’s operating cash flow stood at $2.6 billion, while free cash flow was $1.9 billion, indicating that the company spent $700 million in capital expenditures.\n\nIn the year-ago period, Coupang reported an operating cash outflow of $200 million, while its free cash outflow was much higher at $1 billion.\n\nCoupang stated that its revenue and active customer growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter in Q3, as its Developing Offerings generated 40% revenue growth in the quarter. Moreover, Coupang expanded Rocket Delivery in Taiwan and helped around 12,000 small businesses to export products to new markets in the last 12 months.\n\nDuring the company’s recent earnings call, CEO Gaurav Anand stated, “We’ve expanded profitability while making investments in Developing Offerings, and we expect our consolidated margin to continue its march upwards on an annual basis.”\n\nCoupang Acquires Farfetch\n\nLast month, Coupang announced the acquisition of Farfetch Holdings, an online luxury company. The acquisition positions Coupang as a leader in the global personal luxury goods segment valued at $400 billion.\n\nCoupang believes its operational excellence and innovative logistics network, combined with Farfetch’s widening ecosystem in the luxury market, should help it drive experiences for customers and brands globally.\n\nAlternatively, the acquisition of Farfetch might strain Coupang’s balance sheet. In the first six months of 2023, Farfetch lost over $440 million while sales stood at $1.1 billion.\n\nThe acquisition agreement will provide Farfetch with $500 million of capital, shoring up the company’s liquidity in the near term.\n\nIs Coupang Stock Undervalued?\n\nAnalysts tracking Coupang stock expect its sales to rise by 17% to $24.08 billion for 2023 and by 13.3% to $27.27 billion for full-year 2024. Comparatively, it is forecast to end 2024 with adjusted earnings of $0.44 per share compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 expected for 2023.\n\nSo, priced at 1.2x forward sales and 37.1x 2024 earnings, CPNG stock is not too expensive, given its growth estimates.\n\nHowever, there is a good chance that the acquisition of Farfetch might result in lower profit margins for the e-commerce player. Nonetheless, Coupang ended Q3 with $4.9 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in debt, providing it with enough liquidity to navigate the current macro environment and acquire Farfetch.\n\nIs CPNG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOut of the six analysts covering CPNG stock, two recommend a Buy, three recommend a Hold, and one recommends a Sell. The average CPNG stock price target is $19.52, which is 24.1% above the current price.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nCoupang is among the largest e-commerce companies in South Korea, and it will gain access to several other markets once the acquisition of Farfetch is closed. I expect the stock to gain momentum in the next 12 months, especially if it can successfully integrate Farfetch and benefit from operational synergies as well as stable profit margins.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks have been top performers in the market. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) blowout earnings brought more attention to the space and created a gold rush of sorts. While many AI stocks have been scorching hot, investors have to discern the winners from the richly valued investments.\n\nThe best AI stocks can continue to deliver robust gains in the years ahead. High gains in the past do not indicate a stock is overvalued. Pinpoint stocks with reasonable valuations and robust financial growth can strengthen your portfolio.\n\nInvestors looking for exposure to AI stocks may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoursera (COUR) The app page for Coursera is displayed on a smartphone screen with a website in the background.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoursera (NYSE:COUR) is an online education platform that features thousands of online courses from universities, corporations, and other entities. Students can receive degrees, certifications, and other accolades for completing courses on the platform.\n\nCoursera uses artificial intelligence to make training course recommendations and help students finish the material. In fact, the company makes money from a monthly subscription and by receiving a percentage of tuition payments processed on its platform. They collaborate with over 300 leading universities and companies to give students many choices.\n\nA poorly timed IPO makes the stock gains look unimpressive over the past five years. Specifically, the company went public in 2021 when many tech companies hit their peak. However, shares rallied by over 50% in 2023. A 21% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase in the third quarter contributed to the stock’s outperformance.\n\nCollege enrollments have been declining as more people question whether college is necessary and if student debt is worth it. Although enrollments are decreasing, students still need ways to learn. If this trend continues, Coursera stands to benefit as students get online degrees and certifications to save money.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) offers cloud networking services and hardware for large data centers. These centers will become more plentiful and take on higher workloads due to artificial intelligence. The company’s two largest customers are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nAs tech giants increase their data spending, Arista Networks stands to gain. AI will keep the money coming in and help the company post enticing revenue numbers for investors.\n\nThe company reported 28.3% YOY revenue growth in Q3 and 54% YOY net income growth. In fact, ANET’s net profit margin exceeded 35% for the quarter.\n\nThe stock trades at a 32 forward P/E ratio which means it depends on continued revenue and earnings growth to justify the valuation. ANET has been a consistent top performer, which reflects the company’s ability to generate strong financials each year. Shares almost doubled in 2023 and are up by 365% over the past five years.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights.

Also, the company’s products generate demand from 5G and cloud companies.\n\nAdditionally, the stock has outperformed the market and more than tripled in 2023. Shares are up by more than 1,700% over the past five years. Supermicro is a profitable enterprise that closed Q3 with $530 million in cash and cash equivalents. Further, revenue jumped by 14% YOY, while net income experienced a YOY decline. However, the company proceeded to raise its fiscal 2024 outlook from $10 billion to $11 billion in revenue.\n\nThus, Supermicro’s growth days seem ready to continue. Leadership anticipates $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion in sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. In comparison, the company generated $1.8 billion in revenue during the Q2 of fiscal 2023.

        "title": "Wall Street’s 7 Favorite Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "As we enter 2024, it’s wise to pause and reevaluate your investment portfolio, shaking things up for the year ahead. With each new year comes shifting sentiment on Wall Street. However, many top-performing stocks from 2023 could continue gaining momentum this year. Tracking which companies analysts are most bullish on provides useful insight for investors with medium-term investing time horizons.\n\nBig tech stocks often land on analysts’ buy lists, some after already appreciating significantly. While these familiar names may not make you an overnight millionaire, they should anchor your portfolio. I’ll spotlight seven stocks that Wall Street analysts have tagged as hot buys for 2024 based on positive ratings. Note, a reminder: analyst ratings aren’t foolproof market prophecies. However, they do offer a valuable peek into current Wall Street perspectives.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s dive in!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the top dog in the e-commerce sector by a wide margin, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remains analysts’ darling pick in this space for 2024. With a stellar 42 “buy” ratings against zero “hold” or “sell” ratings over the last three months, Wall Street is extremely bullish on AMZN stock. I know some may balk at Amazon’s seemingly steep valuation. But with online shopping becoming more ingrained for the consumer (especially among digital-native Gen Zers), I’m willing to pay a premium for this proven winner.\n\nStatistaforecasts nearly 11% annualized global e-commerce growth through 2027, and Amazon should capture much of those dollars. The company’s earnings per share are estimated to grow from $2.69 in 2023 to more than $11.30 by 2032. To me, that long-term profit trajectory justifies Amazon’s current market value, and then some. Paired with low double-digit sales growth expected through 2029, I see ample upside ahead.\n\nBetween Gen Z’s digital preferences and the overall momentum of e-commerce, Amazon’s pole position in this space should equate to big returns over time. This tech titan remains as hungry as ever – a terrific stock to own in 2024 and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlashback to mid-2022 when Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) crashed to $90 per share. Despite the prevalent bearishness at the time, I stayed bullish on this company based on Meta’s rock-solid core business. Fast forward 18 months, and META stock is now trading around $346 per share.\n\nWall Street sees blue skies ahead as well. In fact, Meta nets 36 “buy” recommendations against just one “hold.” From 2023 to 2028, the company’s earnings per share could double on the back of still-robust double-digit annual revenue growth. Indeed, lingering anxiety over Meta’s metaverse dreams has proven temporary. The company’s “Family of Apps” division, not virtual reality, is Meta’s cash cow, and that business is doing just fine.\n\nMeta’s coffers will continue to grow so long as eyeballs remain glued to Facebook and Instagram. Consider Generation Z: though often portrayed as generally being “over” Facebook, most in these age groups still have an account. Additionally, Instagram remains wildly popular with teens. As long as users show up, advertisers will, too. With ample room for untapped global growth, Meta has plenty of upside left.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) retains its spot as a darling among Wall Street analysts, and for good reason. This tech titan scarcely flinched during the recent overall market slide and has rebounded forcefully to fresh highs. While Microsoft’s impressive AI initiatives capture tremendous fanfare, we can’t ignore its breadth across cloud, software, and hardware.\n\nLook no further than Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing segment, for instance. Azure’s revenue popped 29% last quarter. Thus, Microsoft is now encroaching on Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) turf via fledgling search and browser initiatives.\n\nNotably, MSFT stock also has 36 “buy” ratings against just one “hold,” with Wall Street remaining keen on Microsoft, as I am. This company has its hands in so many cookie jars (AI is just one example) that I expect substantial growth ahead. Buckle up for the ride!\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) The Uber logo is displayed on a smartphone on top of a map background.\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of software’s biggest recent success stories, Uber (NYSE:UBER) has surged to new all-time highs in recent weeks. Propelled by robust momentum and an impeccable balance sheet, Uber certainly looks like a juggernaut in the making. It’s no shock that Uber earns 35 resounding “buy” ratings among analysts against just one lone “hold” rating.\n\nNo doubt, Uber’s growth trajectory impresses mightily. The company’s earnings per share could leap from $1.15 in 2024 all the way to $6.61 in 2032, if growth remains on track. However, with 2024 earnings putting Uber’s forward price-to-earnings ratio above 53-times, I concur with that solitary “hold” rating. Despite turbocharged profit growth expected ahead, today’s rich valuation gives me reason to pause. Uber’s forward multiple will sink to around 9-times if everything goes perfectly based on 2032 income projections. But paying upfront for these earnings means investors are forced to assume some pretty significant risk.\n\nUnlike entrenched tech titans, Uber operates within the concentrated rideshare niche and is still working toward mainstream adoption. I believe waiting for a better entry point seems to be the smart play before biting on a stock trading at over 9-times potential 2032 earnings today. Long-term bulls may toss aside my caution and buy regardless, and that I think is not a bad idea if you want to hold for decades.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nLooking back to March 2023 when I first touted CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), its blistering growth metrics were undoubtedly mouthwatering. But with its valuation now stretching beyond 85-times forward earnings and 20-times forward sales, I’m balking – even with CrowdStrike garnering 34 “buy” recommendations against just 2 “hold” ratings from Wall Street analysts.\n\nWithout question, cybersecurity industry tailwinds should continue to propel CrowdStrike to new heights over this coming decade. However, paying today’s extremely steep premium seems awfully hard to justify when even the most optimistic 2033 revenue projections still put CRWD stock at almost 3-times next year’s sales. Only the most eager bulls could try rationalizing buying at such current nosebleed levels.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike CrowdStrike, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to bake highly optimistic growth assumptions into its currently lofty valuation. Sure, Nvidia has knocked recent quarterly earnings reports out of the park. But looking ahead, risks definitely loom large, both from AI chipmaking rivals rapidly narrowing the technology gap along with uncertainty permeating the still-emerging and largely unprofitable AI landscape overall.\n\nI believe Wall Street largely overestimates Nvidia’s future prospects, while seriously discounting the competitive and industry headwinds that could plausibly dampen growth. Nvidia earns an overwhelmingly positive 31 “buy” ratings against three mere “hold” ratings. Analysts clearly envisage blue skies dominating ahead. I respectfully disagree with that upbeat prognosis, and suggest prospective investors wait for a better entry point before jumping aboard.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) falls into the same frothy camp. This company has posted stellar market-beating performance in previous quarters, and holds a leadership position in the cybersecurity space. However, PANW stock appears to be priced to sheer perfection. Especially compared to high-flying cybersecurity peer CrowdStrike, Palo Alto’s top-line growth metrics look rather pedestrian moving forward. Yet, PANW stock still trades at remarkably rich earnings multiples, even when looking at 2033 projections.\n\nWith 30 “buy” ratings against just 4 “hold” ratings, Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly endorse Palo Alto Networks. However, I believe waiting for an inevitable pullback should deliver much better risk-reward upside for investors not currently holding this stock. I’d personally replace these cybersecurity picks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) if it weren’t for my basing these picks purely using Wall Street ratings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Other accessories, like the Quest 2 Carrying Case, Active Pack, and Fit Pack, are also discounted at $44.99, $59.99, and $39.99, respectively.\n\nAlso Read:Amazon Echo Frames vs. Meta's Ray-Ban: Exploring the Latest in Smart Glasses for Everyday Americans\n\nQuest's virtual reality headsets are experiencing lower sales during this bustling shopping period. A key factor contributing to this trend is shoppers' hesitation to try on the headsets in stores.\n\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, shoppers particularly shunned these headsets, known for accumulating dirt and potentially disrupting makeup.\n\nDespite Meta's attempts to regularly clean them, many customers remained wary.\n\nBefore this, in July 2022, Meta had increased the Quest 2 headset's price by $100, from $299.99 to $399.99.\n\nHowever, in June, concurrent with the announcement of the Quest 3, Meta dropped the Quest 2's price back to its original $299.99, likely to encourage more sales.\n\nMeta's VR platform offers an extensive library of over 500 games, further bolstered by a significant deal last year that brought Roblox Corp (NYSE: RBLX) to the Quest headset via the Meta Quest Store.\n\nWith the price drop of the Quest 2, Meta aims to attract consumers to VR, presenting it as a more affordable alternative to the $500 Quest 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Action: META shares traded lower by 1.31% at $349.31 on the last check Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:Meta's AI Innovations and Revenue Surge Bolster Confidence, Analyst Sees 30% Upside\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Meta's Quest 2 VR Headset Gets a Permanent Price Slash: Dive into Virtual Reality for Less originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "7 Megatrend Stocks to Buy for a Mighty Start to 2024",
        "content": "2024 promises to be a lucrative year in the stock market for many reasons. First of all, the Federal Reserve is on track to begin easing off in its efforts to cool an overheated economy. Interest rates are set to decrease with multiple projected cuts on the horizon.\n\nBeyond that though, the world continues to evolve at a rapid pace with multiple megatrends promising to galvanize strong growth. Perhaps none is more salient and influential than artificial intelligence. However there are many other trends to consider including sustainability, mobility, demographics, geopolitics and more. The biggest trends, the so-called megatrends, are particularly worth paying attention to.\n\nJoby Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA recent article in Forbes demonstrates why investors should be inherently interested in Joby Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) and its stock. The article paints a picture of an airline passenger who has just disembarked from a Hypersonic flight taking 2 hours from New York to London. That passenger then jumps into an urban air mobility drone, avoiding rush hour traffic, and arrives home in 20 minutes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUrban air mobility has emerged as one of the megatrends to pay attention to in 2023. Firms including Joby Aviation are developing electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) at a rapid pace. These firms have established strong relationships with airline companies, Joby with Delta (NYSE:DAL), that promise to revolutionize commercial flight.\n\nThe company undertook exhibition flights in New York City in November. The company expects to drastically decrease the time required to and from major airports in the area. For example, it anticipates that a flight to JFK from the surrounding boroughs will decline from 1 hour to 7 minutes. Joby Aviation continues to demonstrate the volume potential of its operations at airports. Joby recently demonstrated that it would be possible to operate 120 flights per hour in and out of busy airports.\n\nStory continues\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Is another stock to consider that leverages the drastic changes occurring across the field of mobility. Electric vehicles continue to displace internal combustion engine vehicles although their growth has not been linear. I am, of course, referring to the recent collapse in lithium prices and EV sales.\n\nIn short, the electrification of vehicles is not going to stop. EV adoption is still relatively early overall but investors should rest assured the industry is not dying. Lithium did however face a steep price correction in 2023 that saw prices decline by 80%. However with every decline there is always a chance of rebound. Current expectations are that the rebound in lithium prices will begin either in 2024 or perhaps 2025.\n\nThat coincides quite well with Lithium Americas and its future production plans. The company owns the rights to Thacker Pass which is the largest lithium deposit in the Western hemisphere. Lithium Americas commenced construction in June of this year and anticipates lithium mining operations to start sometime in 2026. It isn’t hyperbolic to suggest that investing in Lithium Americas could produce 10x returns.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could pop up on any megatrend stock list for a number of reasons. The company is intimately connected with all things technological being that it is the leading producer of the most in-demand chips. Primarily though, Nvidia promises to provide a strong start to 2024 because of artificial intelligence.\n\nOf course, artificial intelligence is a megatrend that has taken off in 2023. Its rapid emergence has turned Nvidia into an even more important company. As strong as Nvidia’s performance has been in 2023, 2024 appears to be just as strong. The analysts covering Nvidia’s shares anticipate that prices could rise by 50% again, if not more.\n\nNvidia has cornered the market for AI chips and demand for its h100 chips has been staggering. That said, the company is expected to launch its updated h200 chips in 2024 that promise to further consolidate its lead over the AI field.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has to be the other stock to consider in relation to the artificial intelligence megatrend. While the company continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia, it has emerged as a legitimate competitor.\n\nBack in mid-November the company announced an event to introduce its MI300 GPU accelerator. Then, weeks later, in early December the company released the new chips which will be available in 2024. The news has sent AMD shares from just below $100 to nearly $150 as I write this.\n\nIt has become clear that major companies are very interested in AMD’s chips for their application to artificial intelligence. Major purchasers including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have noted that they are willing to switch from Nvidia’s h100 chips to AMD’s mi300 chips once they are available. The news is a clear indication that major tech firms believe in AMD and are also frustrated with Nvidia for its pricing. Overall though, it’s a strong indication that AMD is going to remain as a potent challenger in the AI conversation.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another important tech company that touches on many of the megatrends of the near future. The stock is a wise choice for many reasons including its stability and dividend as well as its relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nFor the purposes of this conversation though, I’ll be talking about Qualcomm in relation to its 5G business. 5G is one of the mega trends that has emerged over the past few years. It promises to rapidly increase the speed of communication and the degree of connectivity. The push toward greater and greater connectivity is not going to slow and it is estimated that $20,000 satellites will be launched this decade in order to facilitate that increased connectivity.\n\nQualcomm notes that 5G is imperative for the Continue development of the digital economy. In fact, the company believes that the overall value associated with 5G will exceed $13 trillion by 2035.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) Has emerged as the company that is most closely associated with the development of quantum computing. Quantum computing is a nascent technology that promises to fundamentally change computing overall. The field leverages quantum mechanics to solve problems that are too complex for current classical computers to solve.\n\nQuantum computing is an incredibly complex field and those who would like to learn more about it should do so through this link.\n\nThe important thing to understand for the layman investor like myself is that IBM is the leader in quantum computing. Thus, if any company is best positioned to take advantage of this megatrend, IBM is it.\n\nIBM’s industry-best qubit count is expected to more than quadruple by 2025. The company is developing quantum computing hardware as well as software including the cloud-based quantum computing services. If quantum computing lives up to its billing then IBM can grow rapidly. For now, current investors can get a dividend that yields more than 4% making IBM shares attractive for income investors and those looking for future growth.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) often enters discussions that relate to e-commerce and fintech stocks. It’s probably the clearest example of a company that is showing strong results in both regards. The company has emerged as the dominant force in Latin American e-commerce and created a strong, rapidly growing payments platform in the process.\n\nMercadoLibre’s results in that regard are incredibly impressive. During the third quarter, revenues increased by more than 69%, reaching $3.8 billion. Meanwhile, gross payment volume grew by 121% to $47.3 billion. And while Mercado Libre deserves recognition for those results, there are other megatrends that I want to focus on.\n\nInstead, it is the megatrend of emerging markets. Economists continue to note that emerging markets have vast untapped potential. World superpowers including the United States and China face significant problems which has led investors to look at emerging markets with a greater focus. Thus, firms like MercadoLibre are well positioned due to their exposure to the emerging market trend as well as those in fintech and commerce.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Magnificent Seven stocks have dominated the stock market this year, driving the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index's over 43% year-to-date gains.\n\nThe large-cap tech stocks mainly banked on the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector and the growing popularity of the metaverse. AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock this year, gaining over 234% year to date. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is close behind with over 193% gains over the same period.\n\nWith immense upside over the past year, many experts speculate the tech behemoths have peaked. With recession fears looming for 2024, diversifying outside of big tech can hedge investors' portfolios in the event of a market downturn.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio.\n\nAs of Dec. 4, the recession probability model from the New York Federal Reserve indicates a 51.8% likelihood of a U.S. recession occurring within the next 12 months.\n\nIrrespective of the concerning market backdrop, analysts are bullish on these large-cap stocks in the near term.\n\nSpotify\n\nUp over 140% year-to-date, Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) is one of the biggest music streaming companies in the world.\n\nSpotify enjoys strong financials, as its total monthly active users increased 26% year over year to 574 million in the fiscal third quarter ended Sept. 30. The company's revenue increased 11% year over year to €3.36 billion ($3.7 billion). Operating income came in at €32 million, compared to a loss of €228 million reported in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company slashed its workforce by 17% earlier this month, which is expected to reduce its operating expenses by roughly 2% in fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Over the last two years, we've put significant emphasis on building Spotify into a truly great and sustainable business — one designed to achieve our goal of being the world's leading audio company and one that will consistently drive profitability and growth into the future,\" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said. \"While we've made worthy strides, as I've shared many times, we still have work to do. Economic growth has slowed dramatically, and capital has become more expensive. Spotify is not an exception to these realities.\"\n\nAnalysts expect Spotify's revenue to rise by 17.3% year over year to $17.21 billion in fiscal 2024. In addition, Wall Street predicts Spotify's earnings per share (EPS) to be $2.05 next year.\n\nPivotal Research recently upgraded its rating on Spotify stock from Hold to Buy, with a price target of $265, indicating a potential upside of over 39%. Rosenblatt Securities also upgraded its outlook on Spotify to Buy, with a price target of $300, which reflects a price target of over 58%.\n\nAnheuser-Busch\n\nAnheuser-Busch Inbev SA (NYSE:BUD) was caught up in a major controversy earlier this year when transgender publicist Dylan Mulvaney promoted Bud Light beer through her Instagram account, angering conservative consumers. Anheuser-Busch, the largest beer manufacturer in the U.S., reported a sharp decline in sales in the third quarter as the controversy intensified amid a nationwide boycott from conservatives.\n\nThe company has taken steps to improve its consumer rankings by rebranding its packages.\n\n\"We recognize that over the last two months, the discussion surrounding our company and Bud Light has moved away from beer, and this has impacted our consumers, our business partners and our employees,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are a beer company, and beer is for everyone.\"\n\nAnheuser-Busch shares have recovered, rising by over 14% over the past three months. JPMorgan expects this momentum to continue, as the financial institution has an Overweight rating on Anheuser-Busch stock with a price target of $79, reflecting a 22.5% potential upside.\n\nRestaurant Brands International\n\nRestaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) is one of the largest restaurant companies in the world, with 2022 sales of about $39 billion at nearly 30,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.\n\nThe company manages popular beverage and fast food chains such as Tim Hortons, Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. As the holiday sales kick in, Restaurant Brands' revenue is expected to rise 7.1% year over year in the quarter that ends in December.\n\nRBC Capital has an Outperform on Restaurant Brands stock with a price target of $87, indicating a potential upside of nearly 12.4% from the current price. BMO also has an Outperform rating on Restaurant Brands with a price target of $85, indicating a potential upside of over 9% from the current price.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "title": "2024’s Power Players: 7 Stocks Racing to a Trillion Valuation",
        "content": "As it stands now, six U.S.-listed stocks are in the “trillion dollar club,” or stocks with a market cap of at least $1 trillion. In the coming year, or in the years ahead, which other mega-cap stocks (stocks with a market cap of $200 billion or more) will join them and become the next trillion-dollar companies?\n\nThat’s a question on the minds of many investors. Technological breakthroughs in areas like artificial intelligence and electric vehicles point to several companies “joining the club.”\n\nSo, too, do breakthroughs/long-term trends in other areas, like healthcare and financial services. There are also mega-cap companies that, while growing at only a moderate pace, are within reach of hitting the trillion-dollar mark within this decade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, let’s take a look at seven companies that appear most likely to become trillion-dollar stocks and when exactly each of them can reach this milestone.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) What to Expect From AMD Stock Ahead of July's Earnings Report\n\nSource: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to the next chip stock to join Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the trillion dollar club, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a name that to many may first come to mind. Yet, while the chip designer is currently making its own big moves in AI chips, reaching a $1 trillion market cap may be easier said than done.\n\nAMD stock currently has a market cap of around $236 billion. Hence, shares need to surge more than fourfold to join the trillion-dollar club. With AMD rising eightfold over the past five years, quadrupling in price should be a cinch, right?\n\nNot necessarily. Due to this year’s ‘AI mania,’ AMD’s AI catalyst appears to be priced in and then some. Unless the company’s AI endeavors result in earnings many times that of current estimates, even reaching trillion-dollar status by 2030 may be, at best, a stretch.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD may not be on the fast track to becoming one of the next trillion-dollar companies, but another semiconductor firm might be. It is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Why? AVGO is already more than halfway there, with a market cap of $527.2 billion.\n\nFurthermore, as argued previously, AVGO stock may have a far greater runway than other top AI stocks. Valuation is a big reason for this. AVGO trades at a forward multiple in the low 20s. “Magnificent Seven” AI stocks trade for 30-40 times forward earnings.\n\nAlso, Broadcom could eke out billions in cost/growth synergies from its recent VMware merger, enabling the company to beat current earnings growth expectations. To reach a $1 trillion market cap, all AVGO needs to do is rise in value by just under 90%. A mix of multiple expansion and earnings growth could get it there sooner than you think.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) logo, stock trade and chart on smartphone. Business and finance market.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), legendary investor Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle, is even closer than AVGO to reaching the trillion-dollar threshold. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate currently has a market cap of $777.9 billion.\n\nThis means all BRK.A/BRK.B stock needs to do is rise by 28.5% to achieve this valuation goal. Given the mostly “old economy” nature of Berkshire and its various businesses/holdings, not to mention its huge size, you may think that reaching a trillion is, at best, several years away for the company.\n\nHowever, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued, the “road to $1 trillion” may not be as long as it seems. Per the commentator, even if growth among Berkshire’s businesses screeched to a halt, adding these stagnant cash flows to the company’s war chest would still justify a move to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nAdmittedly, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) may be the most questionable candidate to become one of the next trillion-dollar companies. Shares in the big pharma firm have surged to a valuation of $522.4 billion thanks to the massive potential of its drug candidate, Zepbound.\n\nWhile initially developed as a treatment for diabetes under the Mounjaro name, Eli Lilly has been working to get Zepbound approved as an obesity treatment. Given Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) success with its Ozempic/Wegovy obesity treatment, it’s no surprise that Wall Street is very bullish on LLY stock.\n\nYet while further positive news regarding Mounjaro/Zepbound may lead to further gains for LLY, with shares trading for 88.4 times earnings, one can argue that the future growth potential of this and other obesity treatments is already priced into the stock. Hence, you may want to tread carefully with this trillion-dollar contender.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The META backed Threads app as a compelling alternative to Twitter. Social media application technology concept.\n\nSource: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a market cap of $919.7 billion, it may be a matter of months, not years, before Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) becomes one of the next trillion-dollar stocks. In fact, as I argued recently, shares in the Facebook and Instagram parent could climb to a value well above $1 trillion during 2024.\n\nPut simply, a combination of earnings growth, further progress with the company’s AI efforts, plus greater appreciation of Meta’s AI bona fides could result in META stock (at around $360 per share today) rallying to $500 or $600 per share.\n\nIn other words, it’s within the realm of possibility that Meta Platforms will become a $1.5 trillion (by market cap) company within a year. That’s a valuation that would put Meta’s valuation in the same ballpark as other trillion-dollar club members like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt may be strange to say that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the next trillion-dollar companies. Mainly because the EV industry leader was, at one point, a trillion-dollar company. In October 2021, just before the 2021-2022 stock market downturn, TSLA attained a market cap exceeding $1 trillion.\n\nThe stock experienced a massive drawdown from late 2021 through January 2023. Following this, a massive rebound throughout 2023. As a result, TSLA stock is back to a market cap of around $804.8 billion. All that’s necessary to send Tesla back to trillion-dollar status is a 24.25% move higher.\n\nEven as Tesla skeptics point to issues like the EV sales slowdown as signs that TSLA will slide lower in 2024, as I pointed out last week, a potential catalyst could supercharge shares later in the year: the debut of a low-priced, mass-market Tesla EV model.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is another mega-cap that’s halfway towards the trillion-dollar market cap mark. Shares in payment technology companies have produced outsized long-term returns for investors since the stock’s debut in the late 2000s.\n\nFollowing an incredible run from a split-adjusted $15-$20 per share in early 2008 to around $260 per share today, some may expect V stock to produce more modest returns from here. However, the move from cash-based to card/digital-based transactions continues. This company also continues to benefit from having a deep economic moat. It is not far-fetched to think that Visa could continue reporting double-digit annual earnings growth in the years to come.\n\nIn short, Visa is one of the “it’s a matter of when, not if” trillion-dollar contenders. With this, plus the stock’s reasonable valuation (26.3 times earnings) compared to growth forecasts, consider making it a long-term buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Investing Preview 2024: Buy These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Avoid the Others.",
        "content": "Any investing exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks has made your 2023 investing year a big success. This group of mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), has outperformed the broader market despite the Nasdaq Composite surging over 45% last year.\n\nIf it's not broken, don't fix it... right? Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023.\n\n1. Nvidia: Buy\n\nNvidia's chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That's pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAI demand doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia's valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That's a PEG ratio of just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023.\n\n2. Apple: Avoid\n\nNot every \"Magnificent Seven\" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple's revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple's business can be cyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That's fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAnalysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta Platforms: Buy\n\nWall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business, harmful privacy changes to iPhones, and expensive metaverse projects that weren't showing any return on investment. Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs, working through the iPhone challenges, and getting revenue growth and profits back on track. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAstonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta is still a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond.\n\n4. Microsoft: Avoid\n\nChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world's largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it's becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillion market cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock's resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn't as appealing as some other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nIt's not abhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop, there are better deals out there. It's OK for investors to be picky.\n\n5. Amazon: Buy\n\nInterestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOver the past decade, that's over 20% below Amazon's average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing in developing its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That's not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail).\n\n6. Tesla: Avoid\n\nElectric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It's a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla's operating results. Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year. TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it's striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla's future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla's stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy.\n\n7. Alphabet: Buy\n\nAlphabet's dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world's most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock's 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Screaming Buys Right Now?",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks dominated the market in 2023. The worst performer in the group, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), rose 49%, and the best, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), jumped nearly 240%. But with such strong runs behind them, do any of them have room left to grow in 2024?\n\nThe answer: Yes, and some are still worth buying at their current prices.\n\nApple and Nvidia are both richly valued for their performance\n\nI'm breaking the seven up into buy, sell, and hold groups. Starting with the sell set, I think Apple and Nvidia's stock prices far outpaced their businesses.\n\nNvidia's 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, and its business has responded in kind. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), revenue rose 206% year over year. Furthermore, management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue, up 231%. The stock's movement was warranted given the company's sales growth, but I'm concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\n\nNvidia goes through boom and bust cycles, and right now is certainly a boom. However, it's unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term. If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly, the stock may come crashing back down to earth. Plus, it's trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, Apple is the opposite of Nvidia. Its sales declined throughout 2023. Even so, its stock skyrocketed. This makes little sense, and more headwinds are coming up: a U.S. International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume). With all this in mind, 2024 could be a tough year for the company. And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than \"Magnificent Seven\" members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), it doesn't make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft and Tesla need to show me some results\n\nI view Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently. Microsoft had a strong year, as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose. However, Microsoft trades at a steep premium, even on a forward earnings basis. MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nMicrosoft is executing well, but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying. Still, it's far from a sell.\n\nTesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street, as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products. It's also set to face some added headwinds. Starting in 2024, some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them.\n\nWhen judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock, I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends. For Tesla, these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022. TSLA PE Ratio Chart\n\nI'm taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesn't look like a bargain at these prices.\n\nAdvertising should bounce back in 2024\n\nThat leaves Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category. These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year.\n\nEven though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments, they are mostly advertising businesses. In 2022 and 2023, the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming. However, now that we have lapped that pullback, Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses. Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24%, respectively, in Q3.\n\nNext year should be another strong recovery year for advertising, which will boost both companies.\n\nAmazon has also had a strong 2023, with its margins rising. AMZN Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nHowever, this chart doesn't tell the full story, as this takes into account Amazon's profits over the past 12 months. If you focus on its latest quarterly results, Amazon's margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4, which is usually its strongest one. No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, but 2024 could give us a glimpse, making it a strong buy now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Meta Platforms Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "content": "Many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer, Susan J. Li, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$306 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$354. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 11% of Susan J. Li's holding.\n\nMeta Platforms insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nInsiders At Meta Platforms Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. In total, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth sold US$2.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Meta Platforms insiders own about US$126b worth of shares (which is 14% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Meta Platforms Tell Us?\n\nAn insider sold Meta Platforms shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Meta Platforms. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should know about.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "title": "2 FAANG Stocks to Buy in 2024 and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "The stock market has soared over the last decade. A $10,000 investment made in a market-tracking fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) at the start of 2014 would be worth $29,673 today after having grown at a compound annual rate of 11.6%, assuming that dividends were reinvested along the way.\n\nBut the handful of elite stocks known as the FAANG group has delivered even stronger returns. In the last decade, an equal-weighted and dividend-reinvested portfolio of these five stocks would have grown from $10,000 to $89,051. That's a mind-blowing 24.7% compound annual growth rate. It was a bumpy ride, as the FAANG portfolio outperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracker in five years and underperformed in the other five, but stellar results of 2015, 2020, and 2023 outweighed the weak 2022 period.\n\nIn case you're not familiar with FAANG, I'm talking about these familiar companies:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google.\n\nThe mildest 10-year gain among these top-shelf stocks was 400% for Alphabet. At the other end of the scale, Apple led the way with an 867% share price increase. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker is also the only dividend payer of the bunch; reinvesting those payouts would have lifted an investor's total return on Apple stock to a cool 1,000% in 10 years.\n\nBut even the members of this exclusive club aren't always indisputable buys. Right now, I see two excellent investment opportunities for 2024 in this bunch, but one that investors should avoid until further notice.\n\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 1: Alphabet\n\nThe Google parent took a hard fall in 2022. Both of its dual-class stock types fell by as much as 42% as the company was hamstrung by a rickety global economy and a weak digital advertising market. Overall, Alphabet's stock has gone essentially nowhere over the past two years, posting a loss of 3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, its formerly stalled growth is back in action now. Alphabet's trailing-12-month sales stand at $297 billion today, up from $258 billion in fiscal year 2021. That's 15% higher, in case you prefer to think in percentages. Free cash flow rose from $67 billion to $78 billion over the same period, a 16% increase.\n\nAbove all, Alphabet's future looks bright. The advertising market is coming back from its inflation-induced slump. Google Cloud is a leading provider of cloud-based access to powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and the company even designs its own AI accelerator microchips.\n\nSo Alphabet's stock chart has stalled while the business rekindled its fading growth. These days, Alphabet shares can be had at the modest valuations of 27 times trailing earnings and 23 times free cash flows. These readings stand below their long-term averages, and you know Alphabet will stay relevant in the long run. Ergo, this looks like a great time to scoop up some Alphabet shares on the cheap.\n\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 2: Netflix\n\nIf Alphabet took a bruising in 2022, the market took Netflix behind the woodshed for a proper pummeling. The streaming video pioneer's stock dropped by as much as 72% last year, and despite a strong rebound, Netflix still trades 19% below where it ended 2021. After a brief period when its investment theme was horror story, the company looks more like a wholesome family-friendly feature again, and well worth binge-investing in.\n\nThe thing is, the big drop it took in 2022 never made sense to me. Investors essentially punished Netflix for doing exactly what they had been hoping it would do -- putting a fresh focus on margins and profitable revenue growth. Management's enhanced desire for profitability came at the cost of slower customer growth, which used to be the most essential figure to watch in each of Netflix's quarterly reports. Old habits die hard, and the market's reaction to Netflix's updated strategy was brutal.\n\nNow, Netflix's stock price has approximately tripled from the multiyear low it touched in mid-2021. The most glaringly obvious opportunity to take advantage of the buying window is behind us. Still, Netflix strikes me as a solid buy with reignited growth engines and modest valuation ratios. In particular, Netflix stock is cheaper than ever on a price-to-free-cash-flow basis, which is the exact financial metric the company's critics used to complain about the most.\n\nCash flows may dip somewhat in 2024 as Netflix's content production projects get back on track after the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023, but the long-term trend is clear. Netflix is no longer seeking customers at any cost. Instead, the company is optimizing its cash flows and profits, even at the cost of slower subscriber growth. I'm perfectly fine with that switch, and Wall Street as a whole should eventually embrace it as well.\n\nUntil then, Netflix remains a no-brainer buy in my book.\n\nThe FAANG stock to avoid in 2024: Meta Platforms\n\nI'm not here to throw Meta Platform under the bus, but the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp just doesn't look like a buy right now.\n\nThe company's all-in bet on the metaverse is years away from paying metaphorical dividends. The Reality Labs division's revenues amount to a rounding error in Meta's overall financial structure, clocking in at 0.6% of total sales in the recent third-quarter report. But management is leaning into that potential growth driver with all its might. Those $210 million in third-quarter revenues came at the cost of an operating loss of $3.7 billion for the Reality Labs division.\n\nBut the company exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of this year's four earnings reports and investors see Mark Zuckerberg's business as a promising AI innovator. So the stock has gained 198% in 2023, largely erasing 2022's price drop.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Anders,\" I hear you say. \"Isn't this the same story as Alphabet, which experienced similar share price trends and advertising quirks over the last two years? If you like Alphabet, you should love Meta Platforms too.\"\n\nWell, I see the similarities, but Meta's situation is dramatically different from Alphabet's. The company formerly known as Facebook may have some AI ideas in its holster, but it can't match Google's decades of AI expertise or the AI-infused heft of the Google Cloud service. And if AI is supposed to save Meta from its low-growth morass, the heavy spending on metaverse projects must be viewed as an expensive distraction.\n\nIn sum, Meta Platforms seems like a momentum-powered stock right now, and I'm not convinced that AI will be a game-changer for the company. If and when the broader market reaches the same conclusion, Meta's stock could experience a painful price correction. Until then, I'd rather keep my hands off this overheated social media stock, even if it is part of the market-beating FAANG group.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.
